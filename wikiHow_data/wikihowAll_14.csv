Find paper or posterboard you like.,
Decide on how you will decorate your poster.,
Make a model poster.,
Make your candidacy clear.,

You could choose to make a rhyme to help people remember your name and position, like ""Don't be a loon!,
Choose other elements to include on your poster.,
Think of a motto on your poster.,
Don't trash other people.,
Find out where you are allowed to put posters.,
Enlist your friends to help you place posters.,
Monitor your posters.",How to Make Student Council Posters," Think about whether you want to make a few larger posters on posterboard or many posters on regular paper to put everywhere. You could also choose to do both. Go to a office supply store and figure out your options. For continuity, and to make it easy for people to remember you and your campaign, you might want to choose a color scheme that you stick to in your posters -- red and black or blue and white -- whatever you choose. Avoid neon colors, as some may think it is too bright. , If you're artistic, think about how to use your skills best. If you aren't artistically-minded, think of other ways to get people's attention. Stickers can also be fun, but might get expensive if you make a lot of posters.Will you draw something, or create it on the computer?
What kind of impression do you want to create -- professional, funky, well-organized?
Do you want to include an image of you? Photo or drawn?

, Have friends and family look at it and give you suggestions. Once you’ve decided if you want to incorporate their suggestions, work on making a final version of your model. If it’s posterboard, you’re going to have to replicate it multiple times. If it’s something you can copy, all you’ll have to do is find a place where you can make the copies of your model poster., Put the position you are running for in a place on the poster that is easy to read. Your voters need to know what they are voting you in for. Also make your name central to the poster, including your last name.

Add a picture of yourself to the poster, so people who don't know personally will now know exactly who you are. You don't have to look model-esque, just approachable and friendly.

, Vote June for School Council President!"" Below you can write your full name, since “June” might not be enough to identify you.
Or you can be more straightforward. “For School Council President, Vote June Larson.”

, Do you have a platform or issue you want to work on while in office? If so, make that clear. Think about what you want to change at your school. Why are you running? Your posters should give voters some idea.""Vote Jill for a cleaner Lunchroom! Jill Hernandez will make a great VP!""
”Scott Rogowski will make lockers safer. Give him your vote for Vice President.”

, It might be one tied to your issue, but it can also be more general. Any way that you can help people remember you and your campaign when they’re voting can help. Some sample mottoes might be:”Let’s make our school even better next year!”
”Vote me for a hard-working president/vp/etc.”

, Make your campaign about you and what you can offer. Getting negative often backfires, and it’s likely that you will end up working with your opponent on something in the future. It’s not worth it to make an enemy over a school council campaign when you could just keep the campaign positive. Don’t make posters with phrases like the following:


""Lill stinks! Vote for the prez that thinks!""
”No more David Tan. No one here should be his fan!”

, Some schools have designated areas where posters have to be. In other schools, you can get creative. Talk to teachers or school administrators to find out., You want to get the maximum coverage, so put your posters up strategically. If there’s a bulletin board with lots of posters already on it, you might want to look for another place. Have your friends stand back from the walls to see if your poster is visible in the places you choose. If you can, choose unusual locations to put your posters. Some different places might be:Bathrooms
Stairwells
Outside

, Make sure that no one takes them down. Have extras in case you need to put more up or see places later that you think could use a poster. Once the election is over, it’s a good idea to go around taking down your posters and getting them recycled. Hopefully you won, but even if you didn’t, you know more for your next campaign!

Ask school officials to help.If you go to your school officials and ask them to help you improve school spirit, they will be thrilled.,
Talk to your teachers about ways to work school spirit into lesson plans.,
Ask parents and the community to help encourage school spirit.",How to Improve School Spirit," If you have a uniform, jersey, letter jacket, etc. that shows your school’s colors, you can wear that, but any clothing of the right color will show your spirit. You can wear the colors any day that you are permitted to, but it shows extra spirit to wear them on game days and at other special times.


Encourage your friends to wear school colors with you. The more people that participate, the more spirit you’ll show!;
, There are lots of ways to show your spirit with fun items. For instance:


If you have artistic skill, make posters that show your school mascot, motto, etc. You can use these to show spirit on game days, for instance, with fun slogans about your team and/or the opposing team, like “Go Tigers! Soufflé those Cheesy Badgers!”
Make shakers out of plastic bottles filled with beans, beads, coins, or other small items, and decorate them with paint, ribbons, stickers, etc. in your school’s colors. Bring them to events and pep rallies to make noise and show your spirit.

, Many schools designate someone to serve as the mascot (or a group of people to take turns doing it). Don the costume, show your spirit, and get everyone excited!,

Music is an easy way to get people excited. Special songs about your school are even better!

Many schools have a special alma mater, or associated song. Learn the words and melody to yours!
Some schools also have a special fight song that is sung at sporting events and pep rallies to show spirit for your school and encourage friendly competition.
If your school doesn’t have an alma mater or fight song, draw on your creative skills and write one, or compose one together with your friends.

,

Showing up for school events is key when you want to improve spirit. If you want to encourage others to have school spirit, set a good example and show up for events yourself. The more people show up, the more it will inspire others to come too. Good events to show up for include:

Games
Pep rallies
Homecoming celebrationsCompetitions (debate, math team, quiz bowl, etc.)
Performances (drama, music, etc.)

,

Showing school spirit also means participating as much as you can outside of the classroom. Many students find a way to get involved in some kind of extracurricular activity or another. Doing so shows that you care about contributing to part of what makes your school special. Examples include:

SportsBandCheerleadingDance teamSchool newspaper
Alumni ambassadors,

School-sponsored clubs and organizations are special kinds of extracurricular activities. They offer ways for students to get together and share their enthusiasm for an interest. For instance, knitting club could knit scarves to give away in the name of your school to those in need in your community. If you are interested in something and your school doesn’t have a club for it, get together with your friends and a sponsor and start one! Common clubs include:Art Club
Diversity Club (sponsors heritage months, supports inclusive environments, etc.)
Chorus
Drama Club
Technology Club
Science Olympiad
Foreign language clubs (French, Spanish, German, Japanese, etc.)
Chess Club
Photography Club
Math Team
Crotchet Club
Knitting Club
Leadership organizations
Debate Team
Literary journal/magazine
Green Club (interests in recycling, sustainability, conservation, etc.)
Pep squad

,

Every chance you have, tell people about your pride in your school, encourage them to come to events, and help them find a way to get involved. Keep in mind that not everyone has to participate in the same way.

For instance, if someone doesn’t like coming to games, he or she might be a great participant in a school club. Those who like going to games can also show up for their classmates in drama performances, academic competitions, or other events.
Everyone working together to show spirit will make your school great!

, Raising money on behalf of your school is a great way to show school spirit. If your school has a project, club, event, or something else that needs funding, get together with your friends and take action! For instance, French Club could hold a bake sale selling croissants and éclairs to raise money for your school. Or, if you want to raise money or items for your community, you can do so in the name of your school as a way of showing spirit. Some good ideas include:

Bake sales
Candy sales
Art auction
Book drive
Dance marathons
5k runs
Car wash
Carnival
Game night
Ask local stores, restaurants, etc. to donate gift certificates or merchandise. You can then sell raffle tickets to win these prizes.

, Ask your school officials or a teacher to approve one or more of these traditions during homecoming or other special times:Tacky day (for fun, everyone wears clothes that are intentionally silly, mismatched, etc.)
Wear pajamas to school day
Dress up day (everyone wears formal clothing for the day--suits, nice dresses, etc.)
Twin day (friends dress exactly like each other)
Wacky Wednesday (wear costumes—the more outlandish, the better)
School color day
Super hero vs. villain day (some people dress as super heroes, some as villains)
Ninja vs. Pirate day (some people dress as ninjas, others as pirates)

, It might seem obvious, but a good pep rally should be filled with ways to get people excited. Plan routines that will encourage school spirit.


Have upbeat music playing as people enter the pep rally, as well as during it.
Invite the marching band to perform.
Have cheerleaders perform some routines, and also work the crowd to participate in cheers.
Invite a dance group to perform while wearing school colors.
Have everyone sing your school’s alma mater or fight song.
Get everyone moving! Try the “wave” and other hand motions.

,

One way you can encourage people to come and participate in a pep rally is to offer door prizes. These can be simple things like candy, pom-poms, a jersey, etc.—anything fun. You can also ask area businesses to donate merchandise or gift certificates to give away as pep rally door prizes.,

Before the pep rally starts, tape treats or prizes (such as candy, balloons, pom-poms, t-shirts, etc.) underneath some of the seats. Then, during the pep rally, take a moment to have everyone look under their seat to see if they have a prize. All the winners can then join in a cheer., Have a group of students sign up to be the “Rowdy Rooters.”These students can sit in a special section during the pep rally, hold signs and noisemakers, and be especially enthusiastic during cheers and songs. You can also have students sign up or enter a drawing for a turn at joining the Rowdy Rooters.

,

An MC can lead the pep rally, by telling people about the different events and performances that are part of it, and by generally being enthusiastic. You can ask a popular teacher or an especially excited student to serve as the pep rally MC.,

Everyone enjoys seeing their teachers have fun and show school spirit. You can ask enthusiastic faculty members to get together and perform their own cheers and get the crowd to participate.,

Having your mascot there to represent your school at a pep rally is a fun way to encourage school spirit. There are lots of ways to get the mascot involved:

Players can carry the mascot into the pep rally on a chair. The mascot can serve as the “king” of the pep rally if it wears a crown and the chair is decorated like a throne.
Ask the mascot to take part in a cheer or dance.
Have the mascot play a game against someone dressed as the opposing team’s mascot (and win, of course).

,

Any pep rally can improve school spirit. However, it can be fun and encourage people to participate if you vary things sometimes and have a pep rally with a particular theme. For instance:

Hold a “Downtown” pep rally where everyone dresses up in formal wear. Cheerleaders, for instance, can wear top hats and tails.
Have a “blackout” pep rally where the lights are turned out, and cheerleaders, band, etc. use glow-in-the-dark clothing or items. Glow sticks can be distributed to students so that they can participate.
Try a “Blast from the Past.”Decorate the pep rally according to a certain decade (the 60’s, the 80’s, etc.) or time period (Roman, prehistoric, etc.). Choose appropriate music, and ask participants to wear clothes that fit the theme.

, Talk to them about any ideas you have, and ask them to participate as well. For instance:


School officials could wear school colors or jerseys on game days.
You could ask your school officials for permission to occasionally use part of school time for a pep rally. Tell them that holding a pep rally during school hours will ensure that people come and improve their school spirit.
Ask your principal or headmaster to share a special cheer, song, or encouraging thought with the school at the start or end of each day.
Talk to your school officials about starting a school Hall of Fame. This could include pictures, plaques, awards, and other information about students and athletes from your school that have made notable accomplishments.
Ask your principal to agree to do a stunt, wear a ridiculous hat, or something else fun if students accomplish a goal like raising a certain amount of money for the community.

,

Teachers might agree to let you use class time for an activity that will raise school spirit if you can show that it will also be productive. For instance:

Students in a history, writing, or journalism class can work together to write a history of your school. Topics could include things like the founding of the school, notable alumni, academic and athletic accomplishments, and key dates in the history of the school.
Students in art class could work on painting signs and posters for pep rallies and other events while practicing their drawing and other artistic skills at the same time.
Students in a drama or creative writing class could develop fun and educational skits to share at pep rallies or other events. For instance, students could write a skit about what life was like at your school 25 years ago.

,

There are lots of ways for parents, local businesses and organizations, and community members to get involved in your school. Some possibilities include

Ask a teacher, parent, or other adult about starting a Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO), also known as a Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) if your school doesn’t already have one.
Ask the PTO to take charge of some activities, such as planting a school community garden.
Ask local businesses or organizations about becoming a community service partner (CSP) with your school. A CSP can help raise funds for various causes. For instance, a CSP can help bring in donations for school groups that want to send care packages to soldiers abroad, or to students in developing nations.
Ask parents and community members to help you get in touch with school alumni. These former students can raise school spirit; for instance, you could invite accomplished alumni to come and speak at an event or pep rally to encourage students to succeed.
Make sure to ask parents and community members to come to games, performances, competitions, and other events. Seeing everyone there will encourage both school and community pride!

Beautify your school.,
Start a garden.,
Paint a mural.,
Lead a campaign to make your school grounds healthier.",How to Improve Your School1," Increasing your school’s “curb appeal” is one of the fastest and most inexpensive ways of improving it. Take a look around your school and see what kind of cosmetic changes you might be able to easily make. Picking weeds, pruning hedges, planting flowers, giving walls a fresh coat of paint, and picking trash up out of a field or parking lot are all ways of quickly making things look better., A school garden that students and staff can work on is a great way to increase involvement and pride in your school. Talk to your school administrators about getting permission first.A school garden can be whatever type people like—a flower garden, a vegetable garden, etc.
Work on the garden can be tied into educational activities. Science classes, for example, can learn about photosynthesis or the life cycle of plants by helping out with the garden.

, Making an inspiring painting part of your school is sure to improve it. Your school can start a discussion and vote on the design, which could be a school mascot, a historical figure, a local landmark, etc. Art classes at your school can even get involved with making the mural.


If your school wants to commission an outside artist to paint your mural, make sure the design, budget, and timeline for completion are worked out beforehand., Some schools, particularly older ones, may have hazardous substances present, such as lead paint, lead pipes, or asbestos. Removing these substances can be expensive and complicated. However, if members of your school community are concerned about these substances, talk to administrators or the local school board about what can be done to improve the school."
"
Boost activities and clubs.,
Make school more engaging.,
Go green.,
Encourage healthy eating.,
Fundraise.",How to Improve Your School2," If enthusiasm or a sense of community seems to be lacking at your school, then you may want to increase extracurricular opportunities. There can be something for everyone to get involved in—the sky’s the limit!

Cheerleading
Art Club
Drama Club
Garden Club
Technology Club
Future Business Leaders
Mock trial

Volleyball Club

, if you feel that your school needs improving because it is boring, don’t give up hope! Talk to teachers, school administrators, and students about developing ways to make learning fun and more engaging. If the goal is to innovate and improve your school, then everyone will be on board and willing to develop ideas., If you feel like your school would be improved if everyone tried to be more eco-friendly, there are many opportunities to take action. Talk to members of your school community about gathering support for ideas like:Choosing eco-friendly school supplies

Making sure that recycling bins are available at your school
Replacing paper towel dispensers with blown air hand dryers
Starting a compost pile
Planting trees for Earth Day
Having an end-of-the day check to make sure that lights are turned off, windows are closed, and that other techniques to conserve energy are being used.

, There are many conversations going on now about improving school meals and eating healthier in general. If these issue are important to you, try leading a campaign to ban candy, junk food, and soda vending machines on your school grounds. You can also talk with your school officials about how to offer healthier choices at meal times., If there is a project at your school that needs financial support, whether it is painting a mural or purchasing school supplies for needy students, you can help start a fundraising campaign. There are lots of ideas, such as:


Holding a garage sale
Asking local merchants to contribute coupons or gift certificates that can be sold in a raffle
Hosting a silent auction for student artwork
Hosting a game night with an entrance fee

Let everyone join in.,
Be nice to new people.,
Don’t gossip or badmouth others.,
Don’t accept bullying.",How to Improve Your School3," Make sure that all students have a chance to participate in activities and games, no matter what their skill level or ability. For example, when playing a game that only takes 8 players at a time, rotate people in and out, so that everyone can have a chance. Letting all students have a chance, even if they aren’t great at the game, will make things more fun and friendly., Being new at a school can make a person feel lonely. Whenever there is a new student at your school, make a special effort to make him or her feel welcome.Invite the new student to sit with you at lunch.
Introduce him or her to your friends.
Make sure the new student is included in games and activities.

, You can help keep your school a positive place by not taking part in talking badly about other people. If others around you are saying mean things, don’t be afraid to tell them that its not nice, and that they should stop.If someone tries to gossip with you, you can say you don’t want to talk behind someone’s back, or just change the subject.
If you someone says something bad about someone else, try saying something like: “Hey, that’s not cool. I don’t think it’s fair to talk about like that.”

, Bullying can be a very serious problem, and shouldn’t be tolerated. If you think there it has become a problem at your school, talk to a school administrator about ways to address the issue. You can also help stop any bullying you witness. If you see someone picking on someone else (offline or online), you don’t have to just let it happen:Don’t laugh or just watch what happens. Say something like: “That’s not nice. Why don’t you leave alone?”
Be a friend. If you see someone being picked on, make an extra effort to be nice to him or her. It will make a big difference if that person knows he/she is not alone.
Avoid physical confrontation if possible.
Tell a trusted adult about what you saw happen, whether or not you intervened.

"
"
Talk to administrators.,
Ask parents to get involved.,
Use social media to gather support.,
Let people contribute in their own way.,
Ensure that improvements continue.",How to Improve Your School4," If you think that your school needs improvement, you can start by talking to its administrators (a principal or headmaster, for example). You might also attend local school board meetings to voice your opinion. Getting administrative support is important not only because many projects will need official approval, but also because it is a way of communicating your concerns.Don’t be shy about asking to meet with your school administrators. If you are serious about improving your school and have some ideas, most will be happy to hear from you.

, Schools aren’t just places for students to learn—they are also an important cornerstone of any community. Families also care about schools and will want to be involved with any improvements that need to be made. Parents can get together at a Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) meeting, school board meeting, booster club event, or other opportunity and consider ways of helping to improve your school., While some people may not think that social media have educational value, social networks can be a powerful tool for organizing people. Make sure that your school is active on all major social media services. If it isn’t, talk to your school administrators about getting started. Anytime your school has an improvement campaign or project going on, advertise it widely using these services to boost involvement., Many school improvements will need a lot of support. However, this doesn’t mean that everyone has to contribute in the same way. When raising support to improve your school, make sure that people understand there is room for everyone to help. For example:Some might be great at organizing people, while others will have talents in writing or design.
Some will be able to devote time during school hours only, while others will have more time after school hours or on weekends.
Some might be able to get involved on the school grounds itself, while others might be great at gathering support for your school within the surrounding community (by fundraising, for example).

, Efforts to improve your school will only have their full impact if they can continue in the future. Creating a sense of school history, or institutional memory, is important for to long-term success.Elect someone to be school historian. He or she can make notes about any improvements that are made to your school, and then pass the information along to the next historian.
See if your school can set aside a space for this purpose. This might be a place in the library or office to keep notes on your school history, and/or a memorial wall that can have photos, plaques, and other items to commemorate your school.

Have good hygiene.,
Be mature.,
Be nice to everyone, even if it's your worst enemy.,
If you get things that aren't a particular perfect girl thing, just try to not make a big deal about it.,
Try to get good grades.,
Eat healthy.,
Be confident.,
Smile a lot.,
Try to be natural.,
Don't gossip about people.",How to Seem Like the Perfect Girl," This means taking proper care of your teeth, hair, and body. This also means eat fresh foods like fruits and vegetables, not a bag of potato chips, although, once in a while is fine.;
, So no smashing someone's window as a dare or pulling someone's pants down. Walk elegantly, with poise and charm. Straighten your back, hold your head up, speak about mature things, and have manners, don't goof off at inappropriate times, unless you want to be the class clown.


Don't talk about disgusting things, like bodily fluids, functions, or inappropriate things. Engage into a different discussion if this situation ever arises.
Play games such as truth or dare, spin the bottle, etc. But never go too far!

, Being nice to people means more friends, which is great.

, So don't tell everybody you're getting braces, or you need glasses.


If you do get braces, aim for more neutral colors like: white, pale pink. Just something not so noticeable like fluorescent orange. Clear braces are ideal.
If you get glasses, ask for contacts instead. If your parents are against it, ask them why. If it helps, promise not to wear colored contacts.

, Study, do homework, and take exams. Don't stress about tests, but if you're certain you'll fail, study!


Write hints, tips, and notes on index flash cards.

, This will make you feel better about yourself. High self-esteem means a happier you! Everyone likes to be around a cheery, happy person, and not a depressed sob.

, People like confident people and are drawn to them. Speak loudly enough and clearly to kids and adults. Smile when you walk down the hall, and start discussions with people.

, It makes you look prettier and more approachable. People are more likely to be open to an enthusiastic, smiling person, rather than a person sitting in a corner with their head down.

, Don't dye your hair all the time, or be caked with foundation. A streak of colorful hair dye or a bit of lip gloss is okay, but don't overdo it!

, If you gossip about other people, your friends may begin to wonder if you start gossip about them. It may also give you a bad or stuck up reputation which is the last thing you want when trying to seem perfect.

Know who you want to get noticed by.,
Plan your actions.,
Have confidence.,
Small talk to people.,
Make new friends.,
Spend time with your friends.,
Follow people's social media profiles.,
Keep up with trends.,
Stay clean and tidy.,
Take good care of your body.,
Start a trend.,
Be fashionable.,
Get into a relationship when ready.",How to Get Noticed in Middle School," You might want to get noticed by your crush, one of the popular kids or maybe from someone else. You should choose different approaches to get noticed by different people.;
, Before you try to get noticed by someone, think about how you're going to do it. Try to come up with a few questions or a conversation starter such as the following below:


'Hi, what's your name?'
'What's your favourite colour?'
'It's a beautiful day today!'
'Do you like this school?'
'What are your plans on the weekend?'

, If you want to be noticed you have to get out there and have confidence in yourself. If you're quite shy you probably won't get noticed, you need to be sociable, fun and outgoing.

, Try to start a conversation with people you don't know much. Be sure to listen to what they say and don't hate on their opinions. Small talk can be about the weather, pets, favourite TV shows, etc.


Make a good first impression on people. Don't ignore someone or call them names because everyone else is doing it. If you become the kindest person in school people will know you for it and you'll most likely become popular.
Go with the flow. If your group are talking about cats don't go completely off topic by saying ""last week I went to Florida with my cousins"" because chances are, you'll probably be ignored. If they are laughing, laugh with them. While on topic, don't forget to say your opinion as well or share your own story about what everyone's talking about.

, Try to become friends with a range of different people. Your friends might mention you to other people and then you will become noticed. However don't be friends with someone who isn't nice to you or is a bully, be friends with people who are kind and respect you.

, Whether it's during school time, after school or on the weekend, plan a get together for you and your friends to catch up. Try to find fun and exciting places to go such as the pool, mall or the movies. Every now and then you could have a sleep over or go to each overs houses but choose a different destination each time.

, If you know a persons full name, consider following them on a social media site such as Instagram, Twitter or Facebook to know more about them. Even send them a friend request to get noticed.


Stay active. Post a photo every now and then so people know who you are and your kind of personality. If someone comments on your post reply back to them but don't say anything rude or mean towards them or others.
You can comment on your own posts but not too much otherwise people might start ignoring you. However, you should always reply to a question or compliment to show people that you are kind and that you care.

, Update your wardrobe to clothing that is in fashion right now and download any new music. It helps if you listen to music that everyone else likes or is in the top 100 list.


Don't change your fashion or music taste just because everyone else likes it. If you like the type of music you listen to or if you find your current clothes comfortable don't change them for others.

, No one likes to hang around someone who smells or is unorganized. Shower regularly, brush your hair, clean your teeth and face, keep your clothes tidy, don't scuff your shoes, etc.

, Make sure to stay hydrated and eat a well balanced diet that consists of plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables. Exercise daily and practice good hygiene.

, Starting a trend is sure to get you noticed and talked about around school. Try starting a new hair style or fashion accessory.

, Try different hair styles, accessories, shoes, clothes etc. You could even put on some light make up if you're allowed. If you look nice and wear something new everyday you're sure to get noticed and liked for it.

, If you're allowed, consider getting a boyfriend/girlfriend. This is sure to be the talk around school but don't be pressured into a relationship if you don't think you're ready. Don't be desperate for a relationship but don't be hard to get either. If you only want a boyfriend to use them, you'll get a bad reputation and people might stay away from you because of this.

Strike up a conversation.,
Say nice things like ""I like your shirt, where did you get it?"",
Talk.,
The new kid willing to sit at any table or currently sit at a table with a bunch of strangers you don't know, you should at least talk to somebody and get a couple of appropriate laughs.,
Expect the unexpected.,

Don't be a show off, nosey, selfish or conceited.",How to Make a Lot of Friends in Middle School,";
, or things like ""did you see the that new movie yet? This gives them an idea of you being a possible friend in the future. You should smile politely as well if you want to give that friendliness a lasting affect.


It's a great idea to have a chance to communicate to someone you don't know in your school because there could be totally awesome benefits and happy endings if you were to be in a little situation. Most likely, if the person you had a conversation with was a nice person, they may help you out in coincidence later on.

,


Try to start conversations with other people and see if you guys have anything in common or have similar interests. Even if you are very different.

,


Getting to know people is very important because you will never know who will do what or what will happen next. Knowing people may help you solve many puzzles in some situations too.

,


You will never truly know who's the ""culprit"" to your social problems or the ""one"" you should give all of your trust to. It's best to build up a very strong foundation of common sense and increase your awareness of all of your surroundings. Do not be surprised if someone doesn't like you for no reason.
One thing to solve that is to talk to the person without freaking out or blaming. Use ""I-messages"" or try to be GREAT friends with that person. If they didn't like you because of a silly rumor or vice versa, don't be in a myopic state of mind. Think for a little while before you take action.
Do anything you wish to solve that problem but it is extremely critical that you avoid doing anything that: is mean or interrupts the educational environment, is harassment or assault, ruins anybody's life, will ruin your own egoism, could be deadly (literally), or doesn't make any sense at all. If you do anything that has alike consequences with that list of things before this sentence, it's a likely possibility of you getting into deep trouble. Trust me, not many people would like to hang out with a person for too long if that person gets in trouble very often.

,


Please, being yourself is never easy, but not being yourself could get you somewhere you wouldn't want to be. Even if you are a nerd, it's best to be in a friendly group where you feel secure and belonged honestly than being lonely, horribly confused, and a big pretender with people always being suspicious about you.
Also, if you don't feel comfortable in any stressing situation, just say so. Lying will take the skills of a super ingenious strategist for a whole day and being stuck in a tangled web of lies can lead to way more trouble than you had when you told the truth.

,


If you want to hang out with your friends and be together more often, join school activities such as clubs or extracurricular activities. The things that you do in school may contain people who share a similar reason to be in that activity like you or may have some of the same goals as you.
If you don't feel too comfortable with school activities, try planning a fun event where people from your school you know or want to know can come and have a wonderful time. For instance, you could tell people that they are welcome to come at a local park, movie theatre, ice rink, etc. to have some group fun with a really responsible adult to watch for safe reasons.

, It will just make people hate you.

Shave your legs and underarms, and remove any mustache or excess eyebrow hair. This is completely optional, but it gives you huge points. It also helps prevent too much sweating.






Wash your hair often. In middle school, your hair is likely greasy. If that is true, never go more than 2 days without a washing. Some people in middle school have dry hair. You'll have to go through trail and error, but generally you should not wash your hair more than every 3 days if you have dry hair.
Wear deodorant. Perfume is up to you, but don't wear too much.






Shower every 1-2 days. If you sweat a lot, it's hot outside or you exercised a lot, shower everyday. You should shower if you feel gross or your hair is oily, because you probably smell too.
Wash your face twice a day and apply lotion at least three times a week.





;
, Apply foundation, concealer, brown mascara, and a lip gloss close your natural lip color. Or if you have good skin, go natural.

, Wear accessories and wear your hair differently at least once a week. (Not a simple ponytail!) Read up on fashion and find stuff that fits. Don't use colors that don't match (like brown and black, red and green etc.) and dress for the weather. Avoid anything stained or dirty. Don't wear overly revealing clothes; you're in middle school!

, Don't go flirt with another guy every day. Stick to flirting to one or two guys per week max. If you have a crush or boyfriend, do NOT flirt with anyone but him.You want to be a guy magnet, not a slut.

, Have at least 3 different hobbies. Join at least one school club. Arts and crafts, music, and sports are great examples.

, Limit junk food to once a week. Exercise at least 4 times a week for 60 minutes. Do something different everyday to give a toned body and a great glow. Run one day, bike the next etc.

, This doesn't mean you have to be a genius, but do your homework on time, study, don't fall asleep in class, as simple as that. Don't get anything lower than a C.

, Don't ditch your old friends, but make some new ones. Smile, be nice, go on Facebook or your e-mail, or text often! Keep in touch with your peers!

, Just smile and be happy. There are many ways to be happy 100% of the time! My favorite methods are: Look at where you will be in 10 years, when all your current problems will seem small and insignificant! Or you can simply find something your looking forward to and working toward! And my personal favorite: Play music, a happy upbeat, fast song and just get excited for the day! Get pumped!

",How to Gain Popularity in Middle School," You don't need to be the one who never wears the same outfit twice or has designer clothes but instead just care about what you wear. Don't throw on sweatpants and a graphic tee and go to school looking like you went through a fashion tornado, one thing you can do is to plan your outfit out the night before. Try not to wear the same shirt or pants two days in a row. No one likes anyone who wears ugly and revealing clothes, so keep it modest and cute. Wear clothes from brandy Melville, urban outfitters (they have awesome sales sometimes), forever 21, abercrombie, a&f, or whatever the popular girls wear.;
, Wash your face 2 times everyday; in the morning, and when you go to bed. Wash with lukewarm water for 30 - 45 seconds. Drink half your weight in ounces ex. if you are 100 pounds drink 50 ounces, this will help keep your skin clear. Brush your hair and straighten if it is frizzy and uncontrollable. For static, spray your hair gently with water, but don't make it sopping wet.

, Laugh at other people's jokes! Make your own jokes is you think they can be funny enough, either about you or others or what's going on. Remember though, don't be rude when saying jokes.

, no one likes someone who follows them around and tries to join in the conversation. If a popular girl walks past say, ""hey, your sweater is cute!"" or any compliment that could start a conversation.

, It is both healthy and can help you achieve a more toned body. Also, joining a sports team will help you meet more people.

,, Talk to boys every chance you get, don't flirt unless you like them but it is always nice to have friends who are boys. When there is a dance with other schools it will also be good to have friends from other schools because it will make you seem more popular and established. Don't be the mean, bossy one that no one likes, make most of the kids think you are kind and caring, though they don't have to love you either..

Get in with good crowd. That will help your reputation. Stay away from the bullies, and find your own niche.
Find two or three close friend to always hang with. Walk to school with a few of your friends. Sit together with your friends at lunch.;
, Do your homework and study and get good grades. Do not interrupt the teacher or other peoples conversations, and don't act immature. Try not to be late and make perfect attendance.

, Try a little flirting, but don't let boys get in the way of your grades.

People always want to be a person if they are talented.,
For hair, you need to keep it looking healthy and clean.,
Buy quality flat-irons, crimpers, etc.,
For skin, use a good brand.,
For clothes, this is the super fun part.,
Accessories.,
Friends.,
Be a leader.,
Have cool stuff.,
Study people.",How to Make People Want to Be You (Middle School)," Any sport such as dance, cheer, basketball, soccer, lacrosse, hockey, etc. will do. But then again, everyone can play a sport. That's why a serious talent is mandatory. Anything like playing the flute, being a great poet, or an exotic sport (i.e. rugby, figure skating.) This really intrigues people as to read into you.


If you aren't good at anything, find a random sport and talent and practice, practice, practice. You won't be bad forever. Find a unique talent, something out of the norm so you stand out.





;
, Bumble and Bumble, Paul Mitchell, Pantene, Matrix, Aveda, etc. are all wonderful brands, but whatever works for you is important. ""Works for you"" means looks clean, shiny, smooth, and healthy.


If you are growing your hair out and refuse to cut it, then hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! Otherwise your ends will split and get stringy and your hair will not be long.Scene bangs, long layers, and highlights are very stylish. Highlights are a big must unless you have either banana blonde, slick black, or fiery red locks.(if you have really noticeable natural highlights your fine)







, Conair Deep Wave Iron creates beautiful, soft crimped waves. Get a good blow dryer, Bedhead has great ones. Another very important thing is getting trims and cuts often.

, Clinique, Estee Lauder, Bobbi Brown, and Lancome DO work but what's really important is to get at least eight hours of sleep and drink a ton of water. If you aren't sure what type of skin you have, go to Clinique and get tested. Buy the whole line of your number of skin. Buy concealer, foundation, blush, bronzer, mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and more. Buy what's right for your skin.

, You can shop anywhere really, as long as the clothes are good quality. Wearing Abercrombie or American Eagle will make people want to be you. The key to mixing up your wardrobe is going exactly two weeks without wearing the same piece of clothing, making it look like you have endless amounts of clothes. Shoes are fine to repeat, but definitely not clothes. The most important thing in clothes is to make sure they suit your body. They should fit properly (finding a good tailor can help tremendously) and cover the parts of your body that are covered by a bathing suit. Leaving a bit up to the imagination is extremely attractive because it shows that you aren't the type that will show your body to just anybody. Another thing that helps is first building a wardrobe of basics (plain tees, pants, tanks, cardigans, oxfords, polos, etc.) and then reading fashion magazines to find out the latest trend. Only buy a few of the trendy pieces: Heidi Klum says that in fashion, ""One day you're in, and the next day you're out."" Trends come and go, and you don't want to look like a slave to fashion. Whatever you wear, be comfortable in it, make it yours, and own it!

, Most of these ""It-Girl"" types are in love with Juicy Couture, Coach, Marc Jacobs, or Michael Kors. Or even all four is fine, but you should have a signature brand. You should have two designer bags; a fun one and a basic one. Louis Vuitton and Michael Kors make very nice ones. Also, owning the cutest shoes is key to being a girly girl. Get something stylish, good quality, and appropriate for the occasion. (For example, don't wear platform stilettos to a track meet, it will only make others see you as ridiculous) For starters, make sure you have a pair of cute flats (Juicy Couture and J. Crew make very nice ones), a nice pair of boots (Equestrian boots are all over the place this Fall, although a nice cowboy boot or booty will make you stand out in the crowd. Beware the Uggs though, they're a thing of the past), a pair of special occasion shoes (cute heels, not tacky ones), and a cute pair of sneakers or everyday shoes like Toms. For jewelry, Juicy Couture has really nice pieces, but get a tad pricy. If you cannot afford Juicy Couture jewelry for daily wear, American Eagle has great jewelry. It doesn't look cheap or knockoff-ish. But it does break easily, so careful!

, It's very important to have friends. Having a best friend isn't quite mandatory, but it is quite beneficial. Make sure your friend knows the real you, because otherwise your relationship will most likely fall apart, and that's ugly and unglamorous. Your friend should be a good listener, a good critic, kind, and cool.

, Always have back-up plans, impressive things to say, and ideas for your friends. Be admirable. You need to take the front role to make sure that everyone is always following. If all your friends want to have a sleepover, you throw it. If your school has elections, run for president. If you want it, go for it and people will admire your confidence.


Popularity is not key but does help. You don't need to be a Regina George but do you really want to be a Layne Abeley? Popular people are usually talented, pretty, charming, spontaneous, and smart. Popularity, however, is temporary and fickle. Don't confuse popularity and happiness because they are completely unrelated in the real world.







, Have a really fun bedroom; Ikea and PB Teen have great pieces. PB Teen IS expensive, but they have amazing quality and seriously gorgeous.


A ""cool stuff"" girl is usually constantly envied. You don't have to be rich, but you will need a ton of money for this article. The ""cool stuff"" includes; Juicy hoodies, a bunch of lipgloss, a credit card, and designer purses. Also, Macbooks, iPhones, and LV bags work too. You do want to be envied.







, Admire people. Have an inspiration. Pick someone, anyone. Pick a few people and combine them! Ideas for people are Massie Block, Audrey Hepburn, Jacqueline Onassis, Selena Gomez, or Miley Cyrus.

If you still don't know what your own personality is, then find out! Don't copy others. Being popular means being yourself and nobody else. It doesn't matter if you are weird or plain, you can be popular.;
, People tend to stay away from people who gossip because they think that you would talk about them. If one of your friends gossips about others, there's a big chance they gossip about you to others.

, There's nothing better than making other people laugh. It makes other people feel nice and better. Even if your a very shy person, if you do/say something funny, people will realize what a great person hides inside that cocoon. Crack a joke every now and then, but don't overdo it. Don't be a big class clown. Be normal and funny.

, Being popular means letting the world see you, so join some new clubs. Go to school dances. Sure, join the chess club and be the most popular chess member. The quickest way to get popular is to be good at things you like. This way you gain popularity through groups. Another good way is to attend the local events such as open mic night or something along those lines, you'll be able to make to friends and talk to your friends, which plays a big role in becoming the popular girl. Recommended activities for popularity are doing two sports, 2 clubs, and being in Advanced or IB classes. Good clubs to join are clubs of you interest.

, You can't be popular if you're shy and blank all the time. Be talkative, be funny, be hyper, and be enthusiastic. You have to learn how to be totally fun and cool so that people will like you more and pay more attention to you. Take the time to talk to the new girl and become her friend. Talk to the person in front of you in the lunch line. Really, you can talk to anybody you like, as long as they don't have a bad reputation. Don't be afraid to say hi to random people.

, Because of the stereotypes, people think that popular girls are mean, snobby, and self absorbed. You can show them that you're not like that. Be kind to everyone you meet, even the people that may dislike you. It is true that some popular girls fit the stereotypes, but the Queen Bees are truly nice, flirty, happy, and fun people.

, A popular kid's reputation could be ruined by doing something nasty. As mentioned before, you have to be fun and enthusiastic, but never go too far. Don't take many risks. You don't want to be kicked out of school for nonsense reasons. Try not to ever get a detention, referral, suspension, or even worse, an expulsion.

, Don't be a blatantly obvious teacher's pet that gets people to call you names and make fun of you. Ask the teacher to help you out. Always raise your hand and study a lot. Make sure that you know the answers. Make the teacher be proud of you. Get a high level in schoolwork. It's another key to being popular. You have to be good at studies so that people don't go around accusing you of failing and being a loser at school all the time. Getting in the Top 5% isn't required, but it is a nice additive. Remember to not completely consume your life with studying.

, Make your rule number one: don't copy others. Make others copy you. You're your own person, and it's important to make others feel inspired. Being popular means being original. So, you can wear all the popular brands and one day wear an Izod polo with a cardigan and cute shorts. People will soon follow your unusual new style.

, It means having QUALITY friends. Don't mix up the difference. So, you can make a bunch of ""friends"" but you also need to have a select few FRIENDS.

, If all of your friends like you, and people who you just met like you, popular people may start to like you. If this is the case, you might make some popular friends and become popular!

, In seventh grade, some girls choose cut down on Aeropostale and move on to Hollister and A & F. This doesn't mean that you can't still wear Aeropostale; dress however makes you comfortable. Jeans and leggings are a must, dresses are also nice if that's what you like. For shoes,pick out something comfortable that you like but, boots with little heels and comfortable flats are best. Belts too- be sure to wear one with are the best pants that are a bit large, as you don't want them to fall down! If you are supposed to wear a uniform, remember that everyone does. Even if you can't dress cool for school, dress cool for parties and gatherings where it is permitted.

, Brush your teeth twice a day, shower once a day, use perfume if you like (""Bayla"" from Aeropostale is popular), use deodorant, brush your hair, and keep your body clean. If you like, grow your nails long and have a french manicure- or paint them a nice color.

, Wear a light coat of powder, blush, bronzer, eyeliner and mascara every day! Brown for brown eyes, navy for blue eyes, black for green and hazel. However, feel free to go without makeup if that's what you like and are happy with. Wash your face twice a day, use concealer on any imperfections if you feel the need to.

, Stand up for people being bullied. If you cuss or complain, only do so on occasion. Try not to, though.

, You can't please everyone and the need to please everyone can make other people dislike you. Being a good person and being smart about what you do is far better than running around after other people, ignoring them or being rude.

Realize that this is only middle school.",How to Be Popular in Middle School," One of the largest keys to being popular is to make people notice you and want to be around you. In order to do that, you have to put yourself out there. If you're always walking around the halls by yourself, dreading your next class, or frowning all the way through gym class, you won’t make a good impression and people will think that it’s a drag to be around you. The secret to making people want to be around you is to let them see you laughing and having a great time so they want to spend time with you too.When you’re hanging out with friends, make an extra effort and smile and have fun so people know you enjoy your time in school.
Even when you're alone in the halls, smile at people and give off a positive vibe so that people want to get to know you.;
, Having a pink mohawk or showing up to school in only your bathing suit will certainly make you stand out, but that may not be the kind of attention you want. To stand out in a good way, you have to let people know who you are and think positively of you when your name does come up. Here are some ways to get noticed:


You could be the guy who is always spotted with a guitar – and who actually knows how to play it.
You could have a really great laugh that people can hear from anywhere in the building.
You could stand out for your knockout sense of fashion. You could also rock a unique style, like looking like a hipster chick or a rocker guy, so that everyone knows who you are.
Maybe you have a really low, throaty voice that sounds completely unique. Whatever your quirks are, don't try to hide them. Remember that you want to be noticed for what makes you special.

, Joining a team and playing a sport is not only a great way to get some exercise and feel happier, but it’s also an excellent way to meet new people and make yourself known. You don’t have to be the star of your soccer team to play the sport, just have fun and get a great workout after school. Whether your school has a team or you’re playing an intramural league, make an effort to play at least one sport so you’ll be more likely to meet a variety of interesting people.


You may not end up liking the sport or sticking to it. But if you spend at least a year of middle school pursuing a sport, you’ll be more likely to make friends and open up your social circle.
Playing a sport also teaches you teamwork and how to deal with a variety of different talents and personalities, which can also help you manage people in your daily life and gain the skills that can help you become more popular.

, Joining clubs will also help you meet people, put yourself out there, and become a more interesting person as you pursue your interests. Pick something you really care about, like debate, French, Model UN, or a variety of other subjects, and stick to it. Become a leader in the club and use your position to improve the club and to get to know a wide variety of people.


Don’t think it’s uncool or nerdy to join a club. You’re just getting a leg up on the people who will be joining clubs in high school when they realize it is cool to be involved.
Joining a club and playing a sport, if you have time for it, will be a great way to meet an even larger variety of people. You may not meet the same people in clubs that you’ll meet on your sports team.

, The more things you do, the more people you know. And the more people you know, the more likely you are to get noticed and for people not to have a blank look on their faces when your name comes up. You should play soccer, be in the drama club, and be a student aide in the library – do whatever you find interesting and use your position to meet new people.


If you only pursue one interest, you’ll only be surrounded by one type of person. The key to truly being popular is being able to please a variety of different people.

, You may think it’s not cool to participate or even talk at all in class, and that you’re better off hanging out in the back of the room, looking like you have something better to do. Instead, you should participate in class, and do your homework so you actually look like you know what you’re talking about. You don’t have to be the teacher’s pet or anything, but you should talk enough so that all of the students in the class know who you are and like what you’re saying.


Make sure you don’t come off like a know-it-all when you speak. Be respectful and open-minded when you answer the teacher.

, If you want to be popular, then you have to work on being social, even if you’re on the shy side. You don’t have to give yourself a personality makeover to learn to be friendly to everyone, even if you don’t think that person can help your social status. The worst thing you can be is a social climber who has a reputation for only talking to the people who will make him look more popular. Instead, take the time to be friendly to anyone who comes in your path – it’ll pay off later.


Any time you see someone you know and they don't seem busy, say hi and give that person a big smile or a wave. You don’t have to have a ton in common to be nice to someone.
It’s not cool to be a jerk to someone like the girls on “Mean Girls.” That look may work in a movie, but you’ll get burned long-term if you have a nasty attitude.

Treat people with kindness and respect. Be nice to people and do them favors “just because,” not because you think it’ll make them invite you to their birthday parties.

, If you really want to be popular, then you have to show that you actually care about people, beyond whether or not they like you. You should show an interest in people by taking the time to be friendly, to ask your friends and acquaintances how they’re doing, and to ask them about their interests, families, and goals outside of school.


When you’re talking to people, make sure you ask questions like, “Are you having a good day?” or “Do you have any fun plans for this weekend?” so they know that you actually care about what goes on in their lives.
Work on listening just as much as you talk. If you spend all of your time talking about yourself and all of the cool things you’ve been up to, people will quickly lose interest.
You should also ask people their opinions on a variety of subjects, from the cookies in the school cafeteria to which club you should join. Asking for an opinion shows that you care and value their opinion.

, If you really want to be popular in middle school, then you should be able to make friends with not only the popular kids, but all of the rest of the kids in the school. If you only talk to the same eight people because you think that makes you cool, then you’ll be in trouble in high school, when your new school will be flooded with new people and you barely know a handful of them. Work on being friends with everyone – to the nice girl in your homeroom to the boy whose locker is next to yours.


You don’t have to be best friends with everyone, but you should seek out the people who interest you and who can teach you something without being too obvious about it.

, There’s nothing small about small talk. Being a master of small talk can help you talk to people and make them feel comfortable before you have a more deep or more fun conversation. To make small talk, just go up to a person, say hi, and start talking about how your days are going. Asking small questions can help lead to a bigger conversation and can make people open up to you. Here are some things you can say if you’re making small talk:


“Did you see World War Z? I thought it was nuts – what did you think?”
“Can you believe how hard that Algebra test was? I spent all weekend studying and still didn’t get half the questions right. How about you – did you do anything more fun than that this weekend?”
“How was your big game? I’m sorry I missed it.”
Make sure to ask questions that can’t just be answered with a simple “yes” or “no,” but which give the person room to elaborate. If they can answer the question in one word, it might stop right there and you'll be left wondering what to say.

, Making people laugh is a key part of being social and of making yourself more popular. If you feel comfortable being the class clown, go for it. If you’d rather impress people with your sharp wit, that’s great too. And if you’re great at teasing people and making them crack up, then that can be your thing. Don’t force humor on people, but work on maximizing your strengths when it comes to making people laugh.


Notice when people laugh the most when you talk to them. Make a mental note of what you did to make them laugh and try something similar again later.

, Learning to laugh at yourself is an important part of being a fun and social human being and of being more popular. People think that the popular kids think they’re perfect and that they can do no wrong, but it will actually be refreshing if people think that you’re cool without taking yourself too seriously. You don’t have to put yourself down or be insecure to learn to laugh at yourself, but you should joke around about your weaknesses and worries to show people that you’re comfortable with who you are.


Nobody’s perfect. If people see that you can poke fun at yourself during an ordinary conversation, they’ll appreciate you even more.
If you can’t laugh at yourself and are so sensitive that you can’t even take jokes when other people tease you, then people will assume that you’re no fun. And no one wants to be friends with a dud.

, You don’t have to be a girl who layers on the makeup or a guy who wears the trendiest shoes or pair of jeans just to be popular and get attention. But you should pay attention to your looks so that your clothes and body are clean, that your face isn't oily, and that people get a positive impression just by looking at you. You'll feel better about yourself if you know you look good, too.


Girls shouldn't wear makeup just because that’s what their friends are doing if that’s not really what they want to do. Natural beauty is far more impressive than beauty that's concocted with eye shadow and lip gloss.

, Though you can’t become confident overnight, you can make an effort to become more confident – to be happy with who you are, what you do, and how you look. Work on thinking about your best qualities instead of focusing on your worst attributes, and walk into a room like you’re happy to be there and deserve to be there. You can fake it until you make it. Even if you're not feeling confident, just acting confident will go a long way in making people respect you.Have confident body language. Stand tall, keep your shoulders out instead of hunching over, and look straight ahead instead of staring at the floor.
Make eye contact when you talk to people. This will show them that you’re not afraid of social interaction.
Don't put yourself down. Being self-deprecating just to get attention or just for something to talk about will make other people think that you don't value yourself.

, If you want to get noticed, then you have to be original in some way, whether it’s for your unique look or your unique perspective on life. You don't have to ""be weird"" or do something that doesn’t make you comfortable to be different. Just embrace your quirks and the thoughts and actions that make you special. People will notice you if you’re committed to being an individual instead of following the pack.


Don't dress like everyone else just to fit in. Find a style that suits your personality.
You don’t have to like the same music as everyone else to be popular, either. You'll be more respected if you take the time to find music that you really appreciate and share it with others.
Don't be afraid to voice your opinion in class even if it doesn't fit in with what everyone else is thinking. Your unique mind will make people notice you.

, Another way to easily get noticed for being awesome and to feel good about yourself is to excel in something, whether it’s being the most insightful girl in your English class, to being the best goalie your middle school has ever seen. Don't think that it's ""not cool"" to actually care about something, and instead, embrace the things you love and work hard to excel at them. It'll pay off in the future.


Being good at something will not only make people notice you, but it will build your character.
If you immerse yourself in something that you really care about, you'll be less likely to care what people think, and more likely to make new friends in the process.
Excelling at something will also make you a more dynamic person and more fun to talk to, so people will like you even more if you can talk about something that you love doing – as long as you don't brag.

, It may feel nearly impossible to stop caring what people think in middle school, when many people spend the majority of their time talking and gossiping about other people and worrying about how they come off. It’s only natural to care what people think when you're still growing, both physically and emotionally, as a person and don’t yet know quite where you belong.


If you recognize that you're not the only person who is feeling insecure or wondering what everyone thinks of you, you’ll be much less likely to care.
Focus on doing the things that make you happy instead of worrying about whether or not people will laugh at you for doing them!
If you spend your life doing whatever you think will make other people like you more, you'll never be satisfied.
When you walk into a room, stand tall and proud instead of checking your reflection every two seconds, fidgeting with your clothes, and wondering what people think of your appearance.

, Your popularity doesn't matter to anyone once you reach high school. Actually, people will dislike you the more popular you are from high school on due to the stereotypical actions of ""popular people."" The fame only lasts until 8th grade, so don't let it bother you. Just be nice and have friends that matter. What's the point of being that person who is so popular but no one likes? It's just middle school, popularity is the easiest of your future conflicts.

In fact, there's a lot of research out there that says it's the unpopular kids in middle school that are the successful adults. If you don't consider yourself popular, realize that it's only going to get better from here – while the rest of the popular kids you know are already at their peak."

Keep your grades up.,

Follow your school dress code.,
Don’t do drugs.,
Don’t tolerate bullying.",How to Be Popular in Middle School (for Girls)," Say “Hi!” to the person who sits next to you in class. Sit with somebody new at lunch. As you get to know them, ask them how they’re doing or what’s new in their life. Always treat others the way you want to be treated. Be friendly to everyone you meet—even the unpopular kids., Pretending in order to make a fake you believable is exhausting because you have to be constantly on your guard. Be yourself to attract people you can actually talk to. You’ll never have to question whether these people genuinely like you. Being real could include:Not following trends just because everyone else thinks they're cool. Platform shoes might be all the rage, but you know you'd fall on your face if you tried to walk in them.

, This will allow you to call (and text) each other. Communicating by phone is an easy way to build relationships. You don’t need your own cell phone to do this. You won’t be “uncool” if you still use a landline phone.If you don’t have a phone in your room or if your parents won’t let you have a cell phone, ask them if you can have an hour or so of phone time each day. Offer to show them a finished homework assignment in exchange for this privilege.
Don’t obsessively call or text your new friends. Take it slow. You don’t want to come off as someone who only cares about how many friends they have.

, This will allow you to chat with your friends outside of school. Share pictures, funny videos, and interesting websites. Chances are, you’ll expand your social circle when friends of your friends follow you.


Stay safe online. Don’t chat with people you don’t know and avoid being a cyberbully.
If your parents won’t allow you to have a social media account, understand they’re only looking out for you. Find newspaper articles on the benefits of social media and show them to your parents. If you can’t convince them, respect their wishes., Don’t forget them, even if they’re unpopular. They’ve been there for you from the start. You can always be yourself around them. If the popular kids won’t accept them in your life, you should re-evaluate if popularity is worth it., Look for things around your school that you want to improve. Ask your classmates what they think your school could do to make life better for students or the community. Pick the top three things that you can do as a middle school student and make that your campaign platform. Your candidacy and your willingness to listen to your peers will gain you visibility and popularity points., Make a list of what you excel at and take advantage of opportunities to show it off to your peers. Sharing your talents might attract classmates with common interests. If you’re really good, your talent could also get you recognized as a leader.You could:


Enter school talent shows.
Join a sports team.
Write for the school newspaper, if you have one.
Volunteer as a peer tutor.

, Get involved in school spirit days, sports matches, and other fun activities. These events often happen outside of regular school hours. They’ll give you the chance to get to know your classmates in a more relaxed environment. You’ll also have the chance to show your pride in your school and in your classmates., If “nothing” ever happens at or after school, plan something. Recruit a few friends to pitch your ideas for a school activity or a new club to your teacher, principal, or parent-teacher organization. Always ask your friends for their input. This will show them that their opinions matter to you. Some good ideas are:Starting a recycling program if your school doesn't have one already. If it does, make recycling fun by having a competition between grades or homerooms. The class that recycles the most pounds/kilograms of material in a month wins a pizza party.
Holding a career week. Invite parents, older siblings, and community leaders to discuss their careers with students. If you get enough speakers, try highlighting a different career field each day.

, Even when you’re attracting a lot of attention from others, you still need to do well in school. It’s not cool to skip school, neglect your homework, and/or receive F’s on assignments. Good grades might help to win you the admiration of even more people.


Share your success by organizing study groups. It will show them that you care about how well your classmates do. As a bonus, you'll have the chance to get to know them better.

, If you disagree with something, don’t pretend to go along with it because everybody else does. Tell them you disagree. Do this in a pleasant way without upsetting others. People are more likely to consider your ideas if you speak with conviction and show that you’ve thought things through carefully. You could say:“I’m not trying to say you’re wrong, but I’m just not into that kind of thing.”
“But that’s not the only way of looking at it. Have you considered…?”

, If you don’t have to wear a uniform, you probably still can’t wear street clothes that fall out of school guidelines. Don’t try to disobey these rules. Your school board put them in place for your own good. If fashion is important at your school, read up on ways to be stylish without breaking the dress code. Setting a new trend could earn you some leadership points, which is good for any popular person.

, This includes alcohol and cigarettes. Drugs won’t make you more popular. They’re more likely to give you a bad reputation. Remember, you’re not an adult yet. Doing drugs will stunt your physical and mental growth. It will also ruin your appearance. If you don’t want to be confrontational to anyone who offers you drugs, you could say something like, “No thanks. It's not my style.”, Say something when you see an unpopular kid getting teased or tormented. If you believe you’d be in danger for stepping up, tell a teacher or other school authority about the situation. This will show others that you have the confidence to do the right thing. It will also show that you're concerned about your classmates."

You don't need to be with the popular crowd.,
On the internet, use current internet slang.,
Most importantly, just relax and be yourself.",How to Be Successful in Middle School (Girls)," Even though what clothes you wear shouldn't influence how people see you, the truth is, it does. Dress appropriately. For example, avoid wearing low tank tops, and instead, maybe a t-shirt. It doesn't have to be from an expensive brand or a designer outfit, but just enough to show others your unique personality or style.;
, Shower every day, if possible, and wash your hair, at least, every other day. Don't use perfume, but if you want you can use a body spray (such as one from Bath and Body Works, Victoria's Secret, or Gap Body). Deodorant is a must. Secret Scent Expressions is a good, long-lasting deodorant. Brush your teeth twice a day and keep gum or mints on you. If you don't like mints, chocolate-covered Altoids might work.

, If you want, you can buy a straightening iron and use it to every other day. (This might damage your hair). Always use a spray-on heat protectant. If your hair begins to look damaged, i.e. dry and brittle, deep-condition with a leave-in conditioner. When you wash your hair, first take some shampoo and scrub it vigorously into your scalp to clean off the oil. Rinse off the shampoo. Squeeze the water out of your hair, and apply conditioner below your ears only. Let it sit for a minute or two (now is a good time to soap up) and rinse it out last of all.


For short-haired girls, a headband or a short ponytail is a cute style. Don't wear short pigtails, it'll look like you're trying too hard. If you have really short hair, put gel in it if you want to, or let it go natural.
For medium- to long-haired girls, headbands, ponytails, messy buns, braids, and pigtails are good.

, In fact, it's perfectly acceptable to wear no makeup at all in middle school. If you do, make it look as natural as possible. This means smudged eyeliner and heavy black mascara are epic NO's. If you want, go with some natural-looking lip gloss (C.O. Bigelow Mentha Lip Tint by Bath and Body Works, CoverGirl Wetslicks, Maybelline Shinesensational, Burt's Bee's Lip Shimmers, etc). Wash your face every morning (soap and warm water) and if you want use a light moisturizer. Exfoliants are not necessary in middle school, and can actually damage skin.

, Here is the tricky part. You need to balance being cool with not being a follower. Mix-and-match clothes from the following brands:


Preppy brands. These are the currently popular clothing labels, it's a good idea to get one or two shirts or sweatshirts from these labels, just so you have something popular to wear: American Eagle Outfitters, Aeropostale, Hollister, Abercrombie and Fitch.
Cool brands for casual wear. This is where you really start to mix-and-match. Jeans, floral tops, jewelry, cardigans, jackets, belts--it's all up to you what to buy: Forever 21, BB Dakota (pricey, but the Jack BB Dakota jackets are amazing quality), H&M, Love Culture.

, The following stores have great finds, sometimes even designer labels for much less: Marshall's, TJ Maxx, Walmart, Nordstrom Rack, JCPenney's. Never overlook Amazon.com for jackets, either. All you need is a pair of skinny jeans, a pair of boot cut jeans, a couple cute T's, a sweatshirt/cardigan/jacket of some kind, and spring/summer wear.

, Currently, Converse All-Star chucks, Doc Martens, and Vans skate shoes are in style. Vans are pretty affordable, starting at $45, and Converse can be found for as low as $30. If that's too pricey, go with some Airwalks from Payless. They have chucks too for much less. Any pair of cool-looking sneakers works fine. UGGs are in style, but so many people have fake UGGs that buying a pair from Target or any department store works fine too. Flip-flops are a must-have and can be purchased from any store. If you want a name brand, American Eagle has aerie flip-flops with the logo for less than $10 in the summer. If you want cool socks (hey, if you change for PE, you might want them!), colorful KB socks are in style, and here's where you're in luck: you can get them from Costco for really cheap!

, People like a cheerful, friendly, accepting girl. Don't judge other people, don't swear, always be positive and don't talk trash about other girls behind their backs. Truly popular girls are really nice to everyone, including school outcasts, and they make friends easily. Be loyal and interested in your friends' lives. Don't hog conversations. Let other people take the lead sometimes, and don't mope around or get depressed because things aren't going well. Remember, you can always fix it. If you need help, talk to an older sibling, cousin, or friend, or your parent, aunt, uncle, church youth leader, etc.

, Very few truly popular girls fail school. You don't need to be a nerd (although there's nothing wrong with that!), but aim for at least all As and get A+'s in the subjects you know you're good at. Remember, your grades are much more important than how popular you are. Write your homework in your planner (if that's boring or considered uncool, use colored gel pens and highlighters to make it more interesting!) and set an estimated time frame. When you get home, make a schedule that includes time for showering, eating, practicing instruments, and playing on the computer. Stick to your schedule and turn in all your homework.


If Facebook and IM are distractions, don't try to completely cut them out of your schedule. Your self-control will lapse and you'll end up spending hours on those sites anyway. Instead, give yourself a half hour of time each day BEFORE you start work. This way, you'll get the urge out of your way without spending too long online.
If you need homework help and don't want to ask friends or parents, check to see if your local library or school offers tutoring. Many times high school students will tutor for free in order to get community service hours. Check online too, if you need math or science help there are a host of good websites.

, If you like being active, take up a sport. If you like music, learn an instrument in your school band or orchestra, and take private lessons if you can. Singing in the choir is great too. Many schools have honors choirs, jazz bands, symphony orchestras, etc. Here are some activities to look into: yearbook club, French club, politics club, service club, select/premier soccer, basketball, etc., fencing, crew, horseback riding, softball, swim team, debate, knowledge bowl, math club, science olympiad, football, hockey, ping-pong, manga club, art club, D&D club, culture club, Chinese/Japanese/German school (even if you're not that ethnicity!), guitar club, Future Problem Solvers club. In all these activities you're sure to meet people like you.

, Abide by the ""rule of eights""--get eight hours of sleep (nine is even better!), drink eight glasses of water a day, get eight servings of fruits and vegetables (it seems excessive, but it will really pay off). Take a multivitamin if you want. Remember, it's okay to get ridiculously high amounts of certain vitamins, especially C--even up to 500%! If you want a great-tasting supplement, Nordic Berries are like gummies. Cod liver oil sounds disgusting, but it's great for getting healthy Omega-3 fatty acids, which make your eyesight better, improve your memory and brain power, and contribute to healthy nails, skin, and hair. Nordic Naturals' strawberry DHA chews taste terrific.

, Almost everyone has a cell phone and/or iPod these days. If you don't have a cell phone or iPod, don't stress!


If you don't have a phone because your parents won't let you get one, all is not lost. Offer to pay for the minutes yourself. Show them phones such as the LG Neon which are cool-looking but don't cost much. If the answer is still ""no"" and you've tried every argument (""Times have changed since you were a teen!"" and ""I need it to stay in contact with you!""), don't panic. You can keep in touch with friends via Facebook, call with a home phone (use a cordless phone if you have one to talk privately), and text with an iPod touch (see below) or with your email (Google how).
If you can't afford an iPod, Sansa, Sony, Ematic, and Coby MP3 players offer great value for less. Get a 2GB one at a minimum, although 4 to 8GB is ideal.
If you have an Apple iPod touch, here's how to text with one:
Download TextNow from the app store. It's a dollar. With this alone, you can text your friends unlimited whenever you have wi-fi. This is great already, but don't you hate how you can only use an email address for your friends to text you?
Go to voice.google.com and register for an invite. Once you receive it (it should take 2-4 weeks), get a Google phone number. Follow instructions on the enflick.com site to link your GV number to your TextNow address. Then give that number to your friends and voila, you've got an ordinary phone number!
To take this concept further, set up your GV number to ring your home phone. BUT, since a parent might pick up a call meant for you, record a custom voicemail greeting, then go to your GV account settings and set your account to automatically forward to voicemail. This way your phone will never ring, but your friends can leave a voicemail message, which you can listen to and respond to!

, Listen to Top 40 music and pick some you like to download. Otherwise, just learn the popular music so you know it when other people sing it. It's a good idea to have some popular music on your MP3 player for some occasions. Then again, don't be a conformist! Jazz, soundtracks, indie, and classical music are always okay.


Here are some popular artists to look into: Lady Gaga, The Weekend, Chainsmokers, Train, Ke$ha, Jay Sean, Jay-Z, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, T-Pain, Iyaz, Cher Lloyd, Lana Del Rey, Ed Sheeran, Olly Murs or One Direction.
If you want to discover great music, Pandora is a good option.
For a dance playlist, the following songs are must-haves: One Dance, Work, Cheap Thrills,Work From Home, This is What you Came For, Can't Stop the Feeling, Roses, and Sucker for Pain. Listen to these songs so you can sing along at dances and socials. Other popular artists are Taylor Swift, Twenty One Pilots, My Chemical Romance, Panic! At the Disco, Coldplay, Adele, Jason Derulo, Drake, Beyonce, and Zayn.

, You should watch/read one of these famous series: the Divergent series, the Harry Potter series, the Twilight Saga, and the Hunger Games Trilogy.

, You don't need to be in a relationship, even if everyone else is in one. Think of it this way: when you go out with someone, one of two things is going to happen: you'll get married, or you'll break up. The first isn't happening anytime soon. So you're probably destined for breakup, not to be negative, but to be realistic. Wait for awhile. Eighth grade is okay to have a boyfriend/girlfriend in, but ideally, wait for high school. It's nice to feel loved, but having close friends (boy and girl friends!) is really important.

, Check your Instagram, Snapchat, texts, and email, at least, weekly. Read Seventeen magazine, or go online to stay updated on the latest news. If you don't have cable TV go to hulu.com. Yahoo! Answers is a great place to ask questions about middle school.

, Get your own circle of close friends, don't make enemies.

, But don't use them too much, because then it's hard to figure out what you're trying to say. A little is fine though.

, You gotta like yourself for other people to like you!

Keep the friends you have now, but go out of your way to talk to everyone, including the popular kids. The real definition of popular is knowing a lot of people. Make friends in all kinds of social groups.;
, Do social things like go to parties, sleepovers, and sporting games for your middle school. It's easy to hang out with one or two people all the time and cling to one best friend, but try to spend time with different people too. Hanging out outside of school might be awkward at first but you'll be surprised at how good of friends you can become with them over time!

, People would much rather prefer to see someone with a little acne than someone with foundation caked all over their face. If you're still in middle school, the only make up you should really wear is a bit of cover up if you have a blemish, some mascara, a tiny bit of eye liner on your upper lash line, and maybe a light pink blush. Play around with it an find different ways that you like to wear it.

, There are so many places where you can get clothes for less like Ross, TJ Maxx, Forever 21, and Plato's Closet. If you have a little bit of time on your hands and have a lot of patience, you can even try Goodwill or other thrift stores. It might sound scary at first because you picture old ladies digging through old piles of clothes, but it's really not! Sure you have to dig through a lot of clothes from the 80's and 90's, but there are times when you can find something really cute for only a few dollars!

, Again, if you don't have a lot of money, you can find ones on Craigslist if your parents will drive with you to go get it. Sometimes people switch carriers a month or so after buying a phone and will sell theirs for cheaper than what they bought it for!

, You never know what could happen!

, You don't have to wear what everyone else is wearing or follow every trend. Mix and match your old clothes with newer ones for your own spin on things.

, Most girls in Middle School have an Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat, Oovoo or various other social networks.. See what's trending! What is the app that everyone uses?

, It does not matter how nerdy the person is. The more people you have that consider you a friend, the better.

, This will keep your face looking fresh and pimple free. If that isn't enough, you can find spot treatments and other things at a drugstore to help with acne.

, Curly, in a ponytail, straight, pinned up, wavy, etc. Make sure you don't put heat on your hair everyday and that you have a good heat protectant. Look up no-heat routines on YouTube!

, Everybody looks up to smart people, and they'll pay off later! If you need help in class, it's okay to ask your teacher for help after class. Also, be good in class! Nobody likes the loud, interruptive person the teacher always has to yell at.

, When people think of popularity and friendship, they tend to think that you need a friend who has pretty hair, is rich, and is perfect. Remember no one is perfect, every person has flaws. If you spend your time with someone like this, you will end up feeling jealous and will spend your time trying to impress them, which won't be fun for you. Find someone who likes the same things as you, that you can hang out at home with and just watch movies in your pajamas!

, If there's a person in your class who is being mean to you, ignore them and tell an adult. Don't take it personally when they say it. If somebody calls you stupid, ignore them call a teacher or parent. Don't give them the time of day!

, You could be a cheerleader, artist, dancer, whatever your school has to offer. You can meet new friends in clubs and sports!

, You could be the ultimate perfect Middle School girl! You can increase your chances by attending Student Council.

, Smile as you can and remember to do it genuinely. When posing for pictures, think of something funny to give you a natural smile and help you smile with your eyes. Do not pout or make duck lips.

, Cussing might make others think that you're an unintelligent, immature person and would most likely ignore you. If if slips out, that can count as an ""oops!"" moment, but don't make it a habit.

, Don't be too sarcastic when you joke around, as some people may find this offensive. If someone jokes about that you don't take yourself too seriously and people will admire that

,, It's so easy for girls to just throw things on their floor and have a messy room but having friends over, especially new ones, feels so much better when you have a clean room. If your room has been the same for a long time, switch things out. If you can, paint your walls a light shade of your favorite color that you know you won't get tired of in a long time. Get new bedding or some throw pillows. Donate old stuffed animals or childish decorations. Hang pictures of you and your friends up on the walls. Display your favorite things that you know will make you happy. Change the layout of your room. Don't forget to express your personality throughout your room.

, This can make learning a lot more fun. I know that taking notes is so much better when it's with a cute pen and notebook.

, No, not duck face pictures of you in your room. Not pictures in the reflection of you and your friends in a bathroom mirror. Actual pictures. Have your mom take one of you and your friends during a sleepover, on the first day of school, on your birthday. When you are older it will be so nice to have actual pictures to look back on. No one wants to have to show their kids pictures of them and friends posing in a mirror.

, Shower daily, use a moisturizer, deodorant, a little bit of perfume, brush and floss your teeth well. Nothing turns people off to someone more than a bad odor

, It's nice to have to offer to friends or even someone who sits next to you that you don't know.

, This can be one of the first things people notice about you. You don't have to get manicures or have them painted all of the time, but keep them clean, shaped, and over all nice looking. If you want to use bright nail polish, painting your toes with it can be a better idea than painting your finger nails lime green. Stick to shades like red, pink, nude, champagne.

, If not, remind yourself it's not the end of your world.

, You will make mistakes and you will learn from them, but hopefully this article will make your life easier.

, Yes, it may sound cheesy but it's true! Nobody likes someone who isn't true to themselves. Everyone is already taken, there is only one you. You wouldn't want 4 of you, do you?!

Update your personal appearance.,
Take good care of your hair.,
Develop a personal style.,
Wear makeup (if you already wear makeup).,
Control your attitude.,
Join a diverse amount of groups.,
Get good grades.",How to Be Popular Without Anyone Hating You," You can look beautiful enough without having to intimidate people or confirm to wearing short or tight clothes, as they say, ""Modest is hottest."" Try to step out of the stereotypical popular girl look, and make an attempt to not dress like your friends. Instead, find your own fashion statement. You can do this by finding clothes that you are comfortable with and help you to bring out the character within you. Remember that the clothes you wear give people an impression about who you are and the type of person that you want to be.;
, If it's naturally greasy, wash it every day or every other day. If it's dry, wash it every two or three days, and be sure to use conditioner. If it's normal, wash it every other day, with a small bit of conditioner. Brush your hair after your shower, when you wake up, and when you go to bed. If you use heat on your hair, don't do it too often, as it will damage your hair. Try doing something pretty with your hair everyday so it shows that you take care of yourself.

, Try to make it unique and just for you, but make it fit in a little. If someone copies your style, it may be annoying, but this just means they like you and see you as a role model. People follow the popular people's style, right?

, Makeup isn't to cover up your flaws, it's to outline your best features. If you love your smile, wear lip gloss or lipstick. If you have amazing eyes, wear mascara and eye shadow. Maybe wear some powder or foundation to get smooth skin. People will start to notice how beautiful you are.

, Be nice to everyone, even the mean girls, and people will notice you. If you're mean to people, they'll be mean to you. You can be popular and not be friends with the ""populars"". Make friends with everyone!

, Don't just try out for cheerleading or soccer, instead, try to supplement your activities with what interests you. This could be joining a chess club or a marching band.

, Good grades are the most important thing in school. Sure, being popular is fun, but without good grades, you'll fail in the future.

Take up a hobby.",How to Be Noticed in Middle School," Having a distinct style is the easiest way to stand out. There are several of styles to choose from. You could be preppy, hipster, goth, etc. Your personal style is an expression of your character. Be sure it is a style you really like before committing to it. Keep in mind that you should still follow your school’s dress code, especially if your school requires a uniform..


Preppy, hipster, and Goth are a few suggestions for style, but your personal style can be anything that appeals to you, even if it doesn’t have a title. Look to the music you listen to, the movies you watch, and the books you read for style inspiration. You can model your style after a person or character you admire.
A preppy style is a classic and clean style that derives from Ivy League collegiate fashion. Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and Lacoste are a few brands known for being preppy. Collared shirts, sweaters, and chinos are popular for preppy men. Opaque tights, girly blouses, and thin sweaters are popular for womenHipster style has become very popular in recent years. It is very different from preppy style. It is an often ironic style that values non-mainstream style and interests. Flannel shirts, band t-shirts, Doc Martens, and beanies are associated with hipster style.Goth style began in the 1980s by rebellious youths with a unique and often darker view of the world. Goth style is characterized by black or brightly colored hair, dark makeup, black clothing, and large boots.;
, Choose a hairstyle that fits in with the style you would like to adhere to. For preppy style, consider short, gelled hair for men and long straight hair for women. Hipster guys often have their hair cut short on the sides and wear it long on top. The ladies have a broad range of hairstyles from short pixie cuts to long, beach waves. Goths often like to dye their hair black or brightly colored. These are a few options for hairstyles, but there are many choices. Experiment and choose what makes you feel the best about yourself.You can also tease your hair if you associate with Goth style.
Your hair doesn’t specifically have to be associated with your clothing style. You can also choose unique hair styles like braids, very short hair, or very long hair.
Temporary henna dye is also an option if you want to change the color of your hair, but ask your parents first.

, Clothing is the best and most obvious way to show off your personal style. You may need to buy new clothing if your current wardrobe doesn’t work with the style you desire to have. Look through the clothes you own to determine which items of clothing work for your preppy, hipster, Goth style, or other style of your choice. Then, buy new shoes, pants, shirts, sweaters, skirts, and/or dresses that are appropriate for the current season.You don’t have to buy a new wardrobe at once. Buy a few items of clothing at a time that you can wear for the current season. Don’t buy clothes for winter until winter weather gets near.
Buying new clothes can be costly. Save up your allowance. Offer to do odd jobs for friends, family, and/or neighbors. You can also talk with your parents to see if they would be willing to buy new clothes for you.
It’s not necessary to buy all new and expensive clothing. Buy from thrift shops or during big sales.

, Accessorizing has a few different functions. It can help you achieve the style you desire, even if the clothes don’t fall into that style. Wearing accessories can also draw attention to the parts of yourself that you want people to notice. Earrings, necklaces, belts, bracelets, hairbands, and scarves are some examples of accessories. If you attend a school that requires a uniform, accessories can be a way to make your personal style known.A great accessory can be a conversation starter. For example, wearing a necklace that has something to do with your favorite book can draw attention from another fan of the book.
A few preppy accessories for women would be pastel headbands, pearl earrings, tennis bracelets, and monogrammed purses. For men, argyle socks, ties, and leather and canvas belts work.Hipster style accessories can be very broad. A few examples are scrunchies, bowl hats, bow ties, fanny packs, and rimmed glasses.A few Goth accessories are chokers, studded belts and bracelets, jewelry with pentagrams, and purses or bags with skulls on them., It’s okay and normal to be shy. Sometimes, starting a conversation with a fellow student can seem intimidating. Keep in mind that many people feel the same way. You can start a conversation by simply saying “Hello! How are you doing today?” Remember, it’s not your problem if the other person does not respond nicely.


If it is a classmate, ask about an upcoming project or test.
Talk to another student about an upcoming school event.

, Bullying and meanness is common in middle school, but you do not want to get noticed for being unkind to others. Instead, show compassion and kindness whenever possible. Stand up for the people that get bullied. Help the girl that drops her books in the hallway. Talk to the people that seem shy and don’t have many friends. It is better to be noticed for your positive actions and traits., Humor is infectious, and people are drawn to people with a good sense of humor. There is a difference between having a sense of humor and being funny. Being funny means telling jokes, great stories, and finding what is funny about every situation. Having a sense of humor means not taking everything too seriously and having the ability to let things go. Strive for both.


Think about your sense of humor. What makes you laugh? You might have a silly, dry, or dark sense of humor.
Learn jokes by researching them on the internet and watching comedy shows.
Be careful to not be offensive or disruptive with your jokes. You should say anything that will hurt another person’s feelings or get you in trouble in class.

, Confidence is often difficult to achieve during your middle school years. Don’t worry if you don’t feel confident. Many people in your age group do not. You can, however, work on your confidence by acting like you are. People respond positively to confident people, and it is a way to stand out in the crowd. You can build your confidence by having positive expectations, recognizing your talents, and appearing confident.Don’t expect to fail or for others not to like you. Expect to be successful and liked. You can’t control what happens, but positive expectations make positive outcomes more likely.
Everyone is good at something. Recognize your strengths. You might be kind, loyal, and good at avoiding confrontation. You may also be good at running, computers, and acting.
You can appear confident by dressing the way you like, making eye contact, smiling, and having good posture.

, Helping others and setting a good example will make you stand out not just in middle school, but all throughout your life. You don’t have to be older than others students to be a good role model. You can be a good role model by utilizing your kindness and confidence and helping others whenever possible.Never treat anyone as any less than equal to you.
If you are good at a subject, like math, offer to help another student that is struggling in that subject.
Pick up messes when you see them. Offer to help teachers or students that are carrying too much. Actions get you noticed and make you a good role model.

, A good way to get noticed at school by your peers and teachers is to join a club. Joining a club or organization at your school is a way to get to know a diverse group of people, learn a skill that you can talk to people about, and get recognized in the yearbook. Becoming a part of a club will require you to spend more time at school, which will make you more recognizable.The yearbook club is a great club to become a part of because you work with others, take pictures of students, and talk with students and teachers.
Choose a club based on your interests. You will meet other people like you and learn skills that you can carry with you throughout your education. Some clubs to consider are the tech club, art club, world language club, and the band or choir., Joining a team is a great way to meet other people and get recognized as a member of that team around school. Becoming a part of a team usually requires a tryout. If you get a spot on team, you will need to commit to practices, games, or shows. Teams usually require more dedication than a club. So choose a team that you are genuinely interested in.If you are interested in sports, consider the football, basketball, lacrosse, or soccer team. Check what sports teams your school has.
If you are interested in academics, consider becoming a part of the debate, math, or chess team.

, Taking part in many or all events that your school offers is way to get recognized. The type of events offered depends on your school. Many middle schools, however, will hold dances, holiday events, concerts by the band and choir, and sometimes festivals for the beginning/end of the school year. Attend as many events as possible.Go to the event with a friend if you don’t want to attend the event alone.
Try to start conversation with other people attending about the event.

, Try out a hobby that you can practice outside of school. Often, if you work hard at the hobby, you will be known as the girl or boy that is really good at or into whatever the hobby may be. You may already have a hobby you enjoy, but if not, there are many hobbies to choose from. Becoming invested in a hobby is also a great way to meet others with similar interests.Try making jewelry, like bracelets and earrings, and giving them out to people at school. You can buy supplies at your local craft store, like Michael’s or Hobby Lobby.
Some other hobbies to choose from are dance, cooking, painting, writing, films, and gaming.

Keep up on trends.,
Have a sense of humor.,
Don’t tell secrets.,
Get active.",How to Be Cool in Seventh Grade1," Being alone isn’t cool and neither is chasing the friendship of the people with the most status. Instead of trying to befriend the most attractive people, spend time with friends the same gender as you and don’t abandon them if you do make more friends. Good friendships make you feel more confident now and more healthy long-term.Instead of looking for relationships and trying to impress immature kids who seem cool, stay home with your friends. Find activities you can do together, even if that means watching a movie and eating ice cream.
Social media is good for maintaining friendships, but be sure to spend plenty of time in-person with friends.;
, Social media is a widespread, easy platform to use to connect to friends, but it creates many problems. It’s very easy to get wrapped up in negative activities such as cyberbullying. Stay connected with others, discuss interests, but don’t make a bad name for yourself by being rude.Take as much time off as you can from social media to spend time with friends or do activities.
Don’t try hard to impress others. You don’t need to compete to take wild pictures and post status updates. Instead, having fun and doing what comes naturally will come through in the pictures and on the page and make you seem confident and cool.
It’s easy to respond quickly and angrily online, but this opens you up for retaliation. Instead, turn off computer and calm down first.

, Have you heard that new song yet? Everyone else in school has, and to be cool it’s useful to be able to keep up with what everyone else knows. If you know about that song, for instance, even if you don’t like it you’ll be able to talk about it.


Having common ground with someone helps you begin a conversation and become their friend., If you struggle with being entertaining, you can learn some jokes, for instance, but humor also includes the way you look at your situation. In the seventh grade, any awkward moment or mistake can look like a big deal. If you treat it like one, others see that and may even joke about it. Learning to let life not bother you is part of maintaining your cool.


Remember that the things that look bad now won’t mean anything later on, so you’ll end up laughing about many of these memories anyway.

, It doesn’t matter how trustworthy you think someone is. In the seventh grade, if you do anything, whether that be planning a surprise for a friend or sending a naked picture of yourself, expect that the school will know. The other seventh graders feel the need to know and be first to tell others, and they will distort the message along the way. Don’t tell anything you don’t want to be public knowledge.This also goes for anything anyone else tells you. If someone tells you a secret, the last person you want to be is the one who can’t be trusted. Keep it secret. If it’s important, talk to a trusted adult.

, Athletes are commonly considered cool. Sports are school-wide activities that a limited group of students get to perform. You can however participate in these sports and teams outside of school. If you’re not athletically-inclined, getting active means finding something else you enjoy, like a school club or a youth group.


The important step to being active is finding something you enjoy. Make friends while doing it. You’ll become happier, more confident, and therefore appear cooler.
Give up on worrying a lot about what other people think of your activities.

",How to Be Popular in Middle School (for Boys)," It shouldn't be greasy. Also brush your teeth, smell good, and wash your face.;
, Middle school is a difficult time - you never know who is having a bad day. Just one smile can brighten someone else's day.

,, This is key to have people respecting you more. A confident attitude is about standing up straight, holding your head up and striding manly around school. Walk like it everyday and soon you'll feel more confident and you'll see that people will think of you with more respect, too.

, This is the the golden rule to be popular. You have to be yourself or people might avoid you. If the person you're trying to be friends with doesn't want to be friends with you, then it's their loss, not yours. Don't let anybody change you. If he/she doesn't like you for who you are, then move on to a different person.

, Nobody likes a liar and if you do lie then it's going to catch up to you in life. The truth might be embarrassing.

, It's so easy to be popular. All you have to do is say hi to everybody in your school or compliment others if you want to. Saying hi definitely breaks the ice. You can also compliment others, by saying things like: ""Hey dude, nice shoes. Are you a skater dude or something?"" He most likely will respond back - if he doesn't then find somebody else. Same goes with complimenting girls; don't say something like: ""Hey, I love your hair."" Or ""I really like your shirt today."" Treat her like a Guy. Say similar things. If she doesn't respond then move on. There are tons of boys and girls who like you. You just have to find the right people.

, During your conversations with people, try to find things you have in common. This will make your friendship last for a long time. Don't agree on everything; you're going to have one thing you like that he/she doesn't or something that he/she likes that you don't.

Be more social.",How to Be Cool and Popular in Sixth Grade," Remember, clothes don't have to be brand-name to be cool and make you look good. Some great stores to try are Aeropostale, Roxy, Old Navy, Forever 21, Hollister, A'GACI, Rue 21, American Eagle, River Island, Justice, Target, Burlington, Walmart, Brandy Melville, Tilly's and more. Remember to get clothes appropriate for your age. Don't copy anybody's fashion style because then people will think you're a wannabe or a poser, a fake kind of person. Here are some things to keep in mind as you find the perfect clothes for you. If your school has uniforms don't worry, just remember to accessorize.


It's okay if you mix clothes together and make things trendy in a unique, 'you'-kind-of-way to show off your own style while using just the tiniest bit of copying from someone else, like layering jewelry.






Also, if you have a uniform make sure you don't get massive baggy clothes that don't fit you properly. Slim fit is all the rage.
Skinny jeans are in style. But remember, super skinny jeans look great on some people, but not everyone. Boys should avoid skinny jeans unless they want to go for that particular look.






Distressed jeans are in and you can make your own! Get help from an older sibling or cousin who can help you not rip the holes straight across, but blend them. Before cutting up your jeans, you can practice on fabric, experimenting with fraying and cutting. Learn how to ""ladder"" jeans.






Sweaters! Cardigans are in style, as are lightweight v-neck sweaters with a tank top for girls.






Skinny jeans are cute with combat boots in the opinion of some. Be sure to get a few because they go well with almost everything.
Polo shirts aren't nerdy if you wear them right, so it all depends on how you look and how you wear them! Try a simple polo with skinny jeans and shoes like Converse or similar.
A plain polo in a basic color is nice. If you want to get a polo, though, get some from Ralph Lauren or Lacoste. Ralph Lauren is known for their polo shirts. If you can't afford polo shirts from these stores, Abercrombie, Hollister, Ardene and Aeropostale always have good ones. Polo shirts may not look good on girls that have breasts, and are often form fitting, showing where the top of your jeans may have a muffin top.






Hoodies are essential according to some. They go with almost everything! Make sure the hoodie is a good fit, but baggy and loose can also look cute with skinnies. Girls can wear a sweater and skirt combo.;
, Accessorizing is important, but don't overdo it. Long necklaces are cool. Earrings, studs, are good too. A big trend is mock Ray-ban 1 color sunglasses, which can be bought at Claire's or Icing. Wide brim hats and fedoras are always a good choice. If you go to a school that has uniforms, don't push the limit because you might get in trouble.


Get some new shoes. Some good choices are Heelys, Nike free-runs, Converse, Sperry's, Reeboks, and combat boots.







, Just use some lip balm or gloss, and some mascara, eye shadow (light ones work). Using thick eyeliner or foundation will make you look fake. A light amount on your skin can conceal zits or dark under eye circles. Some concealer has built in acne medicine. You can go natural sometimes, too. Make sure you ask your parents before starting to use makeup.


Many sixth grade girls don't wear makeup at all. That is absolutely fine. You shouldn't do anything you're not comfortable with and can wait until you're ready.







, Wash your face once in the morning and right when you are about to go to bed at night with a cleanser that's ideal for you.


If you end up with a pimple, do not squeeze it, because this can lead to a little dent in your skin called a pockmark that lasts years after the pimple is gone. There is a special tool for removing pimples and blackheads with a loop on the end.






Before doing this, or even washing your face you can fill the sink with warm water, put a towel over your head, and lean over the sink. The steam will open your pores, helping acne wash penetrate.






Try putting liquid cover-up on, and after it dries put some powder cover-up on. Washing your face more than twice a day will dry out your skin, making it scaly and flaky, and will cause more acne and then you'll have a bigger problem.







, Giving yourself manicures works as well. You can go to Target and get $2 nail polishes and inexpensive nail sticker sets. You should not use acrylics because they are clearly not your natural nails. Beauty schools can have trained students do manicures for $5 instead of $20. Also, you can go on to YouTube and learn how to do any design on your own.


Again, if manicures aren't your thing, you do not have to go out and get them.

, Brush your teeth twice a day, use mouthwash, and wash your hair as many times a week as it needs. Don't go crazy on the styling products. Look for a hair styling cream that comes in a tub, not a big squirt bottle if you are a boy. If you are a girl all you need is bobby pins, combs for your hair type, rubber bands, headbands, and a light hair spray. If you want a different hair type you can buy straightening or curling irons.


Greasy hair isn't exactly attractive, so be sure to wash it regularly!
Make sure that if you have braces you get clear bands! But with clear bands make sure you don't eat something that can stain them.

, Layered hair is in style, and straight hair as well. If you decide to curl your hair (which is in style as well) then ask for help if you're new at curling hair maybe your mom can help you out. Some girls will add a fun color streak in their hair. Side bangs are good too.

, Tote bags are stylish, but if you have a long way to walk, a backpack that goes on your back is the best choice. If you ride or walk to school you will need a backpack with two well-padded shoulders. In addition to a stronger structure, most backpacks come with water bottle holders and outer pockets, a thing most messenger bags do not have. Kipling backpacks are in.

, This is key if you want to be cool and popular. If people think you think they're important, they will want to spend time hanging out with you. If you seem like you're only obsessed with yourself, then no one will want to be around you. Here are some things to do if you want to make other people feel special:



Listen to what people are saying, and respond to let them know you were paying attention.






Ask people lots of questions to show them that you care.






Make the conversation about other people, not just yourself.
Don't brag.

, Being popular doesn't mean acting like you're in Mean Girls -- sure, that can get you some attention, but that kind of act can get old, fast. Instead, you should try to be nice to people without being fake, so that they feel welcome around you. Here are some things to keep in mind:



Avoid gossiping whenever you can, or you'll have a reputation as a gossip and no one will trust you.
Don't compete with other girls at school. It'll make you look desperate. If another kid wants to compete with you in popularity, dating, or style, say ""No. I don't need a contest to prove I am good.""

,
Be sympathetic and empathetic.


Compliment someone on their hair, clothes, shoes, backpack, etc.
Be respectful to everyone, including teachers, your friends, and other kids.
Be cheerful, natural, and outgoing.

, If you're a girl, don't show affection to a guy you like by being mean to other guys, or he'll become afraid and not want to ask you out. Also, do not play hard to get. It turns a boy off even though T.V. shows make it look like it turns him on.


You don't have to be nice to every person of the opposite gender but don't be mean to people you like because you think it's flirting, either.
If you're not ready to like people romantically or to try to date people, don't worry about it. You'll know when it's time, and there's no need to rush.

, When you feel alone and like you have no friends or maybe you do have friends but they're just not with you at the time, just say hello to someone. After a while of doing this and starting conversations with people, you'll have a lot of friends.


Try to talk to some popular people and maybe invite them to a party or just to hang out. Try not to look desperate to become popular while doing this.
Do not leave your old friends behind just to be popular.
Treat everyone equally and treat others the way you would want to be treated.
Try to make a lot of good, trustworthy friends.
Don't reveal too much about yourself. Keep people wondering.







, If you want to be cool and popular, then you can't look desperate, or like you're always trying to hang out with the cool kids or waiting for people to come up to you. If you act like the life of the party, people will think you are. Even if you're at the party and are talking to someone who you don't really like so much, if you try to make the most of the conversation, laugh, and look like you're having a great time, then people will think, there's a person who is always having an awesome time, and they'll want to come up to you, too.


This doesn't mean you should be completely fake. It just means you should be absorbed in what you're doing instead of always wanting to be doing something ""cooler"" or ""better.""

, Being cool and popular isn't just about looking that way, but it's about feeling cool and popular too. To do this, you have to be confident in who you are and know that you have something to offer to the world. Work on loving the person who you are and embracing the life that you have instead of wanting to be someone different. This can take years, but you have to make an effort to truly love yourself instead of just having others love you.


Being confident doesn't mean thinking you're perfect. In fact, being aware of some of your flaws and the things that you can improve will make you an even more confident person.
Being confident also means having confident body language. You should keep your head high, look straight ahead, and have good posture so that you look comfortable with who you are.

, Truly popular people are so happy with who they are that they don't try to please other people. If someone makes fun of your clothes or something you do, don't change your outfit or stop doing it. Instead, embrace who you are and learn to shrug off the jealous haters. It's okay to ask for advice when you're lost, but you should avoid doing what other people say just because you think it'll make you cooler.


If you're popular, then you'll be able to set the trends, not try to follow them.
Of course, it's impossible to stop caring about what people think overnight. But you have to make an effort to be your own person to get started.

, You don't have to be the teacher's pet or the most involved student to get noticed a bit. Be friendly, participate, and don't be a complete class clown. If you're silent in class or only talk to the one person you know, then you won't get noticed. You want people to see you and think, at least, ""Oh yeah, that girl is in my English class..."" You have to make some kind of an impression if you want to be popular.


If you have a lab partner or do group work, be friendly and nice to the people, even if you don't think you have much in common.
You don't have to raise your hand every two seconds to make other students notice you. Just participate when you have something to say.






If you have a test coming up, see if you want to form a study group with a few people. That can be an excuse for you to socialize a bit more.

, Joining a team sport is a great way to meet new people and to put yourself out there. If your school has team sports, great, and if not, joining a rec team can help you get to know even more people. Being part of a team can also help you know how to work with others and will get you more comfortable with a variety of people.


You don't have to be the most athletic person in the world to join a sports team, either. You just have to have some drive and the desire to learn something new.

, Clubs are another great way to meet more people and to try something new, especially if joining a sports team isn't for you. If your school has clubs, like the newspaper or yearbook, joining one would be a great way to meet a variety of people interested in different things. The more people you know, the more popular you will be. It's all about getting to know as many different people as possible, not just sticking to the same six ""cool"" people in your school.


Joining a club can also help you find something new that interests you, which will boost your confidence and make you feel like a more dynamic person.

, Hang out with the kids in your neighborhood, help out your neighbors, and spend time hanging out outside instead of spending hours trying to improve your image on Facebook. So what if the kids in your neighborhood are a little older or younger than you or they go to a different school? Hanging out with as many different people as possible will make you a more social person and will make you look and feel more popular.


If there are older kids in your neighborhood, then they can help you build your reputation, too -- being popular in the sixth grade doesn't mean only talking to sixth graders.

, To be popular, you have to get involved in more social activities. Accept invitations to parties even if you won't know many people there and get to know them. Throw parties of your own and have a pretty wide variety of people in your guest list. Go to the mall and movies with your friends on weekends instead of hanging out at home. And if events like school dances or other after-school events come up, make a point of being there.


The more people get used to seeing you out, the more you'll become a part of the scene. You don't have to be the most popular person at the dance or at the mall to get to know more people and to have a great time.

Be yourself.,
Take care of your schoolwork.,
Avoid breaking rules.,
Be friendly.,
Resolve conflicts peacefully.",How to Be Cool in Seventh Grade2," It is okay to adjust your appearance and behavior to fit in, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be true to yourself. Don’t be afraid to like what you like. Own it. This will make you happier and more confident, which makes you seem cooler. On the other hand, someone striving too hard to be cool is obvious to everyone around them becomes uncool.

, No, being studious isn’t considered cool. Neither is being grounded. If you don’t do the work, your parents may keep you in the house, make you go to tutoring, or make you do the work later anyway. In addition, doing badly hurts your future and being considered dumb doesn’t make you look cool either.


You don’t have to announce that you love school. Simply get the work done and do the best you can.

, In the seventh grade, you’re bound to hear plenty of stories of kids who experiment with relationships, sex, drugs, and disobeying. You may want to pull away from parents and teachers, but you’ll have better results not going out of your way to break rules to appear cool.


The risks others take seem cool now, but the time spent being superficial and partying makes you miss out on long-term friendships.The kids who socially strive to be cool by doing things like shoplifting, cutting class, and having relationships lose their coolness as you progress in life and they don’t., Seventh grade is difficult, particularly when you’re around popular kids. Many of them act aggressively to others raise their own status. This however is stressful and nasty. By treating everyone with respect, you’ll avoid making enemies and many who are tired of putting on an act to be cool will appreciate it.


Greet people warmly without offering any disrespect. Do your best to be personable.
Avoid talking behind someone else’s back or other sorts of bullying behavior.
Don’t forget to be friendly to adults, too. Although you want to get away from parents and teachers, showing hostility isn’t impressive and leads to more trouble.

, Fights may be encouraged by other kids, but the flared tempers don’t leave anyone looking cool. When conflicts do arise, try examining the problem, reasoning it through, and discussing a solution. The seventh grade is a difficult time of life, so fighting and being catty makes you look bad when emotions settle and sets you up for future incidents.After you’ve identified the problems and given your perspective, listen to the other person’s perspective.
Don’t use what someone else says to provoke or attack. Instead, find common interests and use these to make a decision.
Showing that you’re in control and have leadership skills will make you seem cool and leadership skills can be used to impress adults.

Put on a little cologne or perfume.,
Style your hair.,
Apply makeup sparingly.,
Dress attractively.,
Accessorize.",How to Be Cool in Seventh Grade3," In middle school, you’re at the point when your body begins to do weird things that cause you to feel that your reputation is in danger around other kids. If you haven’t previously been doing it, it’s time to take a shower every morning. This washes away body odor, sweat, and grease in hair. Use a small amount of bathing product, work it into a lather, and gently rinse with warm water.Be sure to wash your hair. If oily hair is a problem, choose shampoo and conditioner that is designed for oily hair.
If you plan on using perfume or cologne, avoid bath products that leave a strong scent.

, This is optional. You may not even have much hair that you want to shave, but other kids make you feel self-conscious. Unfortunately, quite a few people look down upon natural body hair and shaving is an adult activity many others are eager to try.


Ask your parents if you haven’t started yet, and let them show you how to shave properly.
Lather up shave gel on the damp, freshly-washed areas you will shave. Take a safe but sharp razor and move in the direction of the hair growth. For underarms, for instance, this requires moving the razor in all angles.
For girls, gently stroke up your legs. For the upper lip, stroke downwards.For boys, start from the side of the face and move in the direction of the hair growth. This is most often downwards until you get to the throat., When you sweat, your body produces odors. Deodorant is necessary to stop that. After taking a shower, apply your chosen deodorant to your underarms and consider using it on non-sensitive areas such as your feet. The spray or roll-on deodorant should go on evenly and last until you get home.Avoid deodorant that is very smelly. Smell is a powerful sense, and a bad smell is a sure way to be considered uncool.
Try antiperspirants if needed. Many deodorants are also antiperspirants, which prevent sweating. For excessive sweating, choose a brand that has more than ten percent aluminum in it., This is optional, but helps cover up the body’s natural odors. The fragrance doesn’t have to be expensive to be good. Find one that smells nice to you in nearby retail stores and begin applying them right after you’ve dried your skin after a shower, as that’s when they’re best able to get into your skin. Stand still and spray or dab a little bit onto you.The best areas to put on fragrance are warm areas such as the neck, lower jaw, chest, and shoulders.
Start with one spray or dab at first and let the fragrance rest. Rubbing it in makes the smell weaker.
Go slow. Avoid using too much. Your fragrance should not be detectable from far away and it should not smother those around you.

, Everyone in school can see your hair. A style that looks trendy will announce your coolness factor and one that looks lame will hurt your appearance. The most important factor is to work with your natural hairstyle and frame it in a way that emphasizes your features.


For inspiration, ask your hairdresser or parents. Also look at what celebrities and cool kids around you do, but remember that the best style will be uniquely you.
Products such as gel or straightener devices are an option, but be wary of copying a bland style that those around you try., Makeup is far from a necessity. There’s no reason to cover up your natural appearance, but you’ve most likely witnessed your mother and other adults applying makeup. If you do choose to use some, use small amounts. Going overboard on lipstick, eyeliner, blush, and foundation isn’t appealing.Try to stick to minimums, such as small containers of lip gloss and eyeliner.
Have your parent or a makeup counter clerk show you how to apply makeup properly.
Instead of covering your face, get used to your own skin. Learn to love it and gain confidence from your natural appearance. This will give you a coolness factor that makeup cannot provide.

, Appearance is important. When you dress well, you start feeling better and others view you better. Many students shop at expensive retailers and may look down on general stores like Walmart, but instead of spending all your money, find what looks good on you and work that into your own style.Find clothes that fit you well. That means your jeans shouldn’t be skin-tight, but they also shouldn’t be baggy. Girls, avoid short skirts and thin tops that will get you in trouble.
Try not to look like a typical student. This means limiting wearing what others are wearing, such as school logos, bland jeans, or worn-out shirts.
Look to others for ideas, but remember to make your own style instead of copying that of a popular kid.
If you wear a uniform, all you can do is try to change the uniform in alternative ways. Accessories are a good way to make an individual statement.

, If you have to wear a uniform, chances are you’ve already started this, but everyone can benefit from choosing accessories that look unique and individual. Choose ones that speak to you rather than ones that are simply expensive or popular. They should stand out enough that they catch the eyes of those around you but shouldn’t be over the top in brightness or design.Instead of wearing flip-flops or worn-out sneakers, find shoes of different designs and materials and match them to your outfit.
In winter months, try to avoid puffy coats, but don’t sacrifice warmth.
Choose a backpack, handbag, and school supplies with designs and colors that appeal to you and compliment your clothes.
Hair accessories and jewelry provide a great opportunity to apply color and designs in a way that displays your individuality.

Be prepared for your new middle school: A few weeks before school start going jogging at least 3 times a week, and eating healthy.,
Shop for clothes for your new middle school!,
Have good hygiene.,
Have your hair done, you need to always have your hair done.,
Always put on eyeliner and mascara.,
You need to be confident, friendly, and outgoing.,
Consider a Boyfriend: Popular girls ALWAYS have boyfriends.,
Be yourself: This is totally clichéd, but you need to SOMEWHAT be yourself.,
Make plans: Once you start hanging with the popular crowd start making plans with them.",How to Be Popular at a New Middle School," That way you can lose a few pounds. If you are already thin just tone up a little by doing some light pilates.;
,: Get some really cute new clothes. Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, Forever 21, Aeropostale, American Eagle, and even Rue21 have some pretty nice trendy clothing.

, Take a shower when you start to smell a little. Always have a stick of deodorant or antiperspirant on hand. Also apply some good smelling lotion and body spray. You need to smell good. Nobody is going to want to hang out with you if you smell like a pig! Wash your face at least every night, and if needed use acne medication.

, Either straighten it, or put in some loose curls. A cute high ponytail is nice, but don't do it very often. Also if you can, add a few highlights to your hair, but they really need to look good with your hair color.

, Eye shadow is a definite plus, but you should change up with color of the eye shadow depending of the color(s) of your outfit. Clear gloss is a must. If needed put on concealer and cover up but DON'T cake it on! If you already have extremely long lashes, don't wear mascara, it'll look like you are wearing falsies!

, There is no way you can be popular if you are shy. The first day say hi to people you sit next to in your classes, and talk to a few people who are by your locker. Exchange numbers with those people. Try to figure out who the popular people are, and once you know who they are, go up to one of them and start conversation. Don't talk too much, or you will come across as annoying. You must be VERY social and friendly.

, If you see a guy you are interested in make sure he is single and popular (if you have a popular boyfriend that's like buying a ticket into popularity) and start to flirt with him. But don't be too clingy. Casually flirt with others, but make sure he knows you're interested. If you have a boyfriend from your old school you are still extremely interested in, don't break his heart! It's already bad enough you had to move away from him.

, You CANNOT copy anyone, or you will be known as a wannabe.

, Ask if they wanna go to the mall, or if they want to go grab a bite to eat. (Diners are totally cool.)

Love being you.",How to Be Cool and Popular for Middle School Boys," Your close friends should really like you, and you should all have some similar things in common. You should be the center of attention in your group, but don't make them hate you. They should be loyal, smart, cool, and funny or outgoing nice people. Your official group should consist of 2-6 people. At least one or two should be the type to do whatever you want done for you. Buy them presents every now and then, invite them to parties or to do fun stuff like sleepovers or movies, and always spend time with them. Don't hang out with everyone in your class a little here, and a little there. You stick to them. A lot of boys talk about girls, so if your group seems like the type, go ahead! If your friends like hockey, and you do too, go ahead and play the game. On the weekends or during summer break, you could take them to a water park or an amusement park and go on the best rides. Make sure you wear all the best clothes, and always try to be the ""best-dressed"" in your group. Saying that you can't afford that stuff is not an excuse. If you think people are straying, or less loyal to you (friends or acquaintances or whatever) then get a secret from them - never do anything nasty with it, that's really low, don't even threaten to, they'll just assume and understand and be nicer - or at the very least, if they do stray, won't turn on you.


Remember - you want true friends, not idol worshipers (if your less close friends and classmates worship and idolize you, though, that would be a good thing).;
, Looking good is one of the main things of being a popular boy. Wash your hair every day, and use deodorant if needed, smell good, and wash your face every morning.


You should also have mint flavored gum handy for fresh smelling breath. Use mouthwash in the mornings.
Bring deodorant in your backpack too as an extra just in case.

, Focus on your hair, be conceited if you have to. Take note of the hairstyles that cool and popular kids have. Don't have it too long, or you'll look like a girl. You can have it somewhat long, but mostly just keep it normal.

Don't pass the mean thing. If you don't do it completely, you've got to do it a little bit. Don't treat your friends like losers. Losers you have to treat like losers. Your friends, you treat like your friends.
Be nice to girls. Girls you like you should just compliment them every now and then and be really nice to them. Unless they're your sister! Wink wink.

, You should always have the perfect thing to say to anyone who insults you, right away. Make sure what you say is quick, witty, and makes total sense. Here's a tip: you have to hit the opponent where it hurts the most. Find out what makes them squirm,and use that in a comeback. Don't let anyone get away with insulting you. Being quick witted and smart is always respected. If for some reason you can't think of a good comeback on the spot, stare your opponent down. Give a tiny eye roll, smirk, and look them up and down. This would make them feel insecure without you doing anything. Then you would have won the battle.


If someone does something to threaten your spot, put them in their place and be a b*tch. Say something to them that wouldn't make them go near you ever again, but still want to be you.

, People love mysterious, and secretive people. Make sure you have at least one person you can trust, which most likely would be your best friend. Tell secrets with your friends, and keep them between your friends and you.

, Don't buy dorky, mommy's boy, or extremely cheap clothes. If you want to be the center of attention, you should always go with a better brand but definitely not a fancy restaurant look. If you can't afford that, look for sales at some of the best brands, usually at the end of summer, there is a huge online sale at most stores! You can also go to cheaper brands that look more expensive, not everything has to be $100. Just don't have a trashy, cheap look. T-shirts from GAP are usually fine. Don't wear pink under any circumstances. Don't wear polos too often. Some ideas for clothing brands are ""Abercrombie"", ""Hollister"", ""Aeropostale"", ""Desigual"", and ""Nike"". Don't always wear brand clothing, wear a variety of clothing. Just again, no dorky stuff. Saying that you can't afford it is not an excuse.


Flip-flops are great for summer days. Avoid most sandals unless your feet are nice enough to show off.

, You should get at least an hour and a half of physical activity each day. Also, don't consume too much junk food or too many carbs. Join Sports teams, play the basketball game that everyone's doing at recess. It's a tough world out there, and nobody likes an obese or unhealthy kid. Try to lose weight before conquering your school if you're a little overweight, and you'll be fine. Don't be overly skinny.

, No one really has confidence. You just have to project it and make people think you do. Overtime you will be more confident but don't be afraid to be outgoing. Especially when you're putting someone in their place, you have to be confident.


If you feel very unconfident about yourself, type up 100, no more, no less reasons you rock.

, Don't play it dumb, or fake. Even though you're using these tips to become the ruler of your school, don't completely change who you are. You have to be yourself or people might avoid you. If the person you're trying to be friends with doesn't want to be friends with you, then it's their loss, not yours. Don't let somebody change you. If he/she doesn't like you for who you are, then move on to a different person. Be fake nice to people who you don't like, but make it obvious.

, Please don't go on about ""studying makes you nerdy"" because it's not true. Popularity in school doesn't last you forever. You'll need to be smart after school when you get a job. You don't have to show it that much, just be sure that you don't flunk everything.

, Spread a few rumors, but be witty with this and never let anyone trace it back to you. If they do trace it back to you, don't deny it. Smirk and say ""I know, so what?"" and walk away. People will think you're untouchable and perfect. Pull pranks on people, and always make sure someone in your clique, if it's not you, is always good at getting the latest scoop and gossip about everyone, so you have something to keep under lock and key until you need it. Wink wink again.

, If someone has fun even though it may be against the ""school rules"", don't tell on them. That will make everyone hate you. You don't go by the rules too much, but don't overdo not following them to the extent of expulsion. Unless you have enough schemes up your sleeve to be un-expelled, but you're not Blair Waldorf, so bottom line - don't get expelled. If you can get your teachers to love you, great, take advantage of that fact. Just don't start worshiping your teacher -- that would be awkward.


Don't be rude to teacher's faces, but don't be overly helpful and nice either. Feel free to gossip about teachers that you hate though. Everyone does it.

, When you're trying to get something with an adult, or if you're talking to the principal, hide yourself a little, and be sweet, even if you hate your principal to the bone. You'll almost never get in trouble doing it this way.

, People are probably going to insult you a few times, but they're mostly either envying you or they're too much of a goody two shoes. If someone says ""You're ugly"" or ""I hate you"" or ""You're mean"" or something like that, use one of your instant super witty comebacks that we discussed at the top of this page. People are going to envy you, or hate you because you're way more popular than them. Don't cry when someone says something bad about you, that's just downright dumb. Give a comeback that makes them squirm, and be a bitch about it to them. They'll be scared to pick a fight with you, and your clique is the backup.

, It can be useful, believe me. If someone does something to piss you off, don't let it slide or try to suck up to them to make them like you. Get revenge when you need to, they won't stand a chance.


Scheme with your group when you can.

, People may think you're self centered, but if you're the ruler, that's sorta got to happen.

Joining an extracurricular activity can help boost your status. It has the added benefit of allowing you to make new friends, increasing your popular nature.You can find people with common interests by joining a club that personally speaks to your passions. If you're interested in journalism, for example, joining the newspaper club can help.
If you're focusing on popularity, you may want to see what kinds of clubs the popular kids are joining. If the most popular girls in school are all in the debate club, this may be a great place to meet popular students.;
, In many schools, popular girls are involved in sports or athletics. Joining a sports team may help you get to know the popular students. If you end up excelling at sports, you may become popular yourself.


Train if you're unfamiliar with a certain sport. If you want to join the basketball team, for example, practice shooting hoops at a local park.
You may have to get in shape to join a club. Make sure you start small when it comes to getting in shape, as you don't want to overexert yourself. Start with small exercise sessions and work your way up.
Do not get too discouraged if you don't make a school sport's team. Remember that you can always try out again next year. It is also important to stay in shape and try to get better for next year's try-outs.

, Are the class presidents, treasurers, and representatives popular in your school? If so, you may benefit from running for student council. At the beginning of the year, when elections are held, try to get a campaign team together and go for a spot in student council.


Make sure you learn the rules and regulations for running for student council. You may have to get a certain number of signatures or sign up by a certain deadline.
Think of a great campaign slogan and plaster it on decorative poster boards. Put up your posters throughout the school.
Write a great campaign speech for your chosen position, clearly laying out what you'll bring to the job.

, If you want to be popular, you have to put yourself out there and socialize. Attend school events where the popular crowd is likely to hang out. Do not skip out on things like school dances, sporting events, and pep rallies.If you're shy, try to get a small group of existing friends to attend such events with you. However, be sure not to just hang out with your own crowd. You'll want to branch out and talk to new people. Increasing your friend's circle can help you gain popularity.
Do not be shy. It can be intimidating to meet others, but school events often make striking up a conversation easier. This is especially true for sporting events, where there may be a sense of camaraderie based on cheering for the same team.

, It may sound strange, but setting goals can help you make new friends. This is especially true if you're on the shy side. Setting small goals for yourself, that allow you to gradually break out of your shell, can help boost your popularity.Set small goals for yourself at first. For example, you can promise to make small talk with a new person before class every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
As you begin to feel more comfortable socializing with others, try to set bigger goals. You can promise you'll go to the birthday party you were invited to and try to talk to at least 3 new people.
If you're persistent with following up on your goals, you'll eventually feel much more comfortable socializing. This can allow you to meet new people and make a great number of new friends.

, If you want to make more friends, you have to focus on socializing outside the classroom. Once you get comfortable hanging out at school, try inviting someone out. Ask an acquaintance if he or she wants to go see a movie or get coffee. Try getting a group together to do something fun, like go to the mall.Do not be afraid to ask a popular girl to do something with you, especially if you have already established a firm connection with her in school. If you get along with someone inside the classroom, there's a good chance that person would be open to spending time with you outside the classroom.

, Fear of rejection is a big reason people refrain from putting themselves out there. However, rejection happens to everyone. Just because someone doesn't want to see a movie with you on a particular Friday does not mean that person is not interested in your friendship.People do have other obligations. If a popular girl declines your invitation to get coffee, she may genuinely be busy. Don't use this setback as a reason to retreat back into your shell.
Remember, there is a lot you do not know about other people. Anyone you talk to has a litany of obligations and issues you do not know about. If someone says ""No,"" that person may be shy or busy.
Take rejection as a minor setback. You can try asking someone to hang out in a few weeks if they say ""No"" the first time.

, Social media can help you be popular, especially in high school. Many teenagers have accounts like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter that are a major aspect of socialization. A lot of invitations to events, as well as conversation and bonding, happen online.Find out what kind of social media accounts are popular in your school. If the popular girls are really interested in Snapchat, sign up for an account. You may want to check with your parents before opening certain social media accounts, however, just to make sure that it's okay in your home.
Focus on meaningful interactions online. People tend to respond better to personalized messages over vague status updates. Congratulate one of the popular girls about winning a spelling bee or getting accepted into a summer internship program.
Keep in mind virtual friends cannot make up for real friends. While socializing online can enhance existing relationships, avoid talking to strangers on the internet. Not only will this not increase your overall popularity, it can be a safety issue as well.

, If you want more friends, you need to have something offer people. Remember the Golden Rule when seeking out new friends and treat others as you would wish to be treated. People are naturally drawn to people who are respectful and kind to others., While you should not focus on looks alone to be popular, confidence is key to popularity. Giving yourself a new haircut and changing up your wardrobe and makeup can help you feel better about yourself. This may make you more likely to put yourself out there and seek out new friendships, boosting your popularity.


Try to go with trends that you personally enjoy. If you're wearing something you hate, you won't feel confident in it. This can make you less likely to socialize. If you hate leggings, do not follow the legging trend in your school. If you notice a lot of popular girls wear boots, and you love your pair of black lace-up boots, this could be a great trend for you to follow.
You may want to change up your hair and makeup. You can go to the makeup counter at a local beauty salon and ask for an attractive every day makeup look. Ask a stylist at a salon what would be a flattering hairstyle for you. Makeup and hair that works well for your features can bolster your confidence and, in turn, increase your popularity.

, While smiling is a small change, it can make you look more positive and approachable. Striving to smile more can help increase your popularity and win you more friends. Work on smiling in front of a mirror until you find a winning and approachable smile. As you navigate the hallways, try to smile at others.When people talk to you, make an effort to smile during the conversation.
Smile when you make eye contact with people in the hallway.
When introducing yourself to new people, flash a smile while shaking hands.

, If you're a warm and friendly person, people can be drawn to you. This can win you more friends and more popularity. Work on cultivating a friendly attitude in order to be popular in your school.Try to show people you are happy to see them. If appropriate, give a friend a hug or a pat on the shoulder when meeting up with them in public.
Show genuine enthusiasm when around others. Smile and laugh during conversation.
Be open with new people. Strike up a conversation between classes. Sit at a new lunch table. Introduce yourself in a friendly fashion in an effort to get to know new people and make new friends.

, People are drawn to people who show an interest in their lives. During conversations with others, ask questions. Give people an opportunity to talk about themselves and their interests.Ask questions to learn about others. Ask about other people's interests and passions. Ask something like, ""What's your earliest memory?"" or ""What's your favorite thing to do on the weekends?""
This can be a great technique at parties. You'll be able to hold down a conversation for awhile by asking questions, as people enjoy talking about themselves. You can really get to know someone by asking a lot of questions.

, Being a good listener can help people like you more, allowing yourself to be more popular. Try to genuinely listen to what others say. If you don't understand something, ask a follow up question to make sure you understand. Showing a genuine interest in what others have to say can really help with your popularity.Give people space to speak. When someone finishes a sentence, wait 5 to 10 seconds to make sure they're truly done speaking.
Try to listen half as much as you talk.

, Another way to be popular is to be helpful to others. Listen when a friend is in need. If someone needs help with a homework problem, offer to lend them a helping hand. People want to be around people who are caring and kind to other people. Trying to be helpful can help you be more popular.While being helpful is great to make new friends, avoid getting taken advantage of. If someone is constantly asking you for favors, it's okay to establish boundaries.
You also want to make sure people are not using you. If friends are not helpful to you in return, you may be better off with such people out of your life.

, Being authentic can help you win friends. While many people feel they have to change to be popular, people tend to be naturally drawn to people who are comfortable in their own skin. Try to let your personality show through. Do not be afraid to bring up your own interests and passions when the opportunity presents itself. Let your unique qualities, like your sense of humor, shine through during conversations., While being popular can be fun, you should never put yourself in a situation that makes you uncomfortable just to please others. If you feel uncomfortable in a situation, listen to this gut instinct. A negative gut reaction often points to a dangerous situation.Back out of a situation when you become uncomfortable. Find a way to excuse yourself from a party or event if you get nervous.
You can try making up a quick excuse if you do not want to get into a confrontation in the moment. For example, say something like, ""Sorry, but I should get going. I'm coming down with a really bad headache.""

, If you're attending an event where drugs or alcohol are being used, it's best to leave. You do not want to be popular at the expense of your own safety. There also may be legal consequences to underage drinking or the use of illegal drugs. If you're pressured into doing anything illegal, find a way to leave the situation fast.If you're going to a party where there may be alcohol or drugs served, plan what to do in the event you're pressured to partake. You can have a trusted friend on call who can help get you out of this situation.

, Negative peer pressure can often encourage you to bully or ostracize other students. Popular clicks in middle or high school often engage in bullying. Remember, bullying can have serious emotional consequences for the target. Avoid the temptation of gossip and do not be openly cruel to other students as your school.It can be very hard to try to resist negative peer pressure, but remember the benefits. You'll feel better about yourself and you may influence other peers to resist things like bullying and gossip as well.

, Peer pressure is not always negative. Sometimes, your friends may pressure you into a taking a risk that is worth it. Good friends, for example, will encourage you to submit your poems to that contest or ask your crush on a date. Friends may also expose you to new and interesting things, like a new music group or author. While rejecting negative peer pressure, focus on the positives. Allow your friends to teach you about new things and help you find opportunities for fun, learning, and personal growth."

Eat lots of fruits and vegetables and also eat lots protein. Chicken, fish, eggs, tofu, and nuts are all excellent sources of protein. Be sure to drink at least 6 glasses of water a day and cut down on junk food and unhealthy drinks.;
, Try to join school sports, that way you can have fun, meet new people, and get active and healthier. Badminton, volleyball, cheer, track and field, soccer, basketball, the options are endless! Try to go for regular walks, bikes, or any method of transportation that requires you to be active around your area and get plenty of vitamin D and fresh air! If you want, you could do push-ups, sit-ups, crunches, lunges, squats, pull-ups, etc. and also lift weights.

, Take a shower every day and use a light but sweet scented body wash and a loofah. Also, use a moisturising and sweet body lotion after showering or bathing. Brush your teeth twice a day and floss once at night. Be sure to wear deodorant if you think necessary and wear clean, fresh clothes and underwear.

, Don't wash your hair every day, wash it every two to three days. Once your hair starts looking greasy, try putting it in a bun or braid. If it is unbearably oily, dry shampoo is your life saver. Choose a good shampoo and conditioner. When shampooing, make sure to use your finger tips to massage your scalp. Don't apply conditioner on your scalp. Don't over-bleach or dye your hair and try to avoid using heat tools. Air drying and heat-free hairstyles are the way to go.  Pick a good haircut, maybe bangs, layers, highlights, shoulder-length hair, etc.  Style it differently and experiment.

, Wash your face twice a day and use a gentle cleanser. Make sure to apply a moisturising cream or oil to your face after cleansing it or taking a shower/bath. Wear sunscreen on sunny days to avoid wrinkles when you get older or sun burns. Make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep a night. Exfoliate once a week if you wish and try using face masks to rejuvenate your skin.

, Wear clothes that you find appealing on yourself and that flatter your body. Stick to solid colours and cool designs like plaid or stripes. Flowy shorts, oversized shirts, Uggs, cardigans, loose tank tops, and black leggings are very comfortable. Try to get a cute and warm coat for the winter. Make sure you have at least one pair of runners, flip flops, boots, flats, and high heels for every occasion. Jeans can also make you look really good.

, You're at school to learn, not socialize. It is fun to socialize on the side, but make your first priority school, getting good grades, and having good education & future. Try your best and be sure to study for tests, do your homework, listen in class, ask questions if you don't understand, and stay organized.

, Join school teams and clubs. It's a great way to get known, meet new people with common interests, discover a new hobby or talent, etc. Even if you don't think you'll be that good at something, never be afraid to try. Try your best. If you don't like it, you can drop it. Try to have diverse interests.

, You don't have to be extremely outgoing or bright, but try to be friendly and kind to everyone. Don't get caught in drama or gossip, it is fun, but in the long run, you'll be hurting yourself or other people. Make eye contact and smile and laugh when you feel like it. Offer sincere compliments and favours without being asked. Be a good listener. When someone is talking, give your undivided attention to them and don't look at something or someone else.  Remember, don't be rude to people who you don't like or don't like you, simply ignore them.

, These are the people who you can lean on when you're having a hard time, who you can laugh with, cry with, go through thick and thin with. These friends will automatically click with you, and you'll know who these friends are.

, There are a lot of shy people out there. If you aren't the most outgoing or extrovert person out there, don't worry. Instead of overwhelming yourself with making tons of friends at once, take it one friend at a time. Try to say ""Hi"" to at least one person a day so that they aren't so afraid of talking to you. Don't look at the floor or cross your arms. Ask questions about other people, they will fall in love with you. It will naturally happen if you keep on interacting with them.

, Don't worry about being popular, relax and enjoy yourself. These three years will fly by so fast and before you know it, you'll be starting high school with new people, new experiences, new everything. You are so young. You still haven't graduated, experienced getting your license, marrying, having kids, living with the love of your life for your whole life, having grandchildren, so enjoy your pre-teen years. After high school, you'll be off to university and after university you'll create your own family. It's a long time, but it happens so fast that it can catch you off guard. Just smile and be happy."

Keep calm, and hope (or pray) that your results will be great.

,
Look at the questions and understand the ones that you have made a mistake on once you receive the paper.

",How to Do Well in Your Exams," Understand what is being taught in class. A lot of students refuse to pay attention in class because they think that when they get home, they can just flip through the pages in their textbook and that's all. However, the question is, if you can study on your own and don't need any assistance of a teacher, then why bother to even attend class? It's just a waste.


Listen to the teacher upfront.
Take down notes on what the teacher emphasizes.;
, To achieve this, you must first have the knowledge of certain things; in other words, the first step is the very basic step to continue your pathway to studying smart. The following steps are the guidelines to studying smart.

, Be attentive in class, and jot down whatever is important in your notebook. Writing a notebook of your own is one of the best ways to study, because you understand it best. Do not worry about how others can understand the material; only worry about understanding it yourself.

, Use this time to fully comprehend and understand the material. The biggest mistake students make is to only try to understand when exams are approaching. This is the failure that almost all students make.


The time you use to revise before the exam should not be the moment you try to understand and comprehend certain knowledge. Your revision moment should rightfully be the moment of merely recalling what you have known. That being said, revision should not last longer than 4 hours. It all depends, however, because sometimes we might have more topics to go through.

, This helps to improve your critical thinking skills.


Remember to always relate ideas and concepts, rather than focusing entirely on memorization. Memorization doesn't help when a certain question is twisted. To relate concepts and ideas, you need to find your own way of relating them together.
For instance, if you are studying osmosis, try to relate the concept in daily lives; use the pickling process, for example. You could then relate to hemolysis, cremation, hypertonic or hypotonic.
This method works best for all subjects, particularly Additional Mathematics.

, Simply glance through any highlighted point you previously made. Then, try to relate everything you have just learned. Just picture the few main points in your brain.


For example, if you are studying the reactivity of elements in the periodic table, picture the main ideas. What happens when going down Group 1 and what happens when going down Group 17 and 18? How does it happen? Why it happens? Why is it the reactivity increases or decreases?

, Use at least 2 minutes for each break, for every 20 to 30 minutes of studying. During this break, you can have something to drink, or even simply glance through your window and see what's going on outside. However, remember to get back to work once you have rested!

, This helps you to rethink ways to recall back what you have just read. It is proven that reading doesn't impact much in storing things into your memory. Try to teach yourself whatever you know, as if you were the teacher; it is one of the best ways to learn.

, We all know the adage, practice makes perfect, so apply it now. Practice with the knowledge that you have, so that you know how to use and apply the knowledge. This plays the most important role in improving on additional mathematics and other science-related topics.

, Set up a revision timetable up to days, weeks or even months before the exam. The amount of revision time needed will depend on how big the exam or test is. You should revise the main topics for at least 20 minutes a day the week before the exam. Don't study at the last minute!

, If you are too tired then you will forget everything you studied and if you don't eat well your brain will not operate smoothly.

, Instead, say the formulas in your mind or the properties and its names instead of just reading the textbook all over again.

,, Don't try to be Superwoman or Superman and try to cram everything in your head.Take a break after about 1 or 2 hours.

, Remember this quote from Nikki Bella: ""I am fearless and therefore I do what I do"".

, Try to get at least 8-10 hours of sleep.

,, Take deep breaths and don't get distracted with other stuff.

,, Focus on the possible and reasonable answers.

Be yourself.,
Be stylish.,
Choose an appropriate hairstyle.,
Wear minimal makeup.,
Link arms with a few other popular girls, and walk down the hall, giggling and laughing.,
Don't bully anybody!,
Get involved in activities.",How to Be a Popular Sixth Grade Girl," Never feel obligated to make yourself look different because all the 'cool' people are saying to do it. Be yourself, that's what people like.

, You don't have to have the newest designer bag to be considered popular, being considered popular does not mean having all the newest clothes and accessories. But many people (sadly) do judge by looks, so to keep up with your age of style is your best option. Knowing you are only 11 to 12 (maybe 13) years of age, don't dress in a ""sexy"" outfit. Also avoid graphic tees with hello kitty on them and other cartoon shows. Wear running style shorts and a tee shirt of your liking.


Ripped/laddered jeans are popular. Shorts can be popular, in cute styles with lace, and wear belts with them.;
, Long hair is popular, usually worn in ponytails. Some ways of wearing hair include:


If you have long hair, try doing this: Comb it with a hairbrush, spray it with light detangler, put a headband in, gather your hair and put it into a ponytail with a cheerleading bow.
If you have short hair: Put a headband in, and a hair bow in the side.
If you have medium hair: Put it in a little ponytail with light hairspray.

, Wearing a lot of makeup is bad for your skin at such a young age, it will clog your pores and increase acne breakouts. The only 'beauty' things you need to be doing are:


Washing your face (with any face wash, because you are still young a gentle face wash is best).
Brushing your teeth; you are now old enough to throw out the old fluoride-free toothpaste and go out to get some toothpaste with fluoride. After about 10 years old, your teeth will be needing the fluoride.Moisturize your face (your face is beautiful as it is!) Keep your skin moisturized to help avoid dry skin and peeling skin., It's a sign of friendship, and people will probably talk to you more, because they now know you're really friendly.


Only link arms with boys if they're your boyfriend, and make it look cute, like your head comfortably nestled into his shoulder. You'll be the ""toast"" of the school, especially if he's the most popular boy in school!

, In movies, they may do it to ""climb"" the social ladder; in real life it's the opposite. It will give you a bad reputation and your friends will not tend to be too happy to see you bullying others.

, Consider such activities as cheerleading, dancing, singing, gymnastics, etc. Don't change anything you already love doing!

Write note cards on index cards.,
Practice.,
Do your research.",How to Do a Presentation in Class1," Write main ideas on your index cards. Don't write details, or be stuck with the fate of looking down, staring at your note cards while reading. Put in some fun facts, interactive questions, and other interactive activities on the cards to share with the class.


Write down keywords or main ideas. If you need to consult your index cards, you're only going to want to scan the index card for information, not read every last word.
Most of the time, the act of putting information down on your index cards will help you remember the information. So, while you might not strictly need the note cards, it's a nice security blanket to have if you happen to forget what you were going to say.;
, In most presentations, it is pretty obvious who has practiced and who hasn't. Work on what you're going to say and how you're going to say it. You'll feel a lot more confident when you do the real thing and you'll eliminate the ""likes"" and ""ums"" unlike those who try to ""wing it.""


Practice in front of your family or friends, or in front of the mirror, when you rehearse your presentation. It's probably better to do it in front of friends who you may not know well, as this will help you replicate the feeling of being in front of the class.
Ask your friends for feedback after you finish your presentation. Was the presentation long enough? How was your eye contact? Did you stammer at all? Were all the points clearly made?
Make a critique of your practice performance. Challenge yourself to work on all the things that you believe you can improve during the real presentation. When it comes time to deliver the real deal, you'll feel confident knowing that you've worked extra hard on what was toughest for you.

, In order to give an engaging presentation, you need to know what you're talking about. You don't have to become an expert, or read every book or website ever written about your topic, but you should be able to answer any questions your teacher or classmates might give you.


Get quotes from reliable sources. Good quotes make a good presentation great. Taking what smart people have said and putting it into your presentation not only makes you look smart, it shows the teacher that you spent time thinking about what other people said.
Make sure your sources are trustworthy. There's nothing that can quite break your confidence like a fact that turns out to not be a fact. Don't always trust the information you get off the Internet.

Smile at your audience.,
Feel confident about your presentation.,
Make eye contact.,
Be sure to have inflection in your voice.,
Use hand motions.,
Have a good conclusion.,
Walk back to your seat with a smile.",How to Do a Presentation in Class2," When it comes time to present, there's nothing that draws your audience into your presentation than a good old fashioned smile. Be happy; you're about to teach your entire class something they didn't know before.


Studies have shown that smiles are infectious; that means that once you smile, it's hard for everyone else not to smile. So if you want your presentation to go off without a hitch, force yourself to smile. That'll make everyone smile; and maybe those smiles will make you actually smile.

, When you give your class a presentation, your teacher is essentially having you take over their job for a little while. It's your job to make sure everyone understands what you're trying to tell them. Make sure you pay attention to how your teacher does this before your presentation, because teachers are expert presenters.

]

Visualize success before, during, and after your presentation. Be humble about what you do — no need for cockiness — but imagine a successful presentation at all times. Don't let the thought of failure creep into your mind.
In many ways, your confidence is just as important as the information you're delivering. You don't want to spread misinformation, or skimp on doing your research, but a lot of what you'll be graded on — and what the other students come away with — is going to be your level of confidence. Also if you are confident, you will have a better time exchanging ideas with the class.
If you need a confidence boost, think big picture. After 10 or 15 minutes, your presentation will be over. What will your presentation matter in the long run? Probably not very much. Try to do the best you can, but if you're getting nervous, remind yourself that there are much more important moments in your life to come.

, Nothing is more boring than listening to a presenter who looks at the floor or at note-cards. Relax. Your audience is made up of your friends and you talk to them all the time; talk the same way now.


Have the goal of looking at every person in the classroom at least once. That way, everyone will feel like you've engaged with them. Plus, you'll look like you know what you're talking about.

, Your goal is to engage your audience, not put them to sleep. Be animated about your topic. Talk about it as if it was the most interesting thing in the world. Your classmates will thank you for it.


Inflection is the kind of movement that radio DJs put into their voice; it's the ramped-up pitch in your voice when it gets excited. You don't want to sound like you've just seen a lion, but you also don't want to sound like you've just seen a squirrel, either. Vary it up to make the presentation more interesting.

, Move your hands along as you talk, using them to emphasize points and keep the audience interested. It will also channel your nervous energy into a better place.

, You've probably heard the presentations that end in something like ""um... yeah,"" Your conclusion is your final impression on your audience, including your teacher. Make it exciting by introducing a final statistic, or come up with something creative to do at the end. Your conclusion can be anything so long as your audience knows you're finished.


Tell a story, maybe one with a personal note. Stories are great for history or English presentations. Maybe you can tie your presentation into a little anecdote about a famous historical person?
Ask a provocative question. Ending with a question is a good way of getting your audience to think about your presentation in an interesting way. Is there a certain conclusion you want them to come to?

, Know that you just aced your report and that you just did something that many people would never be able to do. Don't be disappointed if you don't get applause. Just stay confident.

Stand up to peer pressure.,
Ignore rumors about you.If someone has spread rumors about you, don’t let it get you stressed.,
Support a friend who is in trouble.,
Be calm and respectful with authority figures.,
Balance school and your relationship.,
Make time to socialize.",How to Deal With Stressful Situations in School1," Sometimes your peers will try to convince you to do something you don’t want to. For example your friends may want you to skip school, have sex, or try alcohol or drugs. Don’t let it stress you. Instead, ignore their attempts and stick to what you believe is right.For instance, if your friend wants you to go to a party where you know there will be beer, you can say, “No. I’m not going. I’m too young and that’s trouble waiting to happen.”
If someone is pressuring you to have sex when you're not ready, then let them know that you aren’t interested and they need to drop the subject.
You might calmly say, “I’m not doing that and, really, I’m not even talking to you about that.”;
, You know the rumors aren’t true and the people who really know you and care about you won’t believe the rumors, either. Don’t waste your time getting stressed about it, just hold your head up and keep doing you.Remind yourself that you can't control what other people say and do, and if people are going to talk and gossip, there's little you can do to change that. Spending time worrying about something over which you have no control is just going to exhaust you, stress you out, and ultimately accomplish nothing.
When you can, just ignore it when someone says something about the rumor. They are probably just trying to stress you. Don’t let them.
If you feel you need to address it, then it’s okay to calmly explain that the rumor is not true.
For example, you might say, “No, that’s just a silly rumor. I didn’t eat 12 ice cream cones.”

, It can be hard when your friend has done something wrong, has been hurt in some way, or is hurting themselves.You can deal with this stressful situation if you support your friend and ask for help with the situation.


Listen to your friend and let them know that you care and want to help them out.
You might say, “I feel bad that you are going through this and I want to help you with this situation.”
Even if your friend asks you not to, it will be less stressful for you and more helpful for your friend if you ask an adult you trust to help with the situation.
Tell your friend, “I think we should let someone who can help us know what is going on.”
You can even talk to an adult without using your friend’s name, if you need to. For example, “Mrs. Carter, can I to talk to you about a friend who’s hurting himself?”

, There will be times that your teacher, principal, or even your parents stress you out. They may be nagging you about grades, getting onto you about something you did (or didn’t do), or just being generally annoying. You may want to ignore them, walk away, or say something smart, but that will just get you in trouble. You can deal with authority figures stressing you out in school by staying calm and respectful instead.


Listen to what they are saying to you. There may be something useful in what is being said.
You can tell them that they are stressing you by saying something like, “I’m sorry, but this situation is really stressing me out right now.”
Take a few deep breaths to calm yourself down and remember that adults are here to help you.
If you need to respond to a question or explain something, then don’t interrupt, keep your tone calm, and remember to say ""excuse me,"" ""please,"" and ""thank you.""
For example, if your teacher yelled at you for talking when you didn't, you could say, “Excuse me, Mrs. Peters, it wasn’t me talking.”

, Although having a boyfriend or girlfriend can be fun, it can also be stressful when you are also trying to balance school. Don’t feel rushed or pressured to be in a relationship. Just take your time, focus on school, and focus on having fun when you do get into a relationship.


Learn to set boundaries when in a relationship. This means defining — first for yourself, then communicating to the other person — what you are and are not willing to accept in a relationship. You can set physical boundaries (such as what you are ready to do sexually); boundaries about your time (making sure the other person knows you have softball practice on weekdays and must study afterwards, so you can only hang out on weekends); boundaries about behavior (if the person insults you or becomes abusive in any way, you will end the relationship); and so on.
Make your boundaries clear to the other person. If they continually violate your boundaries or pressure you to do things you have stated you will not do, then you can feel confident that this person is not respectful and is not a very good partner.
You never have to be in a relationship with someone just because they, or anyone else, wants you to. For instance, don't go out with someone you don't like just because all your friends are coupled up and you feel left out.
Make sure that being in a relationship doesn’t interfere with getting your schoolwork done. Learning to prioritize is an important skill that you can practice now.
While you may want to talk to the person for hours each night, ask yourself if this is really necessary. Focus on the quality of the time you spend together rather than the quantity. For instance, send a sweet, heart-felt text as opposed to spending hours texting about nothing.

, Spend some time with your friends and classmates outside of school. Being around people you can talk to, who support and encourage you, will help you handle a lot of the stressful situations you deal with in school.


Hang out with people that make you feel good about yourself and encourage you to be a better person.
Get to school or class a little early so that you can chat a bit with your friends and classmates.
Spend time with your peers doing activities or something not related to school. For example, you could meet one of your friends from class for coffee or tea, go for a bike ride together, or take a pottery class.
Make sure you are socializing at the right time. During class or other quiet times is not the right time and can get you in trouble.

Make amends when you do something wrong.,
Balance work and school.,
Talk about stress that adults are causing you.,
Find support.",How to Deal With Stressful Situations in School2," If you find yourself in trouble for doing something wrong, the best thing to do is to admit what you did and apologize for it.It will be much less stressful for you if you make amends than if you try to deny it or act rebellious.


Be honest about what happened. You will feel better about not lying and your teachers and principal will respect you more.
For example you might need to say, “Yes, I did cheat on my history quiz.”
Apologize and try to repair any damage that may have been done by your actions.
For example you might need to say, “Brandi, I’m sorry I spread that rumor. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.”
Or, for instance, “Mrs. McEntee, I’m sorry I wrote my name on the desk. I’ll clean it off.”

, If you are working and going to school at the same time you may find yourself extra stressed. You may be having difficulty getting enough sleep, getting your schoolwork done, or trouble getting to school and work on time.

Sit down with your parents or your supervisor and create a plan for how you can work but also complete your school assignments without a lot of stress.
Consider alternative ways of going to school if you have to work to support yourself. For example, explore taking online, weekend, or night classes.
Be sure that you give yourself some time off from both work and school so that you don’t burn yourself out. Try to save a half hour each day for you to do something you enjoy, like read a magazine, watch a TV show, or play a game.

, Sometimes it’s not just your schoolwork, friends, and other activities that are stressing you out. Sometimes your teachers or parents are the ones causing you stress.If an adult is doing something that makes you stressed, you should talk to someone you trust about it.


If it’s a situation of typical adult nagging or being annoying, then venting to someone can make you feel better.
For example, you might tell your friend, “My mom is really on my case! She said until my grades improve, I can’t hang out after school!”
If an adult is doing or saying things that make you feel bad about yourself, threatened, or unsafe, you should definitely tell another adult you trust.
For instance, if your coach made a sexual comment around you, you could tell your dad, “Hey, I need to talk to you about something Coach said.”
Or, for example, if your mom calls you names when she gets angry, you might say to your teacher, “Can I talk to you about some things going on at home?”
If your school has a counselor, try making an appointment to talk with them. They can teach you how to communicate in a productive way, how to deal with stress, or just be an ear to listen when you need to talk.

, There are many people who are invested in your wellbeing and can support you when you're struggling. Parents, other family members, teachers, friends, counselors, coaches, and religious leaders are all people you can go to with your problems. Know that when you are stressed, confused, or feel alone, there is always someone who can help and support you. If your parents aren't supporting you, a grandparent, teacher, friend, or even a friend's parents may be able to pick up your parents' slack.

Good time management may be one of the most important parts of managing it all and feeling less stressed in school.Make sure you are starting your homework early enough each day to finish it and still get a good night’s sleep. Teenagers need between eight and ten hours of sleep each night.Use an agenda, calendar, or planner to help you schedule time to work on long-term projects and reports. Pencil in due dates for each phase of the project.

Label folders and use sticky notes to remind you what you need to turn in and what you need to do.

,

If you can, then take a quick walk to clear your head. Even if it’s just a walk to the water fountain or restroom, it can help you deal with stressful schoolwork.
Try taking a few minutes to relax before you start your homework when you get home. Also take breaks while you are completing your homework.

, Waiting until the last minute to study or write a report will only increase your stress level and possibly result in a bad grade. But if you make a plan and prepare for exams, reports, and projects before they are due, you will feel much less stressed.Break major assignments down into smaller parts and decide when you need to complete each of the smaller parts.
For example, you might break a project on the Constitution down into four parts: your research, report, poster, and speech.
Study for tests by reviewing one concept or idea at a time. Make sure you start studying far enough in advance to review all the material.

, There may be times that your schoolwork is overwhelming you. You may not understand a concept or may have fallen behind in your work because of an illness or other situation. You can handle this stressful situation by asking for help and relying on your support system.It’s better to let your parents know that you’re having problems with your schoolwork early on. They may be able to help you with it, talk to your teacher, or even get you a tutor.
You might say, “Dad, I’m having problems with my algebra. Could you help me out?”
Let your teacher know when you don’t understand something or think you won’t be able to turn in an assignment on time.
For instance, you could try, “Mrs. Castillo, Could you help me? I think I may need more time finishing my report.”

Be kind.",How to Be a Hot Preteen2,"  Sports are sexy if you do them without sweating and yelling like crazy.  Try doing dance, tennis/badminton, soccer, or cheerleading.  One of those things, but of course do as many sports as you would like.  They're healthy and good for you.  Stay active and sporty.

,  Don't try to be all girly and cute.  Casually smile with your eyebrows raised or give a quick wink to your crush.  Be sort of calm and quiet.  This makes you look mature, hot, and makes people respect you more.  Be easygoing and social though.  Try to make friends.

,  Late elementary/middle school is not the time to be kissing and bragging about boyfriends yet.  Give a quick wink, wave, say hi, or do the eyebrow raising smile.  Don't play with your hair or else you'll look sort of cute and girly.  Play a little hard to get and smile at boys.

,  Be confident in yourself, your body, your dreams, everything.  Confidence is a really big part of being hot, as you may have guessed.  Hotness isn't just about attracting boys/making girls jealous, it's about feeling good in your own skin and feeling liked and special.

,  Last but not least, be really kind and grateful for what you have.  No one likes a spoiled brat who judges everyone by their cover.  Try making as many friends as you can and doing favors for others.  Don't just do it for your reputation, do it because you want to be a good person.  Cheesy, I know, but true.  Always say please and thank you, recycle, and you're hot!

Find out what your school colors are.,
Find a jersey or other shirt with your school’s name on it.,
Slip on bright track pants in one of your school’s colors.,
Spruce up your footwear.,
Accessorize in school colors.,
Coordinate your makeup and nail polish.",How to Have the Best School Spirit1," Many schools hold spirit days when everyone sports their school colors, and many universities encourage students to attend sporting events while wearing the school’s jerseys and colors.Whatever the occasion, showing up decked out in your school’s colors will let everyone know how strong your school spirit is and what a good team player you are.;
, Perhaps the most important element of your school-themed ensemble is your top, as it’s often the first thing you’ll notice about someone’s outfit. This is especially true if it has some kind of text or graphic emblazoned on it, so if you have a t-shirt, hoodie, or sports jersey touting your school’s name or insignia, wear it!


If you don’t have any school merch, don’t worry! Just use a shirt that features one or more of your school colors prominently, such as a solid long sleeve tee or a plaid shirt showing two or more hometown hues.
Keep an eye out for any pro sports merchandise you might have that features colors similar to those of your school. For example, if your colors are black, silver and red, you could wear a Chicago Bulls or Blackhawks jersey, or you could sport a Team Britain, Australia, France, or USA—all of which boast the colors of red, white, and blue on their flags—if your school also uses these colors.

, Unless you own sweatpants or basketball shorts from being on one of your school’s teams, you probably don’t have any pants which include all of your school colors. It’s probably easiest, then, to find a pair of sweatpants or track pants—bottoms which tend to feature brighter colors than everyday ones—in a school color. If you don’t own any, you can probably find some affordable options at a general merchandise store such as Walmart, Tesco, or Costco.


Brightly colored jeans and trousers have become a trend in recent years, so if you’re willing to purchase new items for your school spirit ensemble, check out the denim department at trendy retailers such as the Gap, Target, and Forever21.No flashy track pants or jeans and no time or money to buy them? No worries! If black or blue feature in your school’s emblem, just wear leggings, jeans, or trousers in blue or black. If black doesn’t feature in your colors, a pair of black bottoms will still be a neutral base to highlight your school-spirited sweater or t-shirt.

, Although sneakers and running shoes often come in loud color combinations, you might not have a pair which fits your school palette. In this case, you can find a pair of cheap flip flops in one of your school colors. Superstores such as Target and Costco often have bins of basic flip flops available for rock bottom prices, and you might as well go for a low-quality pair since you won’t be using them for long.You can also spruce up a pair of basic black or white sneakers with some colorful socks. Roll your pants up or pull the socks over your pants so the socks are visible, and you’ll be screaming spirit from head to toe.
If you have socks in both or all three of your school colors, wear them all! Roll them up to different heights so that they create a tiered sleeve of school spirit.

, While it can be difficult to find jewelry in shades aside from classic silver and gold, you can add school spirit to other, non-jewelry elements of your wardrobe. For example, you can wear ribbons or a matching headband in your hair, don a baseball cap in school colors, or wrap a scarf around your neck.

, Seemingly small details like nail color and face makeup can make a big difference to the overall impression of your outfit, so mind the small stuff if you want to make a big splash in the school spirit arena! Most drugstores carry affordable, bright eyeshadow palettes and nail polishes—many of which don’t differ drastically from their high-end equivalents—so you don’t have to break the bank in service to school spirit.Some schools don’t allow loud makeup or nail colors, so double-check with your institutional dress code before going crazy with cosmetics.
If you’re not confident in your makeup mastery, consider popping some sparkly star stickers or glitter onto your cheek bones or at the corners of your eyes. Even if silver or gold aren’t in your school’s repertoire, it will jazz up your look and make the other colors pop.

Explain that some days you may need to go to the nurse or school counselor, or may need to get out of the room for a few minutes.


Most teachers will quickly agree with doing anything they can to help you cope with a panic attack that occurs during the school day. However, it may be necessary to have your parents meet with or call the teacher to discuss this issue or bring in a signed note from your doctor.;
, This allows you to leave the environment so you can practice calming techniques, but it also allows the teachers to continue working with the other students.


Talk it over with each teacher to see what's the most appropriate way for excusing yourself. You might simply make eye contact with the teacher and point towards the door. You may ask ""Can I be excused, Mr. Bolton?"".
Work with your teachers, school administrators, and school counselors to determine the best course of action. You may be able to take a seat near the door to avoid disrupting the class when you have to leave to deal with panic.

, How you cope with panic attacks during school will depend on the resources available to you. For example, you may be able to take a time-out in the school nurse or counselor’s office. Since many teens deal with anxiety and panic, these professionals will know what to do to help you calm down.If it is not possible for you to visit the school nurse or counselor, you might discuss with your teachers or principal whether you can go into a restroom or walk outside for some fresh air for a few minutes.

, If you find that many of your school classes and activities are constantly being missed or interrupted due to panic, you may require medications. With severe or seemingly uncontrollable instances of panic it may be helpful to take medications before or during the school day to reduce symptoms.


Discuss the possibility of medications with your doctor to see if this is a good choice for you. Medications used for panic attacks include antidepressants, which must be taken for longer periods in order to experience any benefits, and benzodiazepines (or anti-anxiety meds), which can be taken during a panic attack to alleviate symptoms within 30 minutes to an hour.Remember, medications alone will not get to the root of panic disorder. Most doctors advise a combination of medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes for best results. Also, keep in mind, that benzodiazepines can be highly addictive and they may affect your ability to drive safely, so use these meds with extreme caution., If you are having a panic attack in a crowded hallway or class, calmly, but quickly, give your teacher the cue and then make your way to the nurse's or counselor's office or the restroom.

, When your body is experiencing panic your heart starts beating rapidly, you may feel a pain in your chest, your hands may shake, you may feel short of breath and you may start sweating among other signs.Getting control of your breathing can help you to calm down and reduce panic.


Sit on a chair, the closed lid of a toilet, or on the floor with your back up against the wall. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Take slow, controlled breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.
As you inhale the hand on your belly should expand, and it will collapse with each exhale. The hand on your chest should move only a little.
Breathe in while you count to four, hold your breath for a few seconds, and then release the air as you count down from four. Keep repeating the cycle of inhaling and exhaling until you start to feel calmer.

, Sometimes, you can control feelings of panic with distraction techniques. These strategies allow you to take your mind off of panic until the symptoms subside. A few distraction techniques you can try to relax include:Counting. You can count square tiles on the bathroom wall. You can try counting backwards from 100, or work out the multiplication table in your head (e.g. 1x1=1, 1x2=2, and so on).
Reciting. You can make up or recite the words to a poem, or go over the lyrics to a favorite song in your head.
Visualizing. Use your mind and your senses to picture a place that makes you feel safe. This place can be a cabin on a lake, grandma's house, or an exotic waterfall. Call to your mind different sensations about the place. How does it sound there? What does it look like? What smells are associated with this place?

, When you are feeling panicky, it's common to expect the worst. You can help yourself to overcome negative thinking and minimize your anxiety by thinking positive thoughts. Remind yourself that you always survive these attacks. Repeat a mantra aloud or in your head to positively counteract the thoughts and feelings of dread you experience during an attack.""I am the picture of calm.""
""This will pass.""
""In a few moments, I will be just fine.""
""I am in control.""
""Anxiety can't hurt me.""

, Ask a nurse or teacher to guide you through this experience if the attack is severe. If you wish, they may even let you contact your parents.


You can say something like, “I am having a severe panic attack and my calming strategies are not working. Can you please help me calm down?”

, Adolescents and teens who have panic disorder may miss lots of time from class or get behind on assignments. Having to leave the classroom environment to calm down can interfere with your schoolwork and make you even more anxious.Try to get back to class once you're feeling like yourself again. Be sure to follow up with your teachers to see what you missed during your absence.
As you become more capable of handling your anxiety at school, you may be able to do a number of these coping techniques while sitting in your desk. That way you don't have to worry about leaving class or missing too much of the lectures.

, Students with panic disorder can easily fall behind other students because they may have to leave the classroom environment or miss school more than other students.


You should make an extra effort to keep your parents and teachers in the loop of what's going on with you. If you feel like your workload is too stressful or unreasonable, think about dropping a course or an extracurricular activity.
If your parents often pressure you to be high-achieving, speak with your school counselor about some ways you may discuss this issue with them. She may be able to help you find ways to talk to your parents and feel less pressure about their expectations of you.

, Bullying can negatively affect those who are bullied, those who bully, and those who witness bullying.Kids who are bullied may experience symptoms of depression and anxiety, which means that instances of bullying could be the source of your panic at school.Take a stand against bullies at school by:Raise your chin and make eye contact with the student who is bullying you. Tell the student in a calm, even voice to leave you alone. You can also choose to ignore the bully.
If speaking up for yourself or ignoring the bully does not work, don't keep bullying to yourself. Tell someone as soon as possible. Tell a teacher, parent, older sibling, or school counselor about what is going on.
You may also want to avoid the places at school where bullies gather.

, The older you get, the more responsibilities you have in both school and at home. If you are not managing your time well, you could be putting yourself at risk for even greater anxiety. Here are some tips for better time management:Break bigger projects down into smaller tasks, like dividing a book report down to reading the book, then reviewing the book and taking notes, then writing an outline, then a first draft, then editing and proofreading for a final draft.
Make a list of what you need to get done and cross off as you go.
Decide how much time you need to complete a task, set a timer and move on to a new task once the time has elapsed.
Assess your weekly schedule to see if you have a balance between school, extracurriculars, and home life that makes sense to you.

, You may not see the connection, but your lifestyle habits can influence your anxiety. Making some small changes in the way you live can help you to reduce anxiety and live an overall healthier life. Lifestyle changes that may help prevent or minimize panic attacks include:Exercise. Engage in regular physical activity to elevate your mood, such as walking, yoga, boxing, or any activity that gets your body moving.
Diet. Eat a healthy, balanced diet of vegetables, fruits, lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. Avoid caffeine and alcohol as they may worsen symptoms.
Sleep. On average, sleep 7 to 9 hours each night. Shut off electronic devices at least an hour before bed and try to go to sleep and wake up around the same time each day.
Stress-management. Find relaxing activities to help you cope with stress and anxiety before they lead to panic. Call a friend. Take a warm bath. Go for a run or walk your dog around the block.

, Check in with her regularly, if only for a brief chat or update. Teachers or other students may not have a good understanding of what you are experiencing, but a counselor can be a great source of support.

, Most universities offer free counseling services to students, as well as basic medical services. You may even be able to find or start a support group for students with panic disorder.Find out what resources your university has to offer that may provide you with some support while you are away from home.Working with a counselor can help you to develop better ways to manage your anxiety and to get through panic attacks. Make an appointment at your university's counseling center as soon as possible.

, Unlike high school, in college it is not usually necessary to ask to leave class to go to the bathroom or to do something else. However, you may miss important points by leaving class to deal with a panic attack, or your professor may find it disruptive if you get up in the middle of a lecture and hurry to the door. That is why it is important to tell your professors about your condition and work out a plan to excuse yourself from class if needed.


For example, you might meet with your professor after class and say something like, “I have a panic disorder, so sometimes I may need to leave class suddenly to calm myself down. I wanted to talk to you about ways that I can minimize disruptions if this happens during one of your classes. What do you suggest?”
Make sure that you consider the class size and available exits. For example, your professor might suggest that you sit near the door in a small class or at the back of the lecture hall in a large class.

, If you find that certain classmates or friends intensify your anxiety, then try not to spend too much time with these people. Instead, try to spend time with people who have a calming presence. For example, people who have bad study habits (staying up all night before an exam, writing papers the day they are due, etc.) are likely to be anxious and panicky themselves. You should also avoid people who have poor stress management skills and who use drugs, alcohol, or other means to deal with stress.
Try to spend more time with people who have good study habits and who practice healthy stress management techniques. For example, gravitate towards people who plan ahead for assignments, ask questions in class, and who manage stress in healthy ways, such as exercising and meditating.
Consider joining a club to meet people who share your interests and passions. A club can be a great way to build your social connections and enjoy yourself outside of class, which may reduce your anxiety., To reduce anxiety, take some extra time to get organized and plan ahead for stressful situations. Getting your books, notes, laptop, and other class materials ready ahead of time may help you to feel less anxious and reduce the chances of a panic attack.


Keep track of important due dates and other deadlines in a planner. For example, as soon as you find out when a paper is due for a class, write down the due date in your planner along with any special details about the assignment that you need to remember.
For example, if you have an exam coming up, then take about 10 minutes the night before the test to put everything that you will need into your backpack. Then, write the time and place of the exam in your planner or even on a piece of scrap paper as a reminder., Taking notes can help you to stay focused on what your professor is saying and reduce the chance that you will start dwelling on thoughts that may lead to a panic attack. Make sure that you always have a pen and paper in front of you when you attend your classes and write down as much information as you can during class.If you are having a hard time figuring out what kind of notes to write, then drawing in your notebook during the lecture may also help you to stay focused on something other than anxious thoughts.

, It is important to avoid pulling all-nighters and cramming for exams, because this can increase your anxiety levels. Instead, try to study a little bit every day and take a break if you have been studying for a while. When you are studying, give yourself a short 10 to 15 minute break once every two hours. During your break you can:call a friend or family member
go outside for a quick walk
eat a snack
check your social media accounts
watch some videos on the internet

Bullies gain satisfaction from making others feel hurt or uncomfortable, so reacting to them will only encourage them further. The bully wants attention and if you show them that they are emotionally hurting you, they will get more pleasure out of doing it.


This tactic may backfire depending on the bully, so read the situation carefully. Some bullies will feel safe tormenting you (as they enjoy that action itself) if they see that you aren't suffering from their actions.
You cannot talk sense to an irrational person. Walk away with dignity, saying you have better things to do with your time. If it continues, stand up for yourself. Whether it continues or not, be sure to stand up for others who are being bullied.;
, Everyone has an inner strength to draw on; the problem with bullying is that many bullies try to make you feel that you lack this strength and that you're less of a person because of this. It's not true; beware the deliberate attempt to belittle you and cause you to feel weak.


Sometimes we think they can take everything we have as a person away from us. Believe that you are stronger than they are, because deep down you are stronger than they are and stronger than they ever will be.

, Try to avoid them in school and social situations. If they take the same route that you do, try a different way; if they can't find you, they can't bully you. Try your best to avoid them but don't show that you are avoiding them. They will usually read this as fear or success, and they will bully you more as a result.


Always walk with a friend; there's safety in numbers. Most bullies will be deterred if people in their camp aren't around. They don't want to get in trouble, and if your friends are around, that could happen.

, This will only please the bully, and they will often chip in with their own ridicule and humiliation to lower your self-esteem. You're just sinking to their level with the target still being yourself.


There is nothing funny about bullying, and agreeing with them – whether it's about you or someone else – is just exacerbating the problem. Jokes aren't appropriate in the situation, even if it feels like they're diffusing the tension. They're really just fueling the fire.

, If accomplished in public, this can elicit laughter from surrounding peers or victims at the bully's expense. This is a bully's worst nightmare, as they are de-throned from their position of power over you. Remember not to show the bully the attention they are hungry for, as this will allow the bully the pleasure of actually hurting others emotionally.


Avoid insulting the bully if they have a history of physically bullying you, since this instigates a conflict you can't win. Instead of exacerbating the situation, walk away. Report this to an authority figure if you believe you are in danger.

, Bullies usually aren't very smart or witty, so you can use this to your advantage. Here are a couple of ideas:


Laugh at everything they say, and the worse the insult, the harder you should laugh. Try to think of it as something really funny and actually laugh. This is undeniably frustrating to bullies, because they want you to cry, not laugh.
Scream a quote at the top of your lungs to their face. You should only try this when they've tread on your feet or in general are doing something wordlessly annoying. There are many good things to quote, such as the first verse of Jabberwocky, songs that have been mostly forgotten, (""I am I, Don Quixote, the Man of La Mancha"") or make up some of your own (""I would like a dollar so I can buy a fish!"") . In this case, random is the key word. The bully might be so surprised that you can cause laughter or, at a minimum, get away. If they think you're crazy, that's okay too!

, Consider Karate, Kung Fu, Taekwondo, Judo, Ju Jitsu, Aikido or something similar. This will boost your confidence, prime your physique and enable you to gain combat or defensive skills. Bullies like to prey on those they perceive as being weaker than them, so developing a battle aura can help deter them. Martial arts skills will also help you learn how not to appear to be an easy target.


You don't have to look like a fighter, just be a no-nonsense type with a don't-mess-with-me aura. It's better to be combat ready and not need it than to be black and blue wishing you could've defended properly.

, Study the surroundings for possible escape routes, hangouts, conflict zones, safe zones, and territorial boundaries. Be aware of the bully's patterns including possible connections, as most bullies have a pack of underlings. Knowing the enemy and the surroundings could mean a lot when evading but, most importantly, during a direct confrontation.Be confident when walking about. Walk with a purposeful confidence and a don't-you-dare-mess-with-me attitude. Walk with your head up looking forward in the direction you are walking and use your peripheral vision to be aware of the people around you. No matter how untrue it feels to you, act confident and stand tall. Everyone will be none the wiser.

, This is very important should you need to fight (which hopefully you won't). You don't need a black belt, just tips on self-defense. Do so with all your strength, and do so without reluctance.


A quick kick in the groin will make the person feel dazed and look embarrassed long enough for an escape. Bullies aren't always used to others getting the best of them.
If the groin doesn't work, try the solar plexus (right below the ribs), or kick a knee to make the person trip.
If the bully is grabbing you or pushing you, believe it or not, it's actually an advantage. Try really hard to keep your balance, grab one of their arms with your left hand and hit their elbow with the other, then using your other hand, push away the remaining arm.
Then when you get your first chance, run to get to a safe place and call for help.

, Know your strengths, weaknesses and goals. Know what you want and what you're capable of. This self assurance can be helpful when dealing with verbal bullies, as their words of insult won’t reach your core. Verbal bullies usually require an audience when dishing out insults and their words are rarely based on what's true but rather what's catchy.


Try to overcome the rumors: tell everyone it's not true and that the bully just wants attention. Turn the negative spotlight back onto them. Point out their bullying tendencies and how incredibly insecure and unhappy they must be to have to pick on others.
These insults and the way this person is treating you has nothing to do with reality, nothing to do with you, and everything to do with them. This is their insecurity and unhappiness showing through. When they're done with you, they'll likely move onto someone else.

, The last thing you want to do is to sink to the bully’s level. While you should definitely point out why they’re bullying and find holes in their argument, never, ever, ever resort to behavior like theirs. That’s just another way of giving them power. It makes you as bad as them.


And if you do, you're about to get in much as trouble as they are. If things do get crazy and the appropriate authorities get involved, no one would know who the actual bully is – you or them.

, Bullies cross the spectrum – some abuse physically, others verbally, while others play mind games and toy with you emotionally. Many bullies use a combination of these strategies. Whatever the type, it helps for you to understand the approach taken by the bully.


Does the person abuse you physically? Aggressive bullies like to hit, punch, kick and pull hair. They will do it without hesitation. Such a bully isn't beyond starting a physical fight, only to blame it all on you or cry that they're hurt and you started it.
Is this person a name-caller, someone who insults you verbally? Taunting bullies are verbally abusive (calling names, making jokes, teasing, etc.).Does the person pretend to be your friend, but then makes fun of you in front of others without warning? This is just one type of emotional bullying. Others include threatening to hurt or break something you care about, doing something to cause you to be ridiculed (such as having a ""kick me"" sign on your back) or telling lies about you to other people to Try to make them hate you. Indirect bullies, sometimes known as backstabbers or gossip-mongers, spread rumors, exclude others, and harass their victims whenever possible.

, Cyber bullies harass other people through instant messaging, e-mail, and any other electronic means. The best way to deal with online bullies is to delete their messages and not read anything they say. Be sure to block the bully as well.


If this is happening to you, it is just as legitimate as face-to-face bullying. Do not hesitate to tell your parents, your boss, a teacher, or the police, if necessary, about your situation. This is not okay and should not be tolerated.

, Consider your parents, school guidance counselor, principal, boss, the police, or someone else who can deal with or punish the bully and protect your safety. It's important that you talk to someone about your problem to get it to end. This is not cowardly of you. This is brave of you to come forward and make yourself vulnerable.


Do not worry about revenge that the bully may take if you report the incident; they will hurt you anyway and appeasing them doesn't solve your problem or anyone else they are bullying. You could also go to tell a good friend – a good friend includes them standing up for you and you standing up for them as well.
If there is a bullying survey in your school always write your name down. Do not be embarrassed. You will probably be asked to talk to someone in private who is very experienced and this can be surprisingly helpful. You might feel very small but in reality you are bigger than the bully.

, Bullies are people who try to make themselves look good. All they want is attention, and they have probably learned their bullying from home or friends. Take that away from them and they have nothing! Since you've experienced the problem, you know how it can hurt, and you know how to help others!


One of the simplest way to help others feel better in the face of bullying is to change their understanding of it. Emphasize to them that bullies themselves are unhappy and frustrated and are trying to have control over their feelings to finally feel good themselves. It’s kind of sad, if you think about it.
If someone comes to you and they're in a situation similar to yours, go with them to report their problem. They'll greatly benefit from the moral support. If they don't have their own strength, they can soak up some of yours.

, Bullying is a real problem. It is not something that needs to be shoved aside and dealt with quietly. Take your issues and talk about them. Ask your school to hold talks or seminars putting it in the front of everyone's minds. Make everyone aware that it happens every day. Only when people are looking for it can they do something about it.


You may think you're alone or that you don't know anyone that's gone through something like you have, but that's likely because those people are too shy to speak up. If you break the ice, you may be surprised how many people join you in your fight.

, It's important to define bullying appropriately, to avoid labeling every negative social interaction as a case of bullying, as some conflict has nothing to do with bullying and may be a sign of normal, healthy relating. Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Both bullies and victims may have serious, lasting problems.

, Something personal can be going on in the bully's life. They need a punching bag to take their anger or sadness out on, and unfortunately, it is you. Don't take this personally. Most likely, it has nothing to do with you.

Choose a cause you care about.,
Decide what you want to sell.,
Write a proposal for your school board.,
Publicize your event at least a week beforehand.,
Ask friends and family to contribute to your efforts.,
Decorate your locker or dorm room door.,
Set up a vibrantly decorated booth or stall.",How to Have the Best School Spirit2," There are plenty of methods to boast your school spirit aside from or in addition to color-coordinating. One of the best ways to do so is to raise money for a school group or cause. Not only will your fundraiser add to the litany of events and community groups on your school grounds or campus, but it will also provide concrete assistance to an organization and let your school spirit be felt long after spirit week has ended.


If you’re a member of a school club or charity group, ask your fellow members if they would like to organize a fundraiser with you. If you’re not affiliated with any groups officially, ask some friends who belong to one if they’d like any help fundraising.
If you already hold a particular charity or cause dear to your heart, consider organizing a stand-alone fundraiser for this group. Even though the proceeds won’t go directly to your school, organizing members of your institution to contribute to a non-school group can build a sense of institutional pride and character.

, Once you’ve determined the cause for which you’d like to raise funds, think about how you’d like to go about doing so. Bake sales, car washes, craft stores, and clothing and canned food drives are all great ways to get people involved and drum up some cash for a good cause.


Just because you’re asking for money, doesn’t mean you have to sell stuff! If your enthusiasm for merchandise is low, consider doing something like a fun run or dance marathon where people pledge money for participants to run a certain distance or dance a certain number of hours.

, If you want to conduct your fundraiser on school grounds, you’ll need to get approval from an official student or governing body first. Using a word processing template or online resource for formatting, gather your ideas and justification for the fundraiser into a brief document which presents your project.


Any good proposal should not only say what you want to do and why, but also how you plan to do it. List any resources, volunteers, and sites you plan to use for your event, as these details will help persuade a deciding committee that you’re capable of implementing your ideas., Once you’ve received approval for your fundraiser, you need to get the word out. The key to effective publicity for a charity event is giving yourself enough advance time, delivering reminders consistently, and using as many avenues and mediums as possible.Draw up some colorful flyers and banners to hang around the school halls or campus buildings, ask your school newspaper and daily intercom announcements to notify students and faculty of your fundraiser, and use your personal social media accounts to spread the word.


Just be sure to clearly tie the fundraiser to school spirit: if people associate one with the other, they’ll be more likely to pitch in once your event rolls around.

, Whether you’re trying to bake two hundred cupcakes, organize a food drive, or collect cool crafts to sell, chances are that you could use some extra help with your efforts! Recruit your friends and family to help in any way they can: for example, ask a school friend to help run the booth for a half hour, have your sister make a few of her patently awesome friendship bracelets on the house, or ask your parents to donate the baking ingredients and kitchen space for your bake sale.


If you have some friends who don’t go to your school, have them help in other ways. They can help you prepare your posters, donate a baked good, or pitch in a couple extra bucks as a gesture of good will.

, Jazzing up your personal space in the school halls with school colors and reminders about your fundraiser will allow you to demonstrate school spirit as well as present some valuable press about your event. Use slogans that remind students that donating to or participating in your fundraiser will also be an act of school spirit.


For example, make a sign that says something like, “Show your support for McKinley High and its drama club by stopping by the bake sale after school on School Spirit Day!” or “Help McKinley High support the local community by donating some winter coats to the drive!”

, On the day of the event, make sure all students and faculty are aware of your event by having a brightly colored center of operations. Even a basic folding table can be made conspicuous and appealing: drape some brightly colored sheets over the table and pin big, glittery signs to it, or set up tripods or easels with signs behind your table and chairs.


If you have enough volunteers manning the booth, send some people out to spread the word around the school grounds. They can pass out flyers with details about where and when your booth is running, or, as long as class isn’t in session, they can make some loud announcements encouraging milling crowds to visit your shop.

Consider activities which would rally and unite people from different circles.,
Gather a group of friends and other students who want to help.,
Obtain approval from a teacher or school committee.,
Ask for prize donations from local businesses or parents.,
Get a teacher or other school official to supervise.",How to Have the Best School Spirit3," Many schools permit and even subsidize free activities for students and staff. These activities get people excited for upcoming events, encourage students to get involved in campus groups, and help students from different backgrounds and ages interact. If you’re interested in revving up school spirit in this way, start out by brainstorming different activities which could get people involved and excited.


For example, you could organize a face painting booth, have a costume or pumpkin decorating contest, or arrange a series of fun competitions such as three-legged races, hoop-shooting, and juggling.If your school doesn’t accept new ideas or activities, consider volunteering for a pre-existing event like the school dance or homecoming parade. You could help distribute flyers, work on creating a float, or help set up equipment.

, You might already have a close-knit band of friends dedicated to helping you pitch and run your activity, or you might need to recruit extra supporters and helpers. Whatever the case, make sure you get interested volunteers to commit to a particular responsibility and a specific number of hours. Draw up a sign-up sheet that lists different roles required for the activity as well as job descriptions for each role, then ask volunteers to sign up under whatever role they’d like to play.For example, list two or three slots under ‘Poster Making’ in order to signal that you need two people to take this role, two slots under ‘Supply Gathering,’ and six under ‘Event Volunteers/Facilitators.’ Also denote the amount of time each role requires so that everyone knows what to expect.

, Once you have enough volunteers to help organize and facilitate your activity, ask a school official for approval. You’ll need this so that you don’t get in trouble for running an un-sponsored event, and also to figure out where and when you can carry out the activity. You can also find out whether or not the school can help you with supplies and other arrangements.


You’re more likely to convince school officials of the validity of your idea if you can show you’ve already done some research and planning. Provide justification for your activity by explaining how your activity in particular would build school spirit, as well as why it’s a manageable task that won’t require too many resources or complex logistics.

, If you’re organizing a contest of some kind, you can drum up enthusiasm by awarding school-themed prizes to its winners.Request donations from your parents, local businesses, or the school principal in order to purchase some official school merchandise.


For example, the first prize for the costume contest can be a hoodie with your school’s insignia on it, second prize can be a school scarf, and third could be a keychain or pendant.

, Since you’ll be bringing diverse people from the school together and wrangling them into concerted activities, you should recruit at least one or two experienced adults to help out. They can judge your contest, shepherd students into the event or into different groups, or just provide an authoritative eye to keep students in line.

Talk to your teachers.",How to Do Well in School with Attention Deficit Disorder1," One major problem that children with ADHD run into when going to school is a lack of focus on work that needs to be done. In order to help with this, make yourself two homework folders. One should be a ""To Do"" folder and the other should be a ""Completed"" folder. In order to keep yourself more organized, take any handout that relates to your homework and place it in the folder. Keep a few sheets for loose paper in the folder as well to keep track of any book work or written assignment that does not have an accompanying handout. Once you have completed the assignment, move it over to the ""Completed"" folder or mark it off the list.


Make sure you check this folder every day. Keep it with you at school and make sure you put all of your assignments in there.
If you have some assignments that you have weeks to work on, think about making a separate folder labeled ""In Process"" to house the assignments that are works in progress, such as research papers or projects. This will help you keep them separate from the day to day assignments that are due.;
, One of the best ways to help your focus is to have everything laid out for you in a particular place. In addition to the homework folders, you need to have all of your school materials in a specific place. This will help you find things and keep track of everything you need for school.


Have a different folder and notebook for each subject. Clearly label the front of each with the name of the subject, the name of the teacher, and what time a day you are in that class. Not only will this help you stay organized, it will also help you remember all the other important details about your class.
If you think you might lose the folders and notebooks if you keep them separate, try using large three ring binders instead. You can keep all of you notes and handouts in the same binder and keep the classes separated with dividers. In this case, label each divider to keep track of where each class is., Small tasks can not feel like achievements at all when you do them every day. In order to make yourself stay more on track, find ways to reward yourself in small ways. If you focused enough to study hard for an exam and made a good grade, give yourself a small treat, such as watching your favorite TV show, going to the movies, or some of your favorite candy. If you see that your good work is rewarded, you will be more likely to work hard and focus on your assignments.


Don't give yourself rewards if you fail to do your tasks. You only want to encourage good behavior., Children with ADHD need consistent structure to follow. If you have a hard time staying on task, try scheduling your weeks before they begin. Over the weekend, make a calendar of the week to come. Put in the hours you are at school, any time dedicated to after school activities, enough time for homework every night, as well as leisure activities. Don't forget to ADHD extra time in for studying when you have a test coming up or time to work on a paper when you have one due in the near future. This will help you stay focused each day and stay on track with your studies and extra curricular activities.


If you have a job, make sure to write down your schedule each time you get it from your supervisor and ADHD it to your weekly schedule. This will cut down on any problems with timing and will help you stay in your boss's good graces., When you have a large assignment coming up, remember to work on it every day. If you put it off to the last minute, it will likely not get done. When you make your schedule, put down some time to work on a paper or project that may not be due for a few months. This will help you stay on top of assignments that are longer and more involved.


Treating them like homework every night will help you stay focused on them and get them done.

, A fidget is an object, such as a stress ball, that can be used to help you concentrate. If throughout the day at school you find yourself antsy or distracted, take out the stress ball or other object that will not interrupt class and squeeze it. Use it to release some of your pent up energy and use it as an anchor to help you focus. Visualize your focus getting clearer with each squeeze of the ball.


Keep this object handy so you can grab it at a moment's notice. If you think it might cause a problem with your teacher, talk to him and tell him why you have it. He should understand and let you keep it as long as you don't misuse it., In class, distractions can make you lose focus, which can cause you to miss important information, learn less, miss assignments, and fall behind in class. In order to prevent this, limit your distractions in class. Don't have anything on your desk except what you need to have out. Try to sit away from friends or people who may distract you. Also avoid sitting near a window or the door to the hall. This will help you focus and stay on track.


If you have assigned seating, ask your teacher to move you to a more appropriate location that will help you stay focused., Lack of sleep can increase the symptoms of ADHD. Being tired can affect your attention span, memory, and problem solving skills. In order to cut down on the symptoms you have at school, get a good night's sleep every night.

, For most people with ADHD, sitting for long periods of time is not possible. In order to make studying more manageable for you, break it up into smaller pieces. Study in 30 minute chunks and then give yourself a five to 10 minute break. Spend the break doing something that will help let off some of your excess energy or a span issues, such as a level on a video game or a quick job around the block. Then once back to studying for another 30 minutes. Repeat until you get your studying done.


Set an alarm for each segment of your activities. This way, you will actually study for the necessary period of time and then only break for the amount of time as well.
If you think you can study longer, try going longer between breaks. If 30 minutes is too much at once, go down to 20 minutes. No matter how long you study, try to work up to a longer session of studying if you can. This will help you increase your concentration skills and make you a more effective studier., All of these methods may not come easy to you at first. ADHD can make it hard to put some of these things into action, but know that once you do, they can help you become a better learner and do better in school.


Instead of trying to implement them all at once, try one at a time.
Get someone to help you start these methods. Ask a family member, close friend, or teacher to help you incorporate these changes into your school and home life.

, If you are having issues with your school work, ask your teacher or teachers for help. Each has likely dealt with a student with ADHD before and will understand your need for Additional assistance. If you are having trouble concentrating, ask them if there is a way for you to change your seat. If you have issues when you take exams, ask your teachers if you can take your test in another room, if you can wear headphones, or sit away from other students to avoid distractions.


Your teachers may also be able to structure your assignments more rigidly to help you do them in smaller chunks.
Don't be embarrassed to ask and make sure you are respectful. Your teachers are there to help and they all want you to succeed."

, Instead, work with co-operative methods.—The more able should help the less able in group settings, not by overbearing or demeaning, but by providing gentle guidance and supplying behaviour to emulate. Primary emphasis should be on each individual self-identifying the most helpful, supportive strategies to use with others.

, Allow the inner satisfaction of achievement to blossom. Squish any tendency within the group to belittle the achievements of others.—Return focus to positivity and the small actions which build and strengthen core confidence of each individual.


Sell the strategy to empower the least contributing individual by strengthening confidence in his or her core competency to the point at which they are indeed one of the more productive contributors in the group. If each member is lifted, the power of the group grows exponentially and, with it, the power within each individual is amplified.

, As an adjunct, avoid favouring any person or group on the basis of bias or prejudice. Try to level the playing field by affording no one an unreasonable advantage or any undeserved opportunity.


Talk about difficulties and problems openly as group.
Talk about individual opportunities for individual purposeful endeavor. To highlight the concept, have individuals take turns doing different jobs in the group and in the class.

, Strive to empower the students to build co-operation and communication skills. Work on the model of building a co-operative which honors and utilizes the unique insights and abilities of each team member.

Recognize that fairness is not just one thing or the other. Many express the view that treating everyone the same with no differences is one kind of fairness while others feel that treating each person as an individual and, therefore, providing multiple opportunities for success to each person is fairness of another kind.

, These are called core intelligences by Howard Gardner, i.e. different learning modes. The theory has been widely argued in the psychology and education communities--whether or not the intelligences are just names for talents or personalities.

Respect diversity and work on unifying the community. At the same time, provide ample opportunity for each student to improve his or her skill set and to build understanding of the unique proclivities of each and every individual in the group.
Revel in the diversity of individual difference. Encourage the group members to highlight areas of strength in their teammates, e.g., knowledge, talents, abilities, and understanding. Seek to promote identification of resonant skills and activities—things that seem right and come naturally—both in themselves and in others.

, Afford to each team member multiple, diverse chances for personal fulfillment and opportunities to use skills for the greater good.

Get involved with the teachers.,
Seek Additional help.,
Look into an individualized education plan (IEP).,
Obtain help from IEP Transitional Services.",How to Do Well in School with Attention Deficit Disorder2," Parents should discuss a variety of topics with your child's teachers, such as effective rewards and consequences, how to establish effective homework routines, how they will communicate on a regular basis about problems and successes, or how parents can mirror what teachers are doing in the classroom for greater consistency. For some students, success will be obtained relatively easily by establishing consistent schedules, routines, and homework communication methods as well as utilizing effective organizational tools such as planners, color-coded binders, and checklists.Unfortunately, even with outstanding cooperation and effort by the adults, many children still will not succeed and will need more intensive services available through the school or district special education department. In some cases, rigid teaching methods by inflexible teachers are the issue. In these cases, parents must seek administrative support or look into changing teachers, changing schools, or exploring special education options., In most school systems, children qualify for free special education services based on one of two basic reasons. Either they have a qualifying disability or they have fallen far behind their peers academically. Once parents become aware their child is not succeeding in school and they feel additional help is required, which is an opinion usually made in conjunction with the classroom teacher, parents may request a special education evaluation, a request that should be done in writing.


This is the first step to securing assistance that can take various forms, from minor accommodations like extra time to take tests to self-contained classrooms with teachers and aides who are specially trained to deal with children who exhibit behavioral disruptions. Once qualified, a child with ADHD may have access to other school-based services, as well, such as riding home in a smaller bus with extra staff who supervise students more closely than a lone driver is able to do.

, After providing documentation of your child’s ADHD diagnosis and completion of a special education evaluation that shows the child’s disability is interfering with his education, you will be asked to participate in an IEP conference. An IEP is a formalized document created by school staff and parents that spells out the academic, behavioral, and social goals of special-ed students. It also outlines how results will be determined, specific interventions that will be used to achieve the goals, and any other issues that deal directly with your child's educational needs.


It also lists decisions made concerning self-contained classrooms, percentage of time in mainstream classrooms, accommodations, discipline, testing, and any other special accommodations.
The school is legally bound to follow the guidelines laid down in the IEP, so teachers failing to follow the IEP open themselves and the school up to liability. The school also is required to invite parents to regular IEP conferences to evaluate the progress of the child and the effectiveness of the plan then make adjustments as needed. Once a child has an initial IEP, it becomes easier to establish special education services when changing schools or transferring to a new school district.
Never sign a prefabricated IEP. Each IEP should be personalized for your child's particular situation. Never sign anything until you have gone over the fine points with the teachers and principles., When children on IEPs hit age 16, the focus of the paperwork changes toward transition services. Up to that point, goals have focused on achieving academic, social, and behavioral success in the school setting, but when any child turns 16, the focus changes to needs that relate to what your child will do as she moves beyond the secondary school setting. The IEP Transitional Services will work with your child to help achieve this.


All students with ADHD will benefit from career guidance, which includes familiarity with job applications, resumes, and interviews. Many will need special college preparation, which encompasses searching for the right institution that will support specific needs, obtaining accommodations for testing, and deciding how to address special needs during the application process.
High school students with ADHD may be behind their peers in life skills areas, which is also addressed at this point in time.
Experts also recommend talking directly to teens with ADHD to rein in their natural anxieties and reassure them they will not be kicked out of the nest when they hit a magical age. You need to help assure your child that parents, school staff, and possibly therapists will work together with them to insure she has the skills she needs to survive and thrive as she transitions into adulthood."

To cut through the heap of work you have to do and to make it seem more manageable, start planning out your time accordingly. Conquer a little bit every night so you're never left with a tower of work to climb by tomorrow.


Start with the hardest things first. You don't have to finish the entire task now, but just getting the ball rolling will make it seem so much more manageable when you go to finish it in a few days.Take little opportunities to get work done. If you're waiting for the bus, whip out those flashcards. When you go to review tonight, that 5 or 10 minutes of prep will help you finish that much sooner.;
, If your locker looks like a tornado blew through it, or your study desk at home is really just a horizontal closet without hangers, it's no wonder school stresses you out. It's just too hard to figure out what you have to do, much less do it. So take 15 minutes to put everything where it needs to be and organize it so you remember. When you don't spend all night searching for your syllabus, you can concentrate on the actually important stuff.


Everything you need should always be within arm's reach, not everything you have. If you never use white out, it doesn't need a prominent place on your desk. If you always use highlighters, make sure they're in your top drawer. Be logical about the importance of the materials you're using. If you don't need 'em, don't let 'em clutter your studying area (and your brain).

, Compared to just about everything else, studying is a drag. And who wants to study after school, which was essentially hours and hours of studying, just not at home? However, if you get it over with, you'll be much happier in the long run. Instead of it already being 9 PM and you haven't to stay up late, you've gotten it over with and can relax with some TV and Candy Crush.


Your brain will probably be less tired, too. The information will be fresh in your mind from school that day and you'll still be wide awake since it's only 5 PM. This means studying will be more effective, which could reflect in more effortless, better grades.

, If you have a 200-point presentation on Romeo and Juliet due in two weeks, you'll probably busy resisting the urge to run for the hills. Instead of focusing on the entire thing, break it up. Spend one day making an outline, finding natural divisions where you can break the task up. Spend the next making your poster. Then tackle writing your interstellar space version of Act I one day, Act II the next, etc. It's not one giant project – it's a whole bunch of little, manageable ones.


This goes for time, too. Don't study for 3 hours for European History on Thursday – study for 30 minutes each night all week. If you try to attack too much at one time, your brain will just sort of shut down, the information won't be as effectively processed, and your morale will be worn out to boot.

, All of the above steps have a common element: not procrastinating. Think about it this way: if you had to lose 20 pounds, and you had one month to do it, would you want to wait until the last few days to start dieting? Nope. That's a recipe for disaster. Think of your grades the same way – you can't put tasks off and expect good results and peace of mind.


The sooner you're on top of your game, the more you can breathe. You'll feel in control, and that's really what stress is about. Whether you have a million things to do or just a few things to do, it's feeling in control that's the kicker. And if you don't procrastinate and hop to it, that sense of control will be a lot easier to get a hold of.

, Let's be honest: kids in school are getting more and more stressed at an earlier and earlier age.They're worrying about college in grade school, in addition to trying to be a rock star at virtually everything. When it all starts stressing you out, take a breather. Maybe you won't get into Oxford. Maybe you won't be football captain. Maybe you will get an A- this semester. And life will go on. It's school – not the Hunger Games.


If you're trying to do it all, you may need to take a step back and abandon an extra-curricular or two. School is hard enough as it is – you can't be an athlete, a musician, an ambassador, a volunteer, and a thespian on top of it. What's one thing you could live without? The extra free time may make everything else that much easier.

, Stress at school can come from a number of different places. Here's a few things to consider:



Peer-induced stress. This is when stress comes from your classmates. It could be because you feel they're outperforming you, you feel you're just different from them and won't be accepted, or even because they're bullies.

Parent-induced stress. This happens when your parents don't make reasonable demands of you and your academic performance. They are constantly harping on you to get better grades and be an ideal student.

Teacher-induced stress. This occurs when you don't jive with a specific teacher, or when you feel like your teachers are disapproving. Hopefully this only occurs with one teacher, but it could occur with many.

Self-induced stress. This kind of stress comes from the inside. You've put demands on yourself to try to be ""good enough"" or ""valuable"" in your own mind. This can be one of the easiest and hardest types of stress to tackle.

, Taking those four sources listed above, what do you do to make them better?



Peer-induced stress. In this situation, you could try to change classes or pick up a different after-school activity with different people. Worst case scenario, you could change schools.

Parent-induced stress. This involves a very honest conversation with your parents that could possibly also involve your teachers or school counselor. Communication needs to be established between the two of you that doesn't make you feel negative – and they need to know that that's how their view makes you feel.

Self-induced stress. This involves a change of thinking. It's easy because you're in control, but it's difficult because mind-control isn't exactly easy as pie. You have to make a conscious effort to think more positively and more globally, realizing that the world is much bigger than your performance at school.

, If school is getting to you and you feel about an inch away from pulling out all your hair, your school counselor may be a natural source of good advice. What's more, he or she may be able to point you in a new direction, giving you opportunities for destressing that you didn't even know existed (like taking a class online, or getting credit for volunteering). They can also be the go-between for you and your parents or teachers.


If you don't have a relationship with your school counselor already, there's no better time than the present. They're there to help you – and they could even be a network connection for schools in the future.

, Sure, it's easier said than done – but once you do it, you'll never go back. A positive mindset can keep stress at bay, making even the most difficult (or the most boring) of tasks seem okay. After all, you have so much going for you, and life is going to be awesome once this pile of homework is done (and eventually, it will be). With a new, fresh outlook on life, nothing can stop you.


If this is particularly difficult for you, start trying to be positive in just 10 minute increments. When you wake up in the morning, think of a few things you're excited about and grateful for to put you in an upbeat mood. In time, this will become a habit and be virtually effortless.

, Everyone needs a passion to keep their inner fire burning strong. We all need something that makes us happy. If life is all work on no play, you'll be on a one-way ride to misery and self-resentment. So make whatever it is you love a priority. When what you love is a part of your life, everything else that's stressful can just fall into the background.


Don't feel guilty about it, either. Paul Allen, Michael Dell, Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, Bill Gates – none of them graduated from college and they turned out pretty okay.Your performance in school isn't the end-all-be-all of your life, so don't devote 24/7 to it. Spend your best years enjoying them, not resenting them.

, Do your brain a favor and stick to the same routine every school day. Get home, grab a snack, sit down to study, take a Facebook break, sit down to study some more, and then go party like it's the weekend. When you have a plan to stick to, it's easier to relax. There's no longer the question of, ""When am I going to study for this?"" or, ""When do I have time for that?"" With a routine, you'll know exactly how your time fits together.


Humans, in general, like to know what to expect. It's why we turn to others for their opinions and recommendations. It allows our brains to relax and calm down, accepting the fact that we can only take in so much information at a time. If you give yourself a routine to stick to, your brain will be able to quit being on high alert and take a mental breather.
Keeping a schedule can help you tackle one hurdle at a time, and as a result, feel more in control. Get a schedule from a supply store or make one yourself and hang it up in your room. Write down everything you need to do in order not to miss deadlines – and this way you can let it leave your brain; you've got it down on paper!

, Students should at least sleep 7 to 8 hours a day to make it easier for them to cope with stressful situations, and some even need around 9 hours a day to function at 100%. Not only will this help with you staying alert, focusing, and likely getting better grades, but it will also result in you being less stressed-out, less irritable, and not as tense.


Research shows that not getting enough sleep isn't just about being tired. It also leads to memory problems, decreased alertness and performance, a poorer quality of life, and even makes you prone to injury.If you want good grades, you need sleep. Resist the urge to cram – it won't do you any good. Studies show that students who cram actually do worse than students who opted for sleep instead. Your memory of the night before won't work anyway when you're a zombie during the test., Exercising at least 30 minutes a day can help alleviate stress, tension, and boost confidence.It releases endorphins – those little happy-makers in your brain that keep you feeling good. So get on the treadmill, lift some weights, or just dance it out. Sometimes your mind takes cues from your body, and this is definitely one of those moments.


This is a good excuse to do those more mundane chores, too. Offer to take Fluffy for a walk, wash your dad's car, or get to meticulously scrubbing the tub. Even little sessions of calorie-burning are helpful – and you may be able to make a buck off your parents while doing it.

, Everyone needs free time to do things that make them happy and keep them stress-free. If you're going, going, going 24 hours a day, you're going to burn out. After a studying session, make sure you spend some time making yourself feel good: listen to relaxing music, take a long bath, watch a romantic movie, do yoga, or meditate. Relaxing for at least an hour per day can help you get rid of that stress building up inside.


It doesn't have to be something stereotypically ""relaxing."" If playing an intense, zombie-destroying video game helps you relax, do that. If reading a chilling horror novel gets you in the zen zone, do that. If you enjoy it and it makes you less tense, what's not to like?

, Take a step back and remember to have fun with friends. Without socialization, it's easy to go a little crazy. If you don't, you'll wind up a little miserable, which is ultimately demotivating for you and bad for your grades. Having fun can actually keep you going.


If you feel like you ""don't have time"" for being social, turn it into something academic. It can be helpful to have a group study session where you can talk and joke, but also get things done. It will be entertaining and instructional at the same time – the best of both worlds.

Know Your Phone.,
Set Phone to Silent.,
Pick a good spot in class.,
Know your Teacher.,
Put Phone in area where it is easily accessible.,
Make Phone non visible.,
Look up occasionally while texting.,
Put your phone away.",How to Text Message in Class," An important part of texting in class is being able to do it without looking. You will need to know where all of the buttons are on your phone, and how to use them with out looking. You will also need to navigate to the Create New Message screen. This is just memorizing the key order you have to use to get there, or even setting a shortcut straight to the Create New Message input box. All of this amounts to being able to looking as though you're paying attention to the teacher, when in fact you are texting under the desk. If you are confident that you know how to use your device, then proceed to the next step.;
, You'll need to turn all sound off, or at least put it on vibrate. That means key-tones, ring-tones, alerts, everything. You can usually do this by pressing the 'Volume Down' button until it reads 'Vibrate All'. You will be caught if audio goes off and you may get into severe trouble. If you are not aware of this then do not take the risk of texting in class for it is very likely for key-tones to go off.

, An important part of texting is where you sit. Always make sure that you are sitting where the teacher can't see you, or if someone comes in that is an administrator that they can't see you. If you think to yourself, can people see me? move and don't take any chances. Preferably sit in the back of the class. Since teachers will teach at the front or sit at there desk in the front, it will make it hard for them to notice if you are texting. Try to avoid texting in class if you sit in the front of your teacher's desk.

, If your teacher is bitter, and dislikes you then DO NOT text in class. If you have an easygoing teacher, then texting in class will be easy, thus this is the best time to text message during class time.

, Putting your phone in your pocket will not always be easy. If you feel that you are constantly sitting up to get your phone out of your pocket, then you are being very obvious. Try wearing a jacket so that you can put your phone in the sleeve, or the pocket in the center. Putting your phone in the front zipper of your backpack may also be helpful.

, Put jacket in lap or cross your legs. If you have it in your jacket then the teacher will not be able to see it since it will be tucked into your sleeve. Another method to try is crossing your legs, if you cross your legs then you will block the view to your phone and teachers will not suspect that you are texting. Do not begin testing if phone is in sight, you may begin when you are sure that it is not visible for teachers.

, If you stare at your phone while texting, then your teacher will realize that you are not paying attention and become suspicious. Look up every two seconds while texting if you are not willing to text ""blindly."" If this step is completed, Congratulations, you can text in class.

, Once you have completed talking to your friends, your social life will have improved, and you will be a better all-around person. All that is left is for you to hide your cellular device in the front pocket of your backpack, or put it away in your pocket of your backpack. Once you have done this you are safe and your process of texting in class is know complete.

Make a professional list.,
Get some friends.,
Ask your class.,
Make signs.,
Ask your parents.,
Be determined.,
GOOD LUCK!",How to Create a School Petition to Change a School Rule," To make a petition list that looks professional so the principals know you mean business what you should do is go on Microsoft Word and make a table that takes up your whole page (3 across and as much as you can down, with space to write full names) or you can use Google Docs (Newly Re-named Google Drive) or use any equivalent program. At the very top left hand corner in your table type: Names. So people can easily know what it is they're supposed to write and don't forget a title so people know why they're signing their names.;
, Ask your friends if they agree with your idea and if they'll sign your sheet, friends are always the best way to start your petition and can help you in the long run with organizing things.

, Ask your teacher if you can tell the class about the petition your doing and tell her why, she/ he will probably say yes because they believe it's good that you are starting to show some initiative, however if you ask her in the middle of class and interrupt everything she/ he may be less kind so maybe after class stick around with a few friends and ask her when she isn't busy.

, Make a big colorful sign you or your friends can hold before and/ or after school to try to get random passersby to sign your petition or attract other students to. If you do this prepare to be answering the same questions more than once, and don't get frustrated be patient.

, You can ask your parents if you can get them to maybe spread a sheet or two around their work or even ask some of their adult friends to sign or if they're on something like a parent council at school if they can get other members to sign.

, Honestly your principal probably won't even look at anything under 50 signatures so don't be let down if after the first day you only have 3 there's always another day of asking tomorrow. A principal can probably not turn down anything that's signed by over half of the schools population, because that means majority of parents and students agree with you.

, Happy signing!

Do not miss out and keep attending your classes.;
, It is very important for you and the other classmates around you to concentrate on the topic you are studying. When you have an assigned homework at the end of the unit and are studying for it you will understand the questions and the assignment given to you.

, Your teacher and determined classmates will encourage you to revise the topics you have been learning for the past semester or two to prepare you for your final exams; do not ever start an exam without revising the subjects you are requested to revise on, otherwise you could end up giving yourself a headache, a high stress level and, to make matters worse, a very bad set of grades.

, If you have completed a set of exams during the day, relax yourself and regain your energy by having some water to drink and a healthy snack to eat, don't drink anything with high amounts of caffeine, as this type of drinks will make you feel run down, even when they make you feel active at first, the same applies to snacks. Do not eat anything with too much sugar or fats, try to eat a piece of fruit or a granola bar.

Even if you think the story has been twisted, acknowledge the parts that are true. If you appear cooperative, you will have an easier time telling your side of the story. There is always something you could have handled better. If you were being bullied and got angry, you might be in trouble for losing your temper. First admit that you need to work on regulating your temper, then explain about the bullying.


If you have been accused of something you didn't do, stay calm. It is frightening when an authority figure has the wrong idea about something, but if you panic you will have a harder time explaining the mistake.
Ask for a teacher you trust, as well as a parent or guardian, to be present when you are being disciplined.;
, Even if you disagree with how your discipline is being handled, apologize for anything you could have done better. Admitting that you feel regret is a sign of maturity. You may even be punished less if you show that you understand what you did, are sorry for it, and plan on never doing it again. You might apologize to your teachers, school administrators, and fellow students.


Apologize to your parent or guardian as well. They may have to lose a day of work or deal with other unpleasantness as a result of you being in trouble at school.

, You may find yourself depressed and discouraged after getting in trouble at school. It can be easy to get further behind on schoolwork during this time, especially if you are suspended. You may also find yourself grounded as a result of being in trouble at school, which will leave you with extra time on your hands. Try to use this time to catch up on your schoolwork, and work ahead if possible.


Review your notes from the semester, and study for upcoming tests if you can.
Get ahead on your reading. Start whatever book you have coming up in English class, or read the next few chapters in your textbook.
If you have any big projects coming up outside of school, such as college applications, take this time to do some research.
You are less likely to be punished again if you are perceived as being responsible and organized.

, For a more serious punishment, such as a suspension or expulsion, your school needs to follow certain rules. Look up your district's Code of Conduct, or Discipline Code, online, and call into a district office to get a longer explanation of disciplinary procedures. If you think you are being suspended unfairly or that rules are not being followed, you have the legal right to contest your suspension.Most schools distribute some kind of student handbook at the beginning of the year that includes Student Conduct rules, and post the rules around the school. If your school has not published or distributed school rules, you may be able to argue that you didn't know you were breaking a rule.
Even if you have already gone through your suspension, it's worth proving that you were suspended unfairly, as it can get the suspension removed from your record.

How have you been feeling, generally? Has anything changed recently in your life? You might be acting out in some way because you are under some sort of strain. Problems at home, bullying at school, heartbreak, manipulative friends, and difficulty with schoolwork can all lead you to make choices that can harm you.


Write down everything that is happening in your life, and how it makes you feel.
Talk to a parent or a guidance counselor about any stress you may be going through. If you have frequent issues with another student, talk about it with your counselor.

, If you can point to a reason you got in trouble at school, address that reason. For example, if you are being pressured by friends, find friends who aren't trying to control your behavior. Switching to a different elective or joining an afterschool program can be a way to meet new people. If you committed plagiarism because you were afraid of failing, form a study group or ask a parent or guardian about getting a tutor.

Ask for advice on reaching your goal, and make a realistic schedule that will help you reach your goal.


If your goal is to get into a particular college, for example, look up what the average grades and standardized test scores of admitted students are. Aim to get slightly higher grades than their average. Take a pre-test to see what your scores are, and sign up for a class if they aren't up to the standard of your desired college.
Make friends with your teachers. Not everyone is going to be able to appreciate you, but the likelihood is that most of your teachers want you to succeed. Even the teacher who got you in trouble might secretly be looking out for you.
Ask for help when you don't understand the homework. Pay attention in class. Confide in your teacher: when your grades pick up, or you have some other triumph, tell them before or after class. They'll see that you are serious about your future.

, You will have an easier time in school if you are getting 9-11 hours of sleep a night, eating at least three meals a day, and getting at least an hour of exercise daily. If you don't like sports, try taking long walks, dancing, skateboarding, or biking. Sign up for a self-defense class, a yoga class, or organize low-key sports activities with your friends. Build habits that will allow you to maximize your concentration during study time, and blow off steam at other times.

Interact with your teacher.,
Interact with your classmates — when the time is right.,
Take knockout notes.,
Keep your body alert during class.",How to Stay Awake During School1," Though interacting with your teacher may sound like the last thing you want to do when your eyelids feel like sandbags, keeping up a rapport with your teacher before and during class will surely help you stay alert. Not only will this make you less likely to drift off, but your teacher will be impressed by your participation.


Greet your teacher when you walk in the door. Establish a level of communication before class even starts. This will also keep you from immediately slouching in your seat as soon as you walk in the door.
Sit near the front, near your teacher. Though this may sound like a bad idea, you'll be more motivated to stay awake and participate in class discussion if you're closer to your teacher. Your teacher's voice will also reach you more easily.
Answer questions during class discussion. Make a habit of raising your hand to answer questions during class discussion. Tell yourself you have to answer at least three or four questions per class. This will force you to pay attention to the class discussion so you can chime in.
If you're confused about something, don't be afraid to ask a question. If you have the kind of teacher who is open to questions, pose a question or two when you're unclear about a certain concept. This will make you engage further in the class discussion.;
, Your classmates can also help you stay awake during school. While you shouldn't be chatting with your peers when your teacher is talking, there will be opportunities to use your classmates to help you stay alert. Here's what you can do:


Talk to a classmate before class starts. Instead of slouching in your chair and slipping into half-slumber, talk to one of your classmates about the homework, or even his plans for the week.
Take advantage of group work. If you're working in groups or partners, be an active participant to stay alert.
Sit near the students who participate. Though you don't want to sit by a chatty student who can distract you, if you sit near someone who participates a lot, his/her voice will jolt you awake frequently. This will also keep you from sleeping because you'll know that your teacher will be looking in your direction often.

, In most classes, you'll be spending a lot of your time taking notes. While this can sound like a plan for falling asleep even sooner than you intended, if you make the most of your note-taking, you will be much more likely to stay alert. Here's how to take notes that help you stay awake:


Take very detailed notes. The more detailed your notes, the more carefully you'll have to focus during class. If you're falling asleep, listening will be impossible.
Read over your notes from time to time. Using the ""reading"" part of your brain instead of the ""listening"" part will help you switch gears if the classroom is starting to feel too monotonous.
Use different colored pens and highlighters. Use different pens to write about different parts of the class lecture, or just switch pens because you feel like it. Take out your highlighters and use them from time to time to keep awake.
If it keeps you awake, doodle in the margins of your pages. Just try not to tick off your teacher.

, Keeping your mind alert is only half the battle. To truly stay awake, you have to make sure your body is awake too. Though you won't be able to run around in circles or do jumping jacks in the middle of your Spanish class, there are a few small things you can do to keep your body alert.


Sit up tall in your chair. If you don't slouch, you'll be less likely to collapse into sleep.
Roll your shoulders.
Roll your head in a circle to get the kinks out of your neck.
Stretch your wrists.
If you're really struggling to stay awake, pull down on your earlobes or even pinch your thighs or forearms. In a desperate moment, you can even lightly bite down on your tongue.
Suck on a cough drop or a peppermint, if your teacher doesn't mind. Though gum is probably not allowed in your school, chewing it will snap you awake.
Cross your legs and bounce the crossed leg.
If your body is still asleep, excuse yourself and walk across the hall for a drink of water or take a quick trip to the bathroom and splash cold water on your face.
Stay hydrated. If your teacher allows it, sip from a cold bottle of water and your body will feel more alert.

Here are some snacks to keep around:


Nuts, such as cashews, walnuts, or almonds.
Fruit, such as apples, bananas, or grapes.
Veggies, such as carrot sticks or celery. You can carry a little bit of peanut butter in a container to dip the fruit in.
A granola bar.
Unless your school has a super-healthy vending machine, avoid taking a trip there. Most vending machines are stocked with foods that are too sugary or salty to have a positive effect on your energy level.

, Take advantage of your lunch break and give yourself the fuel you need to make it through the rest of your day. You should eat a healthy and balanced lunch. Your snacks should keep you from getting so hungry that you overeat and then immediately feel tired again. Here's what you should do:


Pack your lunch, if you have time. This will ensure that you can eat something healthy, and it will also give you time to digest your food instead of spending half your lunch period waiting in the cafeteria line.
Avoid greasy, sugary, or high-fat foods.
Have a healthy salad with fruit and nuts, or a sandwich with whole wheat bread. Have a yogurt or banana on the side.
If you need more caffeine, have some black tea.
When you're at lunch, try to interact with your friends as much as possible so that your mind is engaged. Take the time to laugh and be silly and to help your mind relax.

, Though you may not have a lot of time in between your classes, you can make the most of the time you do have by moving around as much as you can in between classes. Being physically active is a way of telling your body that you're not ready to go to sleep yet. Here's what you can do:


If you get to school early, take a lap or two around the hallways to get your blood flowing and your heart rate up. Or you can even walk a lap around your school to get some fresh air.
If you have time left over when you move between classes, take the long way or walk up and down the hallway.
Take the stairs whenever you can.
If you get to the cafeteria early, take a walk around the room — just don't annoy your teachers in the process.
If you're in gym class, don't complain about it. Instead, make the most of whatever sport you're playing that week. Not only will this boost your grade, but it will boost your energy level as well.

, When you're passing in between classes, you should focus on getting some extra physical exercise, but there are a few other things you can do to make the most of your time away from the classroom. Here are a few of them:


Strike up a conversation with a friend. The more excited you are by the conversation, the more alert your mind will be.
Take a quick trip to the bathroom. Splash cold water on your face.
Get to your classroom early and get some fresh air from an open window.
Open your locker. Even if you only need one book, opening your locker will keep your hands busy and your mind alert.

Eat foods that are high in protein, like eggs, ham, or turkey.

Eat fruits and vegetables. You can also drink them in a healthy vegetable smoothie.
Eat food with carbohydrates, like oatmeal, granola, or toast.
Eat yogurt. Avoid too much milk because it can make you sleepy.
If you're really tired, try some caffeine. If you're still in school, it's likely that you're not used to caffeine, so try it in low doses. Black tea is best, and a small cup of coffee will help you as well. Avoid soda or energy drinks unless you're extremely desperate for a quick pick-me-up, because they will make you crash after a brief spike in your energy level.

, Having a great morning routine to follow every day will help you be in the right mental and physical state to begin a long day of school. Being able to get up in the morning without problems will put you on the right footing to begin your school day.


Get enough rest the day before. Most teenagers need between 8-10 hours of sleep. Studies have shown that 6 hours or less is not good for your overall wellbeing, even if you think it is. If you oversleep or don't get enough sleep, you're setting yourself up to be tired for the rest of the day. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every night.
Wake up at least an hour before school. This may sound like a pain because school already starts so early, but being more alert when you enter school will help you stay alert. If you roll out of bed and head straight to the school bus, you will still be half asleep when your day begins.
Take a cold, refreshing shower. Turn the lights on bright and sing to yourself. This will help your body wake up.
Stimulate your mind. Read the morning paper or even surf the Internet for an interesting article or two. This will help get your mind moving.
Listen to your favorite pump-up song.

, Feeling mentally prepared for a day of school will go a long way in helping you be mentally alert for the eight or more hours that you will spend in school. You should do whatever you can to make sure that you're going to school feeling prepared, positive, and ready for the challenges ahead

.

Be prepared for school. Do all of your homework the evening before so you don't end up staying too late doing your homework, or rush to get it done in the morning and then end up crashing from working too fast.
Have a game plan. As you're waking up, think of the classes ahead of you and the tests, lessons, or events in store. Knowing what your day will look like will help you stay alert for it.
Feel positive about going to school. This can sound difficult, but you should give yourself at least three reasons why you're looking forward to going to school, such as going to your amazing English class, or even catching up with a friend during lunch.

Try doodling.,
Ask a friend to help you stay awake.",How to Stay Awake During Class1," If you are participating in class and engaged in your learning, you will not want to sleep.

Sit close to the front of the classroom.,
Move around during class.,
Avoid body positions that make you drowsy.",How to Stay Awake During Class2," One way to stay engaged in class is to sit near the front of the classroom.

Take notes.,
Do extra research.,
Develop a routine.,
Get enough sleep.,
Eat right to maintain your brain.,

Exercise to relieve tension.,
Practice paying attention.",How to Pay Attention in Class," The most basic thing you can do to help you concentrate in class is to get away from the distractions that are keeping you from focusing. There are lots of things that might be taking your attention away from the lesson. Try to be more aware of what you’re doing when you stop paying attention. Once you know what it is, you can find a way to get rid of it.


Distractions include items like a computer, a phone, and small items that you can play with. Distractions also include things that are around you, like a friend, an annoying classmate, or a window.
Physical removal is the best way to deal with a distraction. So, for example, if you know a classmate is distracting you. Try sitting somewhere else. Your teacher will understand and will probably be more than happy to help you move seats.;
, You have to try to keep your brain from wandering out of the classroom. No daydreaming! Keep your mind here, in the present and save thoughts about other stuff for later. This is hard to do but if you can make the change, it will really help you a lot.


Things you might catch yourself thinking about include: games, what you’re doing after school, your boyfriend or girlfriend (or lack thereof!), your friends, your family...even fantasy stuff like books you'd like to read or places you wish you could go.
You’ll have to learn to manually refocus your attention. Catch yourself and then make yourself think about the lesson again. Eventually it becomes a habit and you learn to daydream less.
This means that even if you’re thinking about another aspect of the class, like the test you have coming up, you’ll want to stop and refocus on what’s happening right now. It’s important to do things like think about tests but if your mind is wandering then you’re not absorbing the information that you need to learn at the moment.

, Pay attention to what your mind is doing. If you catch yourself thinking about anything other than what’s currently happening in the lesson then you’re going to have to manually refocus your attention. Try saying back everything that your teachers says in your own head and really emphasizing the important bits.


One thing you might want to practice is building your ability to focus. Test yourself by trying to do a challenging task while listening to loud, distracting music. Focus is a skill which needs to be exercised and developed, just like any other.

, Everyone learns in different ways. The way your teacher teaches may not be the best way for you or there may be ways to make class even better for you. Set aside some time to talk to your teacher about ways they think might help you get more out of your class.


Ask about learning styles. Some people learn better using pictures while some people learn better using sounds. These are called learning styles and there are lots of them. Ask your teacher to help you figure out which learning style helps you the most and how those types of lessons can be fit into your class.
Try making customized lessons or assignments that are more interesting for you to learn. You can also ask your teacher for extra credit or side projects which help you learn the same lessons but in a way that works better for you. If you're serious about learning and you're willing to put in hard work, your teacher will probably be willing to help you come up with something.

, When you're more motivated, you'll find you have an easier time staying focused. Of course, if your teacher and your class can't or won't make you more motivated, you'll have to work to create that motivation for yourself. This can be frustrating but it'll be worth it: you'll get the benefits of education, whether people want to help you along or not. There are lots of ways to make yourself motivated and interested in learning and what you do will depend on who you are.


You can try finding some aspect of the subject that is interesting to you. This can make the rest of the class more interesting because you'll feel more like you're building a base for the stuff that you want to learn. For example, maybe you don't really like your history class but you do like medieval knights. You can try to imagine how all of the history that you are learning ties back to medieval knights, and you'll find that that makes it easier to focus on what you're learning.

, Sometimes you just need to be in the right mindset before you can pay attention. Before class starts, try looking over your homework, reading from your textbook, or looking at the previous day's notes. This can get your brain into ""class mode"", so that you can have an easier time focusing.


Preparing yourself by getting everything that you'll need and arranging your desk can also help you focus. This will cut down on distractions, like needing to borrow a pencil because yours is out of lead.

, By changing your environment, or the things around you, you can actually really help yourself concentrate. This doesn't just mean getting rid of distractions, although that can certainly help too. Just sitting in a different spot may help you focus by changing what you can do from where you sit. Sitting in the front, for example, can help you focus because you'll know the teacher is watching you. Sitting away from your friends can also help, because you won't be physically able to talk with them as much.

, Participating in class can also help you focus. Participation keeps your mind engaged and focused on the lesson because you can't just drift off or think about something else. Anything you can do to participate, from asking questions to getting in to group projects or discussions, can really help you.


Ask questions. A good way to participate in class is to ask questions. When you have a question about something you don't understand or the teacher said something and you want to know more about it, raise your hand and ask. Even just focusing enough to listen for things you might want to ask questions about can help you pay way more attention.

, Taking notes can help you focus on what your teacher is saying, even if you don't think you'll need the notes to study from later. If you can use the notes then even better! As your teacher talks, make an outline with a few side notes on the really complex topics. You'll find yourself focusing better before you know it.


If you don't know how to take notes, we've got you covered!


, Sometimes you lose focus in class because you can't understand what your teacher is saying. This is normal and understandable. If you do extra research so that you can better understand your lessons, you might have an easier time paying attention. At the very least, learning outside of class can make up for the fact that you're having a hard time paying attention. You can find more information on just about any subject in various places online. You can even get some subject help from wikiHow.


For example, if you're struggling with math, try going to Math is Fun or Wolfram Alpha to get more math help.

, Not paying attention really is a bad habit. Just like any other habit, you can break it by replacing it with other habits. Try to create a system where you focus in class, making that time just for school and learning, but give yourself times of relief where you can have lots of fun. By teaching your brain what time of the day is for what by sticking to a routine, you can train your brain to pay attention.

, Sleep is incredibly important for staying focused while you’re at school. If you stay up too much or if you sleep in a way that doesn't fully rest your brain, there’s basically nothing you can do to stay focused during the day. Take a hard look at your sleep schedule and see if there are any changes you can make.


For anyone under 12 years old, doctors recommend about 10 hours of sleep. For anyone older, eight or nine hours of sleep is recommended. However, some people need more sleep and some people need less. You’ll have to experiment.
Keep in mind that oversleeping can also make you tired. You might be sleeping too much, if you increase your sleep and still feel tired halfway through the day.

, If you don’t eat enough food, or if you miss out on essential nutrients for too long, your brain will start to suffer. Much like not getting enough sleep, if you don’t eat right or enough then there’s not much you can do to help yourself concentrate. Take a look at your diet and decide if you need to adjust how you eat.


You need to get lots of veggies, a little fruit, healthy whole grains, and plenty of lean proteins. Good options include: kale, broccoli, spinach, apples, citrus fruits, bananas, brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal, fish, chicken without skin, and turkey.
Avoid caffeine or at least use it carefully. Caffeine can help some people focus but for others it makes them too jittery to pay attention to anything for very long. You also risk a caffeine crash.

, Your body needs lots of water to function properly. When you don’t drink enough, you’ll end up with headaches and problems focusing. How much is enough will depend on your particular body; everyone is different. However, a good way to gauge if you’re drinking enough water is to take a look at your pee. If it’s pale, you’re drinking enough. If it’s dark, bring on the hydration.


Drinking actual water is a good idea here. Soda, commercial juice, and milk are all not very good for you and the sugar in the soda and juice can actually make your problems focusing even worse.

, Some people are very physical. Their bodies need a lot more activity to be happy. It also just takes a lot of concentration to pay attention in class and this can get your brain and body all wound up. If you find yourself feeling antsy in class, try to get some physical activity in between classes or during your breaks. This can help calm your body and brain down so that you can focus. It can also help you wake up if you're feeling tired.


Try jumping up and down or running in place. You can also jog around the building or play a game with your friends if you have the time.

, Paying attention takes practice. That’s just how it is. Your brain is like a muscle and it needs to be exercised to make it strong in the areas where you want it to work well. You’ll have to practice paying attention if you want to increase your ability to pay attention.


One good way to practice is actually to meditate. Sit and try to empty your mind while focusing only on one simple thing, like breathing in and out from your nose.

If you show up prepared, you’ll have a more active interest in the class because you already have a headstart on the material., Taking notes will help you pay attention to what’s being taught, while also giving you a chance to translate the message into your own words. This can help you learn the material faster., If you find that you simply can’t focus in class, or you get bored because the teaching style doesn’t suit your learning style, record the lecture so that you don’t miss important information. When you’re studying on your own, you can go back and listen to each class if needed.

, Some people have an easier time paying attention if they have something to do with their hands. Consider buying a fidget spinner or stress ball that will keep your hands busy, so that your mind can zone in on the lecture.Be discreet when you use your fidget spinner or stress ball so that you don’t distract anyone else in the class.

, When you find your attention slipping or boredom setting in, remind yourself that learning is important and that you want to succeed. Try repeating a few motivational phrases in your head, such as ""Be here now,"" ""Be in the moment,"" and ""Knowledge is power."", Head into class with an optimistic attitude. If you walk inside expecting to be bored, you probably will be. Convince yourself that you'll learn something new and interesting in each class, and pay close attention so that you do., To keep yourself motivated in boring classes, give yourself a reward. For example, after every boring class you manage to pay attention in, get yourself an ice cream, go to the movies, or allow yourself some free time to be with friends. Rewards will provide incentive for you to pay attention each time you have class., It can be hard to pay attention in a boring class, but if you force yourself to participate by asking and answering questions or joining in on group discussions, you’ll stay focused.Challenge yourself to ask at least 3 questions or contribute 3 discussion statements per class.
Engaging with your teacher and your classmates with questions and thoughts of interest to you may help steer the class in a more interesting direction.
Teachers and professors often reward class participation with higher grades and extra credit, so it’s worth the effort.

, If you find class boring, it might be because you’re having trouble understanding the material and keeping up with the work. Consider hiring a tutor or attending your teacher’s office hours to improve your understanding of what’s being taught.


You’ll find class is more fun if you’re able to follow what’s going on.

, For really boring, hard classes, like chemistry or physics, strength is found in numbers. By joining a study group, you’ll meet like-minded students who probably find the class as boring as you but who are determined to do well and help keep each other accountable in class.


Check your school’s bulletin boards and hallways for posts about study groups. If your class or school doesn’t have one that suits your needs, consider starting one up yourself!

, If class feels like agony to you and you don’t know why, talk to your teacher about it. Be polite and open, but don’t be afraid to state your frustrations and ask for help with the material or being more engaged.

, It’s impossible to pay attention when you have to use the bathroom, so make a stop there before class starts., If you’re worried about the math test you just took or you are overwhelmed by the big history paper you were just assigned in another class, you’ll feel distracted and bored all day long. Enter your classroom with a clear head and an open mind.

This is especially true when you need to listen and take notes at the same time. Keep food and drinks stored in your bag or locker for after class and focus all your energy into learning.Even if you feel like you're able to concentrate and eat or drink at the same time, the noise, food type, and extra movement may affect those around you, so it's important to be courteous., Being tired during class can be a huge distraction and make it hard to focus.

This approach has the added benefit of helping you when it is time to study or helping a friend who is absent from class.

, Studies have shown that people who doodle on their notes tend to pay more attention and retain the information better.Alternate between drawing and note taking.
Nonsensical doodles may be just as effective as illustrations that connect to the content of the notes.

, The time will seem to go by faster if you take advantage of the social environment of the classroom to engage with your fellow students and your teacher.Ask questions about the content. You will stay focused and time will go faster if you raise your hand and ask questions or if you answer questions that your teacher poses.
Introduce a controversial remark or idea. If you think that the content of the lecture is boring, try to find the way to introduce a controversial spin. The ensuing debate between students of differing opinions is likely to be lively and entertaining.

, If the subject matter is boring, try listening to a lecture for other reasons. Here are a few suggestions:


Note your teacher’s annoying speech habits (like saying “umm”) and keep tally marks every time one occurs. Have a running competition each day to see if there will be more than the day before.
Try making a word cloud manually. Write frequently occurring words from the lecture in a cloud on a piece of paper, making more frequent words larger and more prominent on the page and less frequent words smaller.
Try listing only the nouns or only the verbs that your teacher uses. Then look for secret subliminal messages hidden in the patterns of her language use.

Learn to make the ""snare"" sound with the tip of your pen.,
Make the ""cymbal"" or ""hi-hat"" sound by clapping the long edge of the pen against a hard surface.,
Try writing out your beat patterns.,
Join the online pen tapping community.,
Experiment.",How to Pen Tap," You can use two pens--one in each hand--or you can hold a pen in one hand, and use your the fingers and heel of your free hand to support the beat. Different pens will make slightly different sounds: heavier and harder pens will make a slightly deeper sound, while flimsier plastic pens will give you a lighter tapping sound. Make sure to use pens that are durable enough to stand up to heavy drumming.;
, You can pen tap on almost anything, but some surfaces will sound better than others. Pick something smooth and hard to practice on at first: a desktop, a hardcover book, or a binder.


If you drum on a hollow object, like a box or a garbage can, you'll get a deeper, fuller sound as the hollow space amplifies your taps; however, this might also drown out the clarity of the individual taps. Solid surfaces like concrete and stone, on the other hand, will barely amplify your taps at all.
Experiment with new surfaces as you get better at pen tapping. Drum on wood, metal, plastic, brass, porcelain: tap surfaces with your pen and see how you like the sound. Be careful when making beats on fragile surfaces, such as glass or ceramic--you might like the sound, but be gentle so that you don't break anything valuable.

, Hold it firmly enough that you can tap with it, but gently enough that you can adjust it for different sounds The tip of the pen should be facing toward the surface that you plan to tap. Wrap your other fingers lightly around the pen for support.


Don't completely encircle the pen with your fingers; leave one long edge clear to make the ""cymbal"" sound. When you release the pen to make a ""cymbal"" sound, grip it with only your thumb and index finger so that the other fingers don't interfere with the beat.

, While you're holding the pen, thump the heel of your hand--the meaty part of your palm where your thumb meets your wrist--against a smooth, hard surface. Pen tappers call this sound ""1"".


You can make the bass sound (1) with either hand, and you can quickly alternate two bass sounds for a double-bass effect.
Use the bass sound to keep the beat. It's the deepest and most powerful of the pen tapping sounds, and it takes longer to execute than the pen taps themselves. Use it sparingly, for emphasis, and try to alternate bass sounds with the higher-pitched tapping sounds for an interesting beat.

, Tilt the tip of the pen (the end that you write with) and tap on a smooth, hard surface to make a clean, high-pitched ""tap"" sound. Think of this sound as ""2"".


The tip that you write with is usually heavier: it's loaded with a spring and other supports, in click-top pens, and it's typically where the cap of the pen fits. Use the heavier end for a more powerful snare, or the lighter end for a daintier snare.
Be careful not to strike your fingers against the tapping surface while you make this sound. It should be crisp and clear. If you only have one pen, however, you can use the fingertips of your free hand to simulate sound ""2"".
This is the quickest sound, in the sense that you can tap a lot of these out in rapid succession. Use speedy, rhythmic taps to make your beat more complex. Try alternating quick taps between two pens. You can use these to make a drum roll.

, Release your thumb from the bottom of the pen, and use your remaining four fingers to slam the pen into the table.Use your thumb and index finger to quickly pick the pen up again. This is sound number ""3"".


Make sure to keep your fingers clear of the table when you release the pen. The easiest way to do this is to keep them on the top edge of the pen, opposite the table. Ideally, this sound can be almost as crisp and clear as the snare ""2"" sound.
Think of this sound as an intermediate between the ""snare"" and ""bass"" sounds. It's slower and more powerful than the snare ""2"" sound, but it's much more high-pitched than the bass. Alternate sounds 1, 2, and 3 to add variety to your beats.

, Remember: bass = 1, snare = 2, and cymbal = 3. Beat notation may vary between different communities of pen tappers; the 1-2-3 format is just an easy way to remember and write out the types of taps that you can use.Start by trying out a simple beat pattern. Repeat: 1-2-3-2 (bass, snare, cymbal, snare) at a tempo that sounds right to your ear. Try to keep the space between each tap consistent each time you repeat the pattern. For example: 1 (medium rest) 2 (long rest) 3 (short rest) 2, repeat. When you can repeat the 1-2-3-2 pattern over and over again, with the same consistent amount of time between certain taps, you've got a beat.
If you have trouble keeping a beat, just keep practicing. Try to internalize the beat, to get into the ""flow"" of it, so that you don't need to think about it to keep it going.
If you're totally new to percussion, try an even simpler beat: 1-2, 1-2, 1-2. Make the bass sound with the heel of one hand, and follow it with a snare tap from a pen held in your other hand. Try to repeat this simple beat five times in a row with consistent spacing between each tap: 1.. 2. 1.. 2. 1.. 2. 1.. 2. 1.. 2.

, Read pen tapping forums, and watch pen tapping videos for ideas.Make yourself familiar with the sound of pen tapping, and try to copy beat patterns that you like. Search YouTube for ""pen tap"" or ""pen beats"". You'll encounter a number of people who are making unique beats--even some who are rapping over their beats or combining them with other sounds.


You may encounter a few YouTubers, such as cartinbredan los and Shane Bang, who upload a number of videos dedicated to pen beats. Watch the videos of pen tappers that you admire, and try to pick up pointers from their style.
Search the web for ""pen tap beat patterns"". Pen tappers have collected their favorite beats across the Internet, usually written out in the 1-2-3 format, and you can try out the beats that you find. Some beats are easy for beginners to learn, and some require complex rhythms that may be better suited to advanced pen tappers.

, Try tapping new surfaces, layering complex beats, and even asking your friends to collaborate with you. Remember that you don't need to stick to the 1-2-3 formula, and that the best pen tappers often find their own ways to make their beats sound unique.


Try alternating surfaces within a beat: for instance, make your bass sound deep by thumping the wide side of a hollow box, but make your snare sharp and crisp by tapping the tip of the pen against the corner of the box. Try making a high-pitched, ringing cymbal/hi-hat sound by tapping the side of a glass with your pen.
Try incorporating scratching--dragging your fingers or your pen across the surface for a second or two--to add another dimension to your beats.
Try using your phone to record yourself tapping out a beat, then tapping, rapping, or singing over that beat as you play it back.

You can also disable push notifications temporarily or permanently.Even turning your phone over or keeping desktop tabs open in the background can be distracting. If you really want to beat these distractions, eliminate them.

, Keep yourself motivated to stay on task by creating rewards for yourself. Especially if you’re resisting something, create a reward around completing it. For example, reward yourself with a television show, sweet treat, cup of tea, or guilt-free internet time.If you’re tempted to turn to a distraction, keep your reward in mind.

, Keep your desk free of clutter and other items that may distract you. For example, if you have a stack of to-do items on your desk, put them in a folder in a drawer instead. Keep your phone off of your desk so that you don’t reach for it. Keep your desk simple and distraction-free.Don’t keep books you might want to read or games on your desk.
You may also find it helpful to change your location now and then to help improve productivity. Try going to a different area of your office to work, or go to a coffee shop or the library for a total change of location.

, If you get distracted by extraneous things or projects, write a to-do list. A to-do list can keep you on task and motivated to complete your goals. You’ll know each item that needs to get done and when it needs to be completed. Writing down tasks means that you stay on top of deadlines, don’t forget exams, and complete important tasks.You may wish to prioritize your to-do list by having the most important items at the top to complete first.
If you get distracted, refer back to your to-do list to stay on task.

, Perhaps you start a project, then get interrupted by something else and forget about the project. Assign your time into blocks and stick to the schedule to stay focused. Using a schedule can help you realize what you can accomplish in a certain amount of time and can ensure that high priority tasks are completed. Plan for unexpected tasks or situations by setting up some contingency time. Have a general plan for each week, then specify your schedule more succinctly for the next day.For example, if you have one hour between in-person appointments or classes, assign that time to certain tasks. Work on an assignment for 30 minutes, make phone calls for 15 minutes, then spend 15 minutes freely.
You can also try breaking down your goals into small manageable tasks to help you make progress. For example, instead of making a goal to clean the kitchen, you might break that goal down into tasks, such as sweep the floor, load the dishwasher or hand wash the dishes, wipe down the counters, and take out the garbage.
Look into digital tools that might help you to break down your goals and work towards them., If you think that working six hours straight is the best way to maximize your productivity, don’t be surprised if you crash midway through or “veg out” with a distracting activity. Divide your time so that you spend some time working and some time resting away from work. For example, for every hour of work, take about a 20-minute break.Instead of letting distractions occur throughout the day, schedule in time to relax and check social media, watch funny videos, or do other mindless things.
Your breaks should be something you enjoy. Switch up your activities such as taking a walk, checking social media, or getting a snack.

, Small interruptions can make a big impact, so it is best to avoid them altogether.For example, if you respond to each email as it comes, engage in many conversations with coworkers throughout the day, and check your social media notifications each time you get an alert, you’ll likely waste lots of time throughout the day. Instead of doing each small thing one at a time, do them all at once.Do small tasks in a block of time, like 10 minutes, twice each day.

, Set aside time each day to devote to emails. Perhaps you do some emails in the morning and afternoon for 15 minutes at a time. Keep your email closed and notifications off. Then, spend some interrupted time reading and sending emails.Don’t feel bad if you don’t respond to emails immediately. Most emails are not urgent and can be responded to within a matter of hours.

, If you can’t figure out where all your time goes throughout the day, consider tracking your activities one by one each day for an entire week. You might be surprised at how much time you waste or the number of distractions that occur. Once you track your activities, you can begin to notice patterns of when you tend to get distracted and how you distract yourself.Once you recognize your own patterns, you can begin to change your habits. For example, instead of spending 30 minutes on social media, you can take a 15-minute walk instead.
Providing yourself with deadlines may also help if you find that you frequently get sidetracked during the day due to a perceived lack of a deadline. For example, you could set a deadline for what day and time you want to have finished a project for school or work and sue this to help motivate you.

, If you work better in a quiet environment, plan to get to work a bit early or stay a bit late. Maybe your office, dorm room, or library becomes noisy or crowded throughout the day, so start your work while the atmosphere is quiet. Without distractions from other people, sounds, or movements, you might find an hour or two of increased productivity.If you work better in the morning, get to work a bit earlier. If you work better at night, stay a little later to complete your work. Either way, distractions will lessen and you can get some quality work done.

, Lots of sounds can be distracting at work and grab your attention. If sounds keep you from staying focused, consider wearing headphones. You might listen to music to help you stay on task or use noise canceling headphones. If you choose to listen to music, don’t play songs you want to sing along to or that pull your attention away from your tasks. Instead, stick to instrumental music without lyrics.If you listen to music at work, don’t plug your headphones in all day. You might be perceived as rude or miss some important interactions.

, Some people feel more accomplished when they work on several tasks at once. However, multitasking can decrease your productivity. Stopping and starting tasks can take away time and energy that could better be spent focused on one task. When completing tasks, do one at a time and don’t start another one until the first is completed.If you feel like you want to start another task, take a break instead.

, If you use distractions as a way to avoid something, you might have symptoms of anxiety. Maybe you have a big deadline coming up and instead of working toward it, you avoid the stress by distracting yourself. Think of your solutions and how to remain productive despite feeling anxious.Use calm breathing to help yourself feel more in control and less anxious.
If you feel anxious or nervous about something, talk back to your fears rationally. Ask yourself, “Can I complete this in the time I have? Am I blowing this out of proportion?”
Keep in mind that resisting the task will make it much harder to do than if you engage with it. Try to immerse yourself in the task and you will finish it much faster and with less of a struggle.

Think about your weekend.,
Bring games.,
Make the most of emojis.,
Draw clothing on tiny pieces of paper and hold it up to your friends or teachers bodies while closing one eye.,
Run one of your earbuds through your sleeve and listen to music.,
Use wordplay.",How to Overcome Boredom at School1," If there is an outing you want to organize, a movie you want to see, or a crush you want to “bump into”, stretches of boring class time is great for planning it.


If you have access to your phone, you can text your friends, look up events near you, and organize rides and carpooling.;
, If you are extremely comfortable in a class, you can bring a small and un-disruptive puzzle, like a crossword, sudoku or small Rubik’s cube.


This can be a good time to build skills as well-- you can pick more challenging crosswords and more challenging number puzzles as you get more advanced in your distraction skills.

, If you can get away with using your phone in class, you can always text, but sometimes there’s nothing left to say, even to your best friends. At this point, it can be fun to start playing games using emojis.


Play pictionary. Try to get your friend to guess a phrase or situation by communicating it entirely in emojis. Try to use themes: describe a movie, a celebrity, or a country entirely in emojis.
Play connect four or tic tac toe using emojis. This game takes a lot of time and a lot of concentration, and it’s on your phone. This is best to do in a lecture-heavy class that does not require very much participation, and where blatant texting will go unnoticed.

, Make them wear a funny hat or give them a parrot and an eye patch. This can be done with speech bubbles as well. Instagram it and get famous.

, Music will still allow you to concentrate if you need to, but is distracting enough to make class go faster.

, If you use some of what you’re hearing in class, you can go off on a tangent without having to actually think of anything new.


Make puns using the most-used words in class and think up memes for them. Write a rap about how boring your class is, or about one of your classmates.
Replace the most commonly used vocab words with funnier ones, and swap them out in your notes so that it looks like you’re taking notes about something ridiculous. If you write down a code for your invented words, these will also function as notes.

Draw while you take notes.,
Do homework for your other classes.,
Write a joke for every paragraph (or half a page) of notes.",How to Overcome Boredom at School2," Doodling helps you kill time, but is not so distracting that you will be unable to tell what is going on in class. Bring a notebook and a pen wherever you are, so you easily can open the notebook and kill some time.


Doodling as you take notes, or making doodles about your notes, will actually help you remember what you learned in class, as well as make the class more interesting.It will make your notes more distinctive, and you will be able to remember more of what happened during the discussion.

, Some classes are so slow that you can do homework while keeping your notes open. This will decrease the amount of time you spend doing boring school things by doubling up.


If you have printouts, these are easy to hide underneath your textbook for the class you are in. If you understand the material in class before your teacher finishes lecturing about it, you can read ahead and finish your homework for that class.

, Finding jokes in the lesson can help you settle in with the material and start to enjoy it, and it’s an easy thing to do while you take notes.


Start with puns, as these are the easiest form of jokes. They are also unapologetically bad, no matter how good they are, so you don’t have to worry about being funny. “Washington? He’s lucky if he’s a Washingpound!” It’s bad, but it still took time to think it up. These also have the benefit of being possible captions for your doodling.

Challenge yourself to join in on class discussions.,
Connect school subjects with your interests.,
Talk to your teacher.,
Make studying easy for yourself.,
Read ahead the night before class.,
Put your phone away.",How to Overcome Boredom at School3," It may seem counterintuitive, but participating in class discussions is one of the only ways to engage in class without getting in trouble.


Fear of being wrong is often a reason that people do not join in on class discussions. Don’t be afraid to be wrong. You are in school to learn-- your teachers won’t get upset with you for being confused or remembering things wrong.

, If you have an interest in sports or music, physics are heavily involved in those things. If you have an interest in art or drawing, geometry and chemistry are quite visually engaging. Do you like video games? That’s 100% math and science.


You don’t have to do extra work-- you can relate your studies to your interests without it if you ask a few questions, or just look at things a little bit differently. With a few google searches, however (for example, “Math in music”), you can find entirely new ways to relate your interests to what your teachers want you to know.

, If you are bored in class because you already understand the material, you should let your teacher know. Your teacher can advise you on how to switch to advanced classes, or help you gain access to more interesting material.


If you are interested in the subject of your class, but bored by the class itself, you can request additional, more interesting readings. You can ask for extra projects, or think of unorthodox ways to fulfill assignments.

, Take notes, and keep them in order. Record your homework in a planner, and record any extra events that will cut into homework time.


When taking notes, challenge yourself. Try to write everything on the board or screen, or try to write everything in your own words. Make an illustration for each bullet point, or try to say everything in as few words as possible. Challenges will make your notes more memorable, and your note-taking more interesting.

, When you already know the facts, class discussion won’t seem like a waste of time. If you have had more time to absorb the material, you can bring up questions that you have about it, or find ways to relate it to your life, or even other subjects at school.

, As interesting as it may seem to keep updated on texts and social media, the truth is that constantly checking your phone makes you more bored. People who use their phone to avoid what is in front of them are more bored in school ‘’and’’ at home. If you get rid of the constant stimulation on your phone, the things that are actually around you will be more interesting. You will be able to take notes and avoid having to cram later. Eliminate notifications for your apps. It’s not like you’re going to forget about the apps that you really care about.
Use a passcode to get into your phone, and change it up if you already use one. This will make you think twice about checking your phone.
If you find yourself checking your phone without thinking about it, just turn it completely off for the duration of class. "

, Perhaps there is an issue of you not liking some classes but loving others. This can result in feeling bored during the dull classes but feeling energized when you're interested in the topic.


Is the subject matter too hard? Sometimes boredom is a way of deflecting the need to work harder or to ask for help.
Is the subject matter too easy? If you feel that you've been there, done that and want to be challenged a lot more, you will be bored really easily.
Is the class using a teaching method you find uninspiring? For example, the use of worksheets all the time can lead to boredom because nothing else is used to mix up the variety.

, There are times when you just want to be bored because you can't be bothered with the class. It's that simple, and you need to ask yourself if that is the best approach to your learning and future.

, If you are in a class, the first thing you should do is to pay attention. Try reviewing what you learned by asking yourself questions about the chapter or lesson your learning about, try to understand it more.

, If your boredom is a result of not understanding the class materials, seek help. The whole point of education is to learn, not to behave as if you know what you're doing when you don't. If you ask for help, teachers view you as motivated and willing to learn, not as stupid. You might also ask your parents about getting a tutor, if the gaps in your knowledge are quite large. A tutor involves one-on-one learning and most of the time, you'll find this results in much faster learning and easier understanding, allowing you to catch up quickly.


If any teacher implies that you're stupid, then it's time to see someone about the teacher's approach to teaching, not see this as a reflection on you. Any person who has the sense to ask for help deserves to be helped.
Study more effectively. There are plenty of online guides for improving your study methods so that you understand the subject matter better and know how to improve your scores.

, If you feel that the work level is beneath your capability, ask if you can be moved to a more challenging class, or even to change your year level. This will require your parent's involvement and there will need to be proof that you can work at a higher level. Begin by talking to your parents, then have them arrange meetings with the school.

, For example, if all you get is worksheets all the time, ask your teacher if it is possible to learn in other ways, such as through reading as a class, watching videos, doing experiments or visiting places, etc. It might be that your teacher hasn't realized that there is an overload of one style of presenting the material to you as a class, and simply drawing attention to how it's not working might result in a change for the better.

, That's fine, it's part of being human and it's what helps you learn how to be creative about overcoming the boredom. This section sets out some quick fix ways to overcome your boredom until the next class. Just do your best not to be a source of disruption for others!

, Try reading your favorite chapter in this lesson. Do not also read your book or a nearby book that you may have. Try to hide the book somewhere so your teacher doesn't notice. If your teacher ends up noticing, just say it's a class book and you're studying for another subject (eg. science).

, Make a card for your mom or dad telling how much you love them. Maybe write a poem, haiku, or a limerick. Try writing a story about yourself and something you'd like to do.

, Think about your family and friends. Did you have something you were supposed to remember? Has anyone been acting strangely? Have you finished your chores? Think about the present, past, and future. You might want to think about what you want to be.

, Try drawing your favorite sunset. Or maybe you want to draw your best catch? Express your feelings in your pictures, as this will make your pictures more interesting.

, Find someone close by. In a whisper, say ""Hey, what's up?"" or something to meet them. Don't say it loud because the teacher might get mad at you.

, If you are reading from a textbook, silently slip another book or piece of paper in your book. Make sure to switch places when the teacher is coming around.

, This is risky because if you are caught, you can have it taken away. Sneak a game into your desk, and then, with the volume down, play your game or text someone.

, If you have a handheld radio that you can easily slip into a pocket or hold discreetly, then you can listen to a baseball game or listen to a song. This works best for people with long hair.

, Take a small piece of paper and fold it into a piece of origami that you can quickly unfold and pretend to be taking or looking at notes. Try to remember one to use.

Give the letter to your teacher.",How to Write an Apology Letter to a Teacher," Whether you made a mistake or forgot to do something you were supposed to do, state what you did and that you know it was wrong. Reflect on why what you did was wrong before you write out your apology.If you’re having trouble understanding why what you did was wrong, talk to your parents, the principal, the counselor, or another teacher. It may also help to think about how your actions affected your classmates.

, Say exactly what you did and apologize. For example, say, “I’m sorry that I tried to copy my friend’s quiz,” rather than “My behavior last week was wrong.” , Don’t try to figure out what your teacher is thinking or to put the focus back on them. When you apologize, focus on your actions and feelings.For example, say, “I know that you were speaking to the class, and I should not have been talking to Alex while you were speaking.”

, It’s tempting to minimize your blame or explain yourself with an excuse. Maybe there really is a great reason for why you acted the way you did, but bringing it up in your apology will only undermine your efforts because it shows the teacher that you don’t feel totally at fault.If you feel like your behavior was caused by an outside factor, such as a new medication you are using, set up a time to talk to your teacher, either with or without your parents. At the meeting, explain your situation to your teacher, who will understand. This is a great option if you know that the medicine may cause the issue again. For example, if your medicine makes you drowsy, then your teacher needs to know that you may fall asleep.

, Blaming the teacher will only make the situation worse. When you put the blame on the other person in an apology, then it becomes about you, not about them. It also shows them that you don’t think what you did was wrong because you think it’s their fault.Blaming the teacher also includes saying something like “I’m sorry if you felt like I disrespected you yesterday when I shouted during the test.” Saying “if you felt” places blame on the other person for how they feel. It shows them that you don’t think you did anything wrong but instead think they overreacted.A better way to say your apology would be like this: “I’m sorry I disrespected you yesterday when I shouted during the test.”

, Now that you’ve realized that what you did was wrong, think of ways you can avoid that behavior in the future. How you plan to be better will depend on what you did.Think about what you could have done instead.If you were talking during class, then you could have been taking notes instead. If you got into a fight, you could have used your words or should have found an adult to help you resolve the issue.
If you made a huge mistake, such as shoving a teacher, then you want to make it clear that you will never do it again. You could say, “Instead of shoving you, I should have stepped back and asked to go get a sip of water to calm down.”

, When you apologize and promise to do better, you need to make sure that you can follow through. It’s tempting to say what you think the other person wants to hear, especially when you’re in trouble, but if you can’t keep your promise, then your apology will come under doubt.


Don’t promise your teacher that you’ll never nod off in class again because that’s a hard promise to keep. Instead, promise that you’ll stop playing video games past your bedtime, you’ll eat breakfast, and you’ll keep your head up. These are all completely doable tasks.
You don’t have to “promise” anything. Instead, try saying, “From now on, I’ll raise my hand and wait for you to call on me when I want to speak in class.”

, Briefly summarize your lesson to show your teacher that you’ve grown from the incident.If you’re struggling to figure out what to write, think about why what you did was wrong, and that will help you figure out what you learned.
You could say, “I learned that it’s rude to talk while the teacher is talking.”

, “Dear Mr./Ms. (Name)” is a standard way to open any letter, but if your teacher has taught you something different, then use that.


Choose the right salutation. When you open your letter, make sure that you address it to your teacher with the correct form of Mr./Mrs./Ms./Miss.
Avoid being too informal, such as writing, “Hey Miss Smith!”

, Begin your letter by showing your teacher that you value them. This will set a friendly tone for your letter and will show the teacher that you care.


Write something like, “Thank you so much for always being there to help me with my work. I’m glad to have you as my teacher.”
You could also say, “Thank you for planning such fun lessons for us. I know that you put a lot of time into helping us learn, and I’m glad I get to be in your class.”

, Describe what you did or didn’t do so that your teacher knows what you’re apologizing for.Be specific. For example, say “I’m sorry that I used an inappropriate word during class yesterday” instead of “I’m sorry about what I did in class.”Be concise in your explanation. Keep your summary of the events to no more than four sentences. Your teacher should be familiar with what happened.

, You should explicitly use the words ""I am sorry for..."" or ""I deeply apologize for..."" to make it clear that you are admitting your errors and seeking their forgiveness. Tell your teacher that that you know that what you did was wrong, and that you will take steps to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future., Write “Sincerely” or “Thank you,” and then sign your name.

, How you fold your letter will depend on the size of your envelope. The most common way to fold a letter is to imagine the letter divided into thirds.


Fold up the bottom third. Line up the edges and press down to create the fold.
Now fold the top third of the page over to complete the fold.
Your letter will look like a rectangle that is slightly smaller than a standard business envelope.

, Seal the envelope and write your teacher’s name on the front.

, When you next see your teacher, hand them your letter. Try to do it before or after school or the class period when you have them. Avoid raising your hand and doing it during class, which will likely cause a disruption.


If you absolutely cannot face your teacher, then place it on their desk.
Be prepared to explain the contents of your letter in person.

For some issues, there might be more effective ways to fix what’s wrong. For example, if you lost your coat on the playground, you should check in the office’s Lost and Found rather than addressing the issue in a letter to your principal.


Before deciding to write a letter to your principal, ask yourself a few questions. Is this issue important enough to ask my principal about? Is there someone else who could help me with this problem? Can my principal do anything to help solve my problem?
Other people who might be able to help you solve a problem include your parents, your teacher, the school secretary, and the school guidance counselor. If you can’t decide who would be the best person to ask, try making an appointment with your guidance counselor and ask their advice.;
, Whether you’re writing a letter to your principal about a bully, a difficult teacher, or a bad school policy, it is important to think about what the problem is and why it bothers you. You’ll need a clear understanding of the issue to write an effective letter. Make a list of reasons why you think the issue needs attention.

, In your notes, jot down ideas about why the issue affects you or people you know. For instance, perhaps you think there's not enough time to eat lunch. Flesh out why that is a hardship: you rush through your meal and never finish., You can type your response on the computer or write it out by hand. The main goal here is to just start writing so that you have something to work with. You can revise and perfect it later.

, You need to let your principal know right way who wrote the letter s/he is reading. Begin with an introduction that identifies who you are and why you are writing to your principal.You can write something simple like, ""My name is Sam Jones. I’m in the 8th grade, and I am upset about the short lunch period.""

, The body of the letter should specify your complaint. This is where the gloves come off. Write in detail about the problem. Explain how it affects you or people you know.

, What is the point of writing this letter? What action do you hope your principal will take when s/he reads your letter? This is your desired outcome. You need to be clear about what you hope will happen as a result of your letter being read. If you don’t tell your principal what you want to happen to fix the situation, they will think of their own solution and it might not be what you want.


For example, if you are writing to tell your principal that your lunch period is too short for you to finish your meal, your desired outcome might be that they extend the lunch period by 5 minutes to allow more time for eating. Or maybe you could suggest that they allow additional bathroom breaks in the morning before lunch so that you don’t have to use your lunch time for a restroom break.

, Round off the letter by recapping the important points in a few lines. Ask the principal to arrange a meeting to discuss the issues raised in your letter. Sign your name and identify your homeroom so the principal can reply.

, Correct the letter for a final version and make two copies, one to hand in and one for yourself.


If you submit a handwritten letter, make certain it is legible. This may mean re-writing the letter once you have made all the corrections you want to make. Use your best handwriting for this letter., Your letter should be polite and mature. Remember that you are addressing your principal (who is kind of like your boss!) and you should address them in a respectful way.


This is also important because people are usually more willing to help you if you ask them nicely instead of being rude or demanding.

, No matter the content, a sloppy letter with lots of mistakes will be taken less seriously than a well-written letter with very few mistakes. Be sure to avoid small mistakes in grammar and spelling – like spelling the recipient’s name correctly.


You should also date the letter on the day you turn it over to your principal.

, When you are revising your letter, it can be helpful to step away from it for a few days so that you can see it with fresh eyes when you start working on it again. You will catch more mistakes and allow your brain some time to come up with more creative ideas.

, Another person will usually be able to catch mistakes that you miss in your own work. After all, you wrote it, so you know what it’s supposed to say. It’s very easy to just skim over small mistakes because you know what you’re trying to say. An outsider can pay attention to what is actually on the page and spot errors you might have missed.


Asking an adult to read your letter is a good idea because they will probably be able to help you correct any written mistakes you made and to look at more complex issues in your letter like the tone and the logical sequencing of your thoughts.
Asking another student to read your letter would be good too because they can help you decide if your request is reasonable within the context of your school’s rules and regulations. They will have a good working knowledge of the situation since it is their school too. But they might not be as good at catching grammatical mistakes as an adult would be.

, If possible, take it personally to your principal. If not, leave it with the school office or another teacher to pass it on.


Make sure the letter is sealed inside the envelope before you leave.

, Go to your principal’s office and ask him/her if they have received your letter. If you directly approach the principal s/he will probably be willing to talk.If you haven’t heard back from the principal in a week after you deliver your letter, set up an appointment with your principal to discuss the issue in person., If you have not received a response in a week, follow up with a note asking for a response. You could also send your principal an email asking for confirmation that they have received your letter and requesting a timely response., You never know when you might need a copy of this letter again in the future, so make sure you keep a copy for yourself with your other valuable documents.

Tell your teachers about your hearing loss.,
Practice lip-reading.,
If you can pick your seats, try to sit on the end of the rows, assuming that is how your teacher organizes the desks.,
Discuss potential solutions with your parents and teachers.",How to Understand Your Teachers in School when You Have Hearing Loss," Be upfront, and explain that you want to do your best so you can understand the lesson.
, If you're good at reading lips, you may be able to understand the teacher this way. You can practice by watching movies and trying it on family members., Sound projects to you better this way, so you will hear what they are saying better.

Try to sit in front, or close to where the teacher likes to stand. Experiment with places.
If the teacher assigns seats, ask for special seating due to your disability. Your teacher should appreciate your initiative in getting help!

, Here are things that may help you:

Hearing aid(s)/Cochlear Implant(s) - depending on your level of deafness or hard-of-hearing.
A sign language interpreter - the school can provide one.
A designated note-taker - the school will find a student volunteer, or pay a student. Some schools have specialized TAs.

Request to use the restroom.,
Get specific, if necessary.,
Cover up any stains.,
Relax.,
Remember that this is not new.",How to Tell Your Teacher You're Having Your Period1," Try to wait until there is a break in the class discussion or a transition between activities. Raise your hand or approach the teacher’s desk and ask to visit the restroom. Do this as soon as you suspect that your period is starting so you can avoid any staining. You may need to indicate that you can't wait, as some schools limit bathroom breaks.You might say something general, such as ""Excuse me, I know that we're going over important material right now, but I need to go to the restroom and it's urgent."";
, Provide additional details if your teacher refuses your first bathroom break request. Approach your teacher’s desk or wait until the end of class to keep this conversation private.


You could explain, “I’ve started my period and I need to visit the restroom to take care of it.”
For added protection, you can request, “Please keep this private.” They should do this anyway, but it might give you extra peace of mind to state it directly.

, Wrap a sweater or jacket around your waist, if you have one. If not, your teacher might let you borrow one. Know that just because you started your period does not mean that you will stain your clothes.

, Take a number of deep breaths as you walk to the restroom. Do a quick back stretch in the restroom. Smile. Remind yourself that women have periods and it is completely normal.

, The adults around you have all dealt with periods before, in one fashion or another. They are used to these situations and will not feel weird or embarrassed about talking about your period with you.

Avoid constricting clothes if you feel bloated as they will only make you more uncomfortable.

, Prepare to feel a bit embarrassed, especially around any male teachers. However, remember that they will not mention what happened and quite possibly have already forgotten. Remind yourself of every’s thing else that is going on in the classroom (doing work, taking roll) and that you are only one part of that process.

, Offer your thanks to anyone who helped you. Say, “Thank you!” or “You saved me!” or “I really appreciate what you did.” Keep it light and quick, but if you let them know how much they helped they may be more likely to help others in the future too."

Remind yourself that you are not the first person to start their period this way and you won't be the last.


It may help to mentally repeat, ""Calm down. Relax.""

, Your teacher is there to help you. Wait until there is a pause in class and approach their desk.


You might say, ""This is my first period. What should I do?"" They will then give you some options, such as visiting the nurse or the restroom.

, Ask your teacher for a pass to visit the nurse or go in between class periods. Let her know that this is your first period and she will provide you with supplies and advice.


If you are achy or hurting, let the nurse know that as well. Say, for example, ""My stomach has been cramping for the past hour or so."", Your parent can bring supplies up to you, such as pads, and can go over what you've already planned to do in this situation. They can also remind you that it will be okay and that what you are experiencing is perfectly normal.

, Find a private place, like an empty classroom, to talk with a trusted peer. Solicit her advice on what your next steps should be and how you will feel moving forward.


You might say, ""I've started my first period today and I'm not sure if I can participate in gym class. What do you do?""

"
Be clear in your own mind about why you think your teacher is horrible.,
Evaluate your own behavior.,
Talk to your teacher.,
Reward and encourage good teaching.,
Focus on your own success, not the teacher.",How to Survive Through School with a Horrible Teacher1," Once you have a bad impression of a teacher, it’s easy to start hating everything about them. Which aspects of your teacher’s behavior are really impeding your learning? What things are just mildly annoying? Identifying the core problems is the first step to developing a plan to deal with them.For example, you might have a teacher who makes corny jokes and also isn’t clear about what the homework assignment is. You might be able to ignore the jokes, but you could ask your teacher if he could post the homework assignment on the board before the end of class.
A very strict teacher might be annoying, especially if you learn better in a more relaxed environment. But if your teacher deliberately frightens or humiliates students, you may need to talk to a parent or other adult in the school about the situation.;
, What are you doing to contribute to the bad relationship between you and this teacher? You need to hold yourself accountable for your own behavior. Even if a teacher is boring, for example, you don’t have any excuse to nap during class.


If you realize that you are contributing to a bad situation, change your behavior – and apologize for it. For example, you might say: “I’m sorry that I didn’t pay attention in class yesterday. I know math is important, and I want to do better.” Don’t turn your apology into an opportunity to criticize: don’t say, for example, “I’m sorry I fell asleep – it’s just that you’re so boring.”

, Ask him, sincerely and respectfully, how you can do better in the class. Listen to his advice as well as any criticism they offer of you. Don’t respond defensively. Instead, try to reflect back what you hear in order to be sure you are understanding correctly.


Teachers often appreciate students who take initiative. Rather than asking, “How can I get a good grade?” try approaching a difficult teacher with a specific plan and ask for feedback. For instance, you could say: “I’m planning to study for this exam by re-reading the assigned chapters and making flashcards with the vocabulary. Does that sound like a good plan to you? Would you suggest anything else?”

, Just as your teachers try to encourage you, you can encourage your teacher to provide interesting, relevant lectures and assignments. This is a long-term approach, but it can pay dividends in your learning as well as in making the class more bearable.But always be sincere: faking enthusiasm will only make the relationship worse.


Ask questions that show that you’re doing the reading and engaging with the material. Burnt-out teachers may become more engaged and lively if they see that their students are genuinely interested.
Don’t only talk to your teacher to ask for extensions on deadlines or other favors.
Thank her for a particularly clear explanation or an assignment that really helped you to learn.

, It’s easy to get caught up in passing judgment and developing theories about people you don’t like. But difficult people usually have some hidden reasons for their unreasonable behavior.Remember that you don’t need to be friends with your teacher. Keep your focus on how to succeed as well as possible in the class.

"

Identify whether the issues are worth involving a parent.,
Discuss the issues with your parent.,
Ask your parent to contact your teacher.,
Follow up by phone if you don’t get a reply.,
Know when to ask your parent to contact the principal or other authority.",How to Survive Through School with a Horrible Teacher2," If your teacher’s behavior frightens you or makes it hard for you to learn, consider getting a parent involved. Examples of behavior that might warrant parental intervention:


Yelling frequently, belittling students, or deliberately humiliating students.
Being very disorganized. This might include losing assignments or failing to enter grades.
If the teacher can’t teach in a way that allows you to learn.
Handing out work without teaching material.

, Come prepared with specific examples. Rather than saying, “My teacher is scary,” for example, say: “Last Thursday, my teacher got so mad he hit all of our desks with a ruler and shouted at us for ten minutes. I was really scared.”

, It might be a good idea for your parent to e-mail or write to your teacher. That way, she has documentation of their interactions in case she needs to go to the principal or other authority later on. The e-mail can include a request for an in-person or telephone conversation, and it should include a telephone number.


Read the e-mail over before your parent sends it, if possible, to make sure that your parent has understood the issues.

, Your parent should note when he made the call.

, If the teacher doesn’t respond, the issues are not resolved, or the situation worsens, it’s time to talk to someone above the teacher.

"
"
Recognize inappropriate or abusive behavior.,
Pay attention to your own reactions.,
Take notes and document inappropriate behavior.,
Take it up with your parents and the higher authorities.,
Request to be switched out of the class.",How to Survive Through School with a Horrible Teacher3," In many places, teachers are never allowed to reprimand their students physically. Teachers should never approach their students romantically or sexually, or make sexually charged comments or jokes.Humiliating or bullying students is not ok.


For example, teachers should not make comments such as, “If you were older, I would date you,” or other remarks that seem to suggest or invite a romantic relationship. Sometimes these comments can seem flattering. However, they are an abuse of the teacher-student relationship.
Teachers should not single students out for humiliation or invite other students to mock them. Reprimanding students in this fashion is inappropriate, bullying behavior.
While it’s normal for a teacher to impose reasonable consequences or speak sternly to a student, she should not scream, subject a student to a lengthy tirade, or threaten a student with disproportionate punishments., It’s normal to dread a class taught by a bad teacher, but fear or sadness about entering a classroom may be a signal that something more serious is going on.Notice if your feelings about the class are impacting the rest of your life or preventing you from enjoying your normal activities. It’s one thing not to love math class; it’s another to have your whole week overshadowed by it.

, Note down the date and, if possible, exact words or actions, or record it with your phone. This kind of information will be more helpful than general statements such as, “She always picks on one kid,” or “He often talks about girls and dating in a weird way.” Notice what other students or teachers witnessed the incident., Inappropriate or abusive behavior needs to be reported. Start by discussing it with your parents. You may ask them to meet with the principal, head-teacher, department head, or other appropriate authority. Be prepared to submit your concerns in writing. If these conversations don’t have an effect, talk to those higher up: the superintendent, the school board, or the local education authority, for example. Physical or sexual abuse should be reported to the police if you feel safe doing so. You can also seek out a therapist or counselor and disclose what’s happening. If you don’t feel able to speak to anyone, call a hotline that specializes in child abuse., While the school authorities deal with this teacher, you should not have to be her class. Ask to be switched into another class, if possible, or allowed to drop the course and re-take it with another instructor.

"
"
Don’t avoid doing work in a class just because you don’t like the teacher.,
Set your own goals.,
Rely on other teachers where possible.,
Form a study group with other students in your class.Studying with friends can offer the moral support you need to survive the horrible teacher.,
Find out if you have a learning disability.",How to Survive Through School with a Horrible Teacher4," Try to do all the assigned work and keep up with the material anyway. Sometimes, you may find that you like a very demanding teacher better once you start to get a grasp on the subject.

, If a teacher is not really teaching a class, you might have to set your own learning goals and work to achieve them. Use external sources of information to gauge what you should be learning in this class. Setting realistic personal goals is a crucial part of self-directed learning.


For example, if you are in a class that is supposed to be preparing you for a set exam, find published older versions of that exam in your library. Work your way through one of them and identify what you still need to learn.
Make use of your textbook. Most textbooks have sample questions and answers at the ends of chapters. Set a goal of being able to answer 80% of the relevant questions correctly.

, Take full advantage of other resources, such as designated tutoring times led by other teachers, to learn the subject taught by the horrible teacher. Just because you can’t learn a topic from this teacher doesn’t mean you should learn it at all!


For example, if your foreign language teacher is horrible, you might ask another teacher in the language department for advice on learning and practicing that language. Don’t criticize your teacher, but just ask for resources to help you learn outside the classroom.

, In addition, you may understand a particular concept better if you hear someone else explain it.


Take turns teaching one another the key concepts each week. Use a white board or chart paper to sketch out and demonstrate ideas.
Quiz one another using flashcards to help retain information.

, If your difficulties aren’t limited to just one teacher, you might benefit from evaluation for a learning disability. Do you find it difficult in general to read, or to remember, or to follow directions or stay organized?Common learning disabilities include dyslexia, which affects your ability to read and process language, and dysgraphia, which affects your ability to write. Getting appropriate accommodations and support will help you succeed in all of your classes.Talk to a trusted teacher or guidance counselor about your concerns. Your school may also have a dedicated Accessibility or Accommodations office which will be able to help you access evaluation and support.

If you have notebooks for the class (the study for a test type), write your note with the paper inside the notebook.",How to Pass Notes in Class1," Close it into a square as small as it will go, and keep your handwriting as small as possible. Remember, you are trying to be inconspicuous.

, A simpler way to pass the note is to place your hand on the receiver's desk as if steadying yourself and let the note slide out. Or if your neighbor has a purse or bag that is slightly open, you can drop the note in there.

, If your eyes are focused on them, it will be much easier to tell when to hide.

, If you know you'll have a class together with the receiver try to sit in front of, or behind them, instead of next to each other or rows apart. It's less obvious to pass notes over your shoulder than across rows.

, It will look like you're writing down and sharing notes about what the teacher was going on about - not what a cute guy just said to you.

Just remember to watch the teacher!;
, Take tiny post-it notes and stick them inside the textbook. Write different notes to direct the receiver like, turn to page 3, turn to page 66, until they find the note. It will look like you or the receiver is studying instead of reading the note.

For example: ""Is the project due on Thursday or Friday?"" or ""Did you understand the last chapter?""

Prepare.,
Choose the right moment.,
No matter how you may feel, don't have an attitude.,
Never turn the process into an argument.,
If you have a problem with the way a professor teaches do not tell them it's bad and they need to change it.,
If you are in fact wrong and they have defeated all of your evidence, accept defeat.,
If the teacher does admit you are right, do not rub it in.",How to Tell a Teacher She Is Teaching Incorrectly," If you're going to challenge a teacher's ruling on a particular subject or question, you better make well sure you are correct and have the evidence to back it up. Do your research, and this does not mean Wikipedia. As helpful and accurate as it may be these days it just isn't seen as credible by the majority of academia and sometimes is not. However it is often a great place to start that can lead you more sound evidence through the headings at the bottom of the page.


Search legitimate, peer-reviewed databases such as JSTOR for data supporting your point you can present to your prof. Your teacher will be impressed that you took the effort and will be more considerate.;
, People usually have a pride on their work. When you expose someone in public you can hurt not only their pride, but also their image as an authority and even the institution that backs them. Take care to choose the proper time and place to talk; wait after the class is over or on his/her office. Making it into a private matter will give you a better opportunity to be heard without rising a defensive attitude.

, You need to be respectful and mature without sarcasm, facial expression or any other body language that suggests opposition or defiance if you want to be taken seriously. In their mind they didn't endure 4 years of school to get their Baccalaureate degree with anywhere from 2-7 years of school on top of that for their masters or doctorate to be listening to you whine like a 5 year old about what you think is right, and frankly they are correct. This sends your credibility straight out the window. They will stop listening immediately and make up their mind that they were right. In order to be taken seriously you need to present yourself in a manner that is as non-oppositional as possible, as if you are working with or for them rather than against them. Remember that they have much more power than you and have the ultimate say.

, If you feel it start to escalate remember to keep your cool. Present your point to them as if you are trying to understand why they determined you were wrong, not necessarily that you think you were right. When you present evidence, never be absolute about it. For example, I speak like this ""Ma'am, it seems that these reference supports the fact that Al Gore does indeed live on the moon, do you see my point? Rather than: ""Look at this data! There is no way you can tell me Al GORE doesn't live on the moon based on this!"". See how the first one was much less absolute and more polite? Teachers like this because they don't feel like they're being threatened. They are further more likely to explain to you why they thought you were incorrect.

, Again, they will feel like they're being judged/threatened/being demeaned, and none of them like that. Instead, you mention that you are having difficulty learning in the style they use and politely suggest/ask them if they can modify it a bit to help you. Contrary to popular belief, most teachers want you to succeed and do well. They certainly are grossly underpaid for what they do, and are thus not teaching for the money (unless they are doing research or are tenured), so most of the gratification of teaching comes from seeing students learn things and be able to do things because they taught them! If you put it in the context of ""I'm struggling and want to learn better"" rather than ""I need a good grade"" then they will be much more likely to help you.

, Nothing is worse than having a long, drawn out, pointless argument with a teacher that you know you've already lost but you don't want to admit you're wrong. Realistically, they will not see you as any less of a person if you politely say ""OK, I understand now, thank you for clarifying this"", and if you do have an argument during this process, they will remember it for a long time and continue to grade and judge you in all interaction based on it whether it's ethical or not. Again, be civil. This stuff should give you a good shot at at least understanding why you were wrong.

, Being someone who is supposed to be right and was proved wrong by their student, who should know less, is extremely embarrassing. You need to do everything you can to try to not have them embarrassed so that they will not associate you with negative feelings which could affect future interaction. This means you need to thoroughly thank them for listening to your case and that you appreciate the consideration. Show them you still have respect for them as your teacher for what they went through to get there and what they know (for which you honestly should). Remember, they didn't have to admit they were wrong.

It will help make you seem friendlier and more interested in what the teacher is saying. People respond well to smiles and other pleasant expressions. This is a simple tool, but it can be crucial to maintaining a good relationship.Just be careful not to spend too much time smiling at the teacher. You also should be looking at the board or taking notes. Otherwise, it looks like you aren’t paying attention.;
, Most teachers can tell from the front of the room who is interested and paying attention. Teachers put a lot of effort into creating a class, and they like the reward of seeing people respond to it.The best way to look interested is to keep your eyes forward, and take notes or write down things your teacher says. If you are looking somewhere else, or just staring without writing things down, your teacher won’t believe you are interested.
As an added bonus, you will probably paying attention to the class. This not only means you will do better, but you will also be more likely to find out things your teacher likes.

, Teachers like it when students are involved and participate in class. If your teacher asks the class a question, be the first one to raise your hand. In most cases, it won’t matter if you’re wrong, as your teachers will appreciate the effort.Wait for your teacher to finish asking the question before raising your hand. That will prove you are listening to the question, and will be ready to give a good effort.
Just be sure you are trying to give a serious answer, and not making a joke. Teachers don’t like that at all.

, Like many other people, teachers have an unconscious bias towards people that look and act like them. If your teacher can believe you are like her in many ways, she will think better of you, and might be more lenient in grades. This is less true for a subject like math, where this is a right answer, but if you need to show your work the teacher might be more willing to give partial credit.This doesn’t have to be related to the stuff you are learning about in class. If your teacher says she likes something, like a type of music or food, then tell her that you like it too. Adding something quick like “I love that song” or “Chinese food is my favorite” during class in response to her mentioning something is good enough. Just be careful not to tell your teacher that you like what she likes every time she mentions something. It will make your sucking up obvious, which won’t help.
You can also mention it to your teacher after class, and maybe ask for more information. For example, if your teacher likes a certain type of food, ask what her favorite restaurant is, and tell her that you’d like to try it with your parents.
Another way to mimic the teacher is to copy the way she dresses. Look at the particular way your teacher dresses, or if she likes to wear a certain color. If there is something you can copy, wear it when you can. You won’t have to say anything, as the teacher will probably notice the similarity subconsciously.

, If the teacher needs something done, be the one to do it. Your teacher will notice and appreciate that you want to make her life easier. #*Your help doesn’t need to be big. It could be helping to set up for a project, or running a book to the library.


Of course, if your teacher asks you to do something directly, do it with a smile and without complaining.
Watch your teacher as well, and wait for moments when she might need help. If it seems like she is having trouble doing things in the class, or could use an extra pair of hands, ask if you can help. Even if she doesn’t need it, she will appreciate that you were willing to offer., If your teacher is having a debate in class, either as part of the lesson or because another student disagrees with him, figure out what he believes and repeat that argument.If the teacher is arguing with another student, and not as part of the lesson, don’t jump in during class. Instead, wait until afterward and tell the teacher you agreed with him. Or, if the teacher was dealing with a disruptive student, thank him for stopping it. Something simple like “Thank you for making Billy be quiet, I was having trouble concentrating” will be enough. Teachers like to feel appreciated, and believe they are doing the right thing.

, This seems pretty easy, and it is. Still, a little politeness can go a long way, and your teacher will probably enjoy the interaction. This can work either in the classroom, or if you see your teacher somewhere else in the school, or even out in public.Make sure you are aware of time and place when you meet. If your teacher looks very busy, or in a hurry to get somewhere, don’t stop for a long conversation. A quick hello is all you will need. Anything more will just be annoying, and won’t help you.

, If you’re interested in the material, go ahead and talk to your teacher about it, or related topics that interest you. Your teacher wants to create enthusiasm for the subject, so anything you can do to show you are interested will make his day.When you go talk to your teacher, make sure you have something in mind to discuss. Teachers are busy people, and won’t want to sit around if you have nothing to talk about. A specific question like “I still don’t understand this topic” can help keep you focused and give the teacher something to respond to. A non-specific or blanket statement like “I’m confused” doesn’t help either of you.
You can also mention something interesting that is related to the class, maybe something else you’ve seen or read that seems familiar. For example, if your teacher was explaining a scientific principle, mention that you saw something similar in a movie, or the news, and ask if it is the same thing.

, It shouldn’t be big or special, just a way to suggest you appreciate their effort and like the way they are teaching.Just be careful not to do this too often, or it will look really obvious that you are trying to suck up.


The gift should be something small. Consider getting a gift card or even something you make yourself. A small handmade card or crafty item is more personal, and will help the teacher remember you.Something that reminds you of the lesson you just had can be good, as it tells the teacher you were paying attention.
Avoid stuff like mugs or candles. Teachers will get lots of stuff like that, meaning your gift won’t stand out and be memorable.
Remember to get gifts for holidays, especially Christmas. Other students will probably be getting your teacher a gift then too, so it won’t look too obvious that you are sucking up. Plus, you’ll definitely look better than those kids that didn’t get the teacher anything.

, This is a way to tell the teacher he is doing a good job, so if you are enjoying it, let him know.You want to make sure you have been paying attention to the class. If you haven't been, and the teacher has noticed, he won't take your compliment seriously.


This doesn’t have to be a long conversation. As you leave, start by telling the teacher “I really liked it when we…” and mention something that you found interesting. Close by saying something like “That was fun” or “I really get that idea now,” which tells the teacher he did a good job.

, This may seem very obvious, but you need to attend class regularly in order to convince the teacher you care about it. Not showing up will hurt your grade, and you won’t give your teacher any reason to be nicer to you.If you miss class for some reason, like being sick or having to be out of town, let your teacher know as soon as you can. Ask what you will miss (or have missed), and ask about the best ways to get back on track with your assignments.

, Bring all relevant materials, including pencils, pens, papers, textbooks, and homework assignments to class. Constantly having to ask the teacher or your neighbor for materials is an annoyance and shows a lack of effort in class. Your teacher will be impressed that you are on top of everything.


The best way to do this is to show up a little early for class. That way, you will have time to get all of your stuff together, and be ready to go when the teacher starts class. If you aren’t ready, you will probably miss something because you were getting your materials out while the lesson began., Make sure to know and complete instructions given both in class and in assignments. After you find out, make sure you follow the guidelines on all tests and homework. Teachers make guidelines for a reason, and it can be very annoying when students don’t follow them.


Some teachers will be very specific about their instructions, so make sure you follow all of them. This could mean particular ways to title your assignments, places to put your answer, or specific information to include in your answers. If you aren’t sure about those instructions, ask the teacher.
While teachers say they want students to be creative, they really want students who can follow directions and do work they way they asked. Creative people are unpredictable, and your teacher will like that she knows what you will do with a project or assignment., Your teacher wants to know that you are interested and engaged with the subjects. Asking and answering questions is a great way to do that, plus it will help you better understand the material.One good way to do this is to ask questions about the material, but in a way that suggests you are keeping up with the class. Ask how what you are talking about how relates to material from a previous class, or how it compares to the reading you did. Your teacher will be impressed that you are trying to think more deeply about the stuff you are learning.
Another good way is to participate is to answer questions when your teacher asks them. Getting classes to respond to questions can be hard, so teachers always like it when someone makes an effort to give their opinion.

, Teachers notice when you treat others poorly. If you are nice to your classmates, even the ones who aren’t your friends, your teacher will think better of you.You can help your classmates make making sure they have the right materials and information for the class. Don’t be afraid to share your supplies, or help someone else who needs it. You will look nicer for helping, and your teacher will see how prepared you are.
Don’t laugh or make fun of students who answer questions incorrectly. That makes you look mean, which the teacher will definitely notice.

Ask to go to the bathroom.,
Allude to the subject.,
Relax.,
Talk to a female teacher or an older female student.,
Talk to the principal.,
Ask to see the nurse.,
Carry supplies in your locker or backpack.",How to Tell a Guy Teacher You Are Having Your Period," If you do not want to explicitly state you're on your period, it may be best to initially try to avoid doing so. Simply ask for the bathroom pass, following all the rules that particular teacher has set regarding restroom use. You do not need to tell him what you need the pass for.;
, Some teachers are stricter when it comes to use of a hall or bathroom pass. Teachers will often ask if it's necessary to use the pass, whether it's an ""emergency,"" or simply ask you to wait until the break between classes or lunch. If this is the case, you can tactfully allude to the situation without going into specifics.


A vague statement, like ""It's kind of personal..."" or ""It's a girl thing..."" will probably get the message across.If your teacher is very no nonsense and generally does not let people leave during class, try talking to him in private ahead of time. You do not need to explicitly state you're menstruating, but say you're having a ""female problem"" and might need to use the hall pass., Many women, especially those new to menstruation, have a lot of anxiety about talking to their male teachers. It can be an awkward, embarrassing subject. However, relax. Remember your male teacher has had extensive training for educating this age group and has probably been told to prepare for such situations. In fact, he's probably had to deal with this in his past experience teaching as well. Even if the idea seems mortifying on your end, your male teacher will likely not think much of it at all., If you're unsure how to approach a male teacher, talk to a female friend or teacher. If you feel particularly comfortable with a female teacher, such as the teacher who you had for sex ed, ask her for advice on explaining menstruation to male faculty. An older female friend, someone who has been menstruating longer than you, would also be a good resource. She might have had to undergo the same awkward experience and might have some tips for you., If a male teacher continually refuses, even if you explicitly explain what's going on, make an appointment to discuss this with the principal. This may be awkward, but for health reasons no student should be forced to sit through class with a pad or tampon that needs to be changed.


You might want to ask your parents to come with you, as the meeting might be stressful. Talking to a higher authority figure, especially while still in school, can be difficult grounds to navigate and having older adults present would help.Explain to the principal that your male teacher makes it difficult for you to deal with your period in class. If your teacher has ever said anything that's made you uncomfortable, such as joking comments about your cycle, these warrant mentioning. Male teachers have an obligation to create an environment where female students do not feel guilty or ashamed about menstruation. If your male teacher is not doing his part, the principle has a right to know.

, In the event of an emergency, such an unexpected period or a leak, ask to see the school nurse. He or she can help you contact your parents and find somewhere for you to wait while they bring you supplies.


You do not need to explain to a male teacher what's going on in this case. Simply say, ""I need to see a nurse. I'm not feeling well.""If your teacher is wary to let you see the nurse, and you're uncomfortable explaining you had a period related accident, claim you feel you might throw up or something else that would warrant attention. If you are comfortable alluding to the subject, again say something, ""It's a female thing,"" but also add ""It's kind of an emergency"" so he understands the importance of you exiting the classroom., Sometimes, periods come unexpectedly. If you're just being to menstruate, your cycle might not be regular for a year or two. Make sure you're prepared to deal with unexpected mishaps.


Keep a stash of tampons or pads in your locker. If you're close to a particular teacher or guidance counselor, ask if you can leave supplies with him or her. If you're out, you can also try asking a female friend.If you're not sure when your period is going to come, you can wear a light panty liner around the time you expect it. You should not use a tampon until your period has actually started.Your period usually will start with small drips and not big leaks, so if you get your period during class or on the bus it's probably okay to wait until you reach a bathroom. It's unlikely leaking will start right away."

A thank you note

Consider writing a preliminary draft on your composing and transferring the text by hand for your note. This may help you think in more detail about what you’d like to write.
Print out your note from the computer and sign it by hand if you prefer.

Speak to the teacher at the end of the lesson.,
If the teacher apologizes, accept the apology and take no further action.

,
Consider next steps.",How to Stand Up to a Teacher That Has Humiliated You," Don't stare or glare at them; try to have a blank expression on your face.;
, Do they have a genuine reason to be angry at you? Or are they just taking their Monday morning blues out on you?

, Lashing out in anger can end up backfiring further on you. Control your own reaction. It's best to let them have their 'moment' without trying to fight back.


Crying in front of others does not make you weak. Humans show emotion and there's nothing wrong about that.

, Now this is something you should have a long hard think about, if they had a genuine reason to be angry with you then it's best to leave this. But, if you feel you were genuinely degraded for no reason then speak to them If they have calmed down that is. Let them know how you feel. Teachers are human too. Tell them you felt humiliated and degraded and you are not happy that they ripped your head off in front of your peers.

,, If the teacher does not, talk to your peers first. Ask them if they agree that you were unfairly treated. If your teacher is humiliating you in front of the class and it's genuinely bad, speak up to another teacher or an administrator or official. See your head of year or even your favorite teacher for advice; they may recommend you see the headmaster/ principal.

Learn your school’s policies.,
Know your teachers’ preferences.,
Always put your phone away during tests.",How to Prevent Your Teacher from Taking Your Phone Away1," A school administrator has the right to confiscate your phone if doing so corresponds with your school’s student code of conduct. This code outlines the rights and responsibilities of students and teachers, as well appropriate disciplinary measures to be taken in response to infractions. Rules vary by school, and it is the right of every student to read and understand them fully; if the regulations are not available on your school’s website, ask an administrator for a copy., While your school might have specific regulations concerning cell phones, your teachers may be strict or lenient about how they enforce them. Be sure to note anything a teacher says about cell phone use in class at the beginning of the semester. If they don’t specify their policy (and the corresponding penalties), ask them directly. For example, you might ask: “Do you have any specific rules regarding cell phones in your classroom?""If you do not feel comfortable approaching them about the subject directly, try asking former students a year or two ahead of you what the teacher’s rules about cell phones were, and what the consequences of defying them were.

, If you use your cell phone during an exam, your teacher will likely confiscate it for several reasons. Aside from distracting other students, your smart phone is a tool that can easily be used to cheat on a test; students can access saved notes, text answers to other students, or look up answers online. With cheating via cell phones becoming more prevalent, your safest bet is to keep yours far out of reach during test periods.To make sure that your teacher does not suspect you of cell phone use during a test, bury your phone at the bottom of your bag or leave it in your locker.

"
"
Put your phone on silent.,
Let people know that you're in class.,
Turn your phone off.,
Keep your phone in your locker.",How to Prevent Your Teacher from Taking Your Phone Away2," To avoid getting your cell phone taken away, put it on silent mode. If you are expecting an important text message or call, check your phone at certain intervals during the class. Avoid looking at your phone for more than a few seconds each time, and try to be as discreet as possible; place your phone out of sight, but easy to reach (e.g. in an otherwise empty sweater pocket.)If you are expecting a call, program in an auto-reply message beforehand to send to the caller – for example, write, “I am in class and can’t take your all. I will call you back when class is dismissed.”

, Let friends and family know when you will be in class. Offer an alternate time for them to contact you (e.g. “I will be in class from 8:30am until 2:30pm, but you can reach me during my lunch hour from 11:30am - 12:30pm.”) Try to avoid texting people right before class begins, as they will likely text back you during the first few minutes of class.


To be safe, let friends and family know that it is better to avoid texting you during the daytime altogether.

, If you don't mind getting texts a bit late, turn your phone off entirely while you are in class. This guarantees that you will not receive any disruptive calls or texts, and it removes the temptation to use your phone for texts, email, or social media during dull moments. If for some reason your teacher sees the phone and tries to confiscate it, show them that it is in fact turned off to prove that you were not using it during class.You can also opt to put your cell phone on airplane mode so you will not receive any calls or texts, or have access to the internet.

, Keeping your phone in your locker during the school day will ensure that you don’t have it taken away in class. If you opt to keep you phone locked away, advise your family beforehand to prevent worry if they try to contact you. Be sure that you have a strong lock on your locker, and that no one else knows the combination to it."
"
Heed your teacher’s first warnings.,
Look attentive and interested.,
Get special permission.",How to Prevent Your Teacher from Taking Your Phone Away3," Teachers often resort to confrontational measures like confiscating cell phones because other actions fail to work (e.g. a reprimand in front of the class). If your teacher sees you using your phone and warns you to put it away, apologize, tell them it won’t happen again, and stop using it immediately. Using the phone again will only seem disrespectful and push your teacher to take stronger action.If you are caught in this situation, say, “I apologize, it won’t happen again. I will put my phone away immediately.”

, Picture your classroom from your teacher’s perspective. Ask yourself where they might be looking when they are sitting or standing in front of the classroom, and what movement or actions might catch their eye. Always look at your teacher while they are speaking, appear focused and interested, and:Avoid looking down at your phone for more than a few seconds at a time
Participate in group discussions as much as possible to convey that you are engaged in the day’s lesson
If you are going to text in class, pre-program generic responses on your phone to avoid lengthy typing (such as, “I’m fine, how are you?”)

, If you have a legitimate reason for needing access to your phone in class (e.g. family crisis, health issues) get a written note from a parent, doctor, or other influential individual. If this is not possible, simply visit or contact your teacher outside of classroom hours to request permission to use your cell phone in class. Approach your teacher in a straightforward way to demonstrate respect for them and their classroom rules.Say something like, “There are special circumstances that make it important for me to have access to my cell phone at all times. I understand your policy regarding cell phones, but I was hoping that you could make an exception given my current situation.”

Date it right.,

She will probably only give you a small job to do first, as she doesn't have your full trust yet, but keep building up, and you will soon be the Job Champion!

,
Ignore the original teacher's pet (OTP) if she tries to mock you or stop you doing her jobs.

",How to Replace the Organised Teacher's Pet in Your Class," You don't want to try to replace the girl if there are only a few days left of that year! Do it a few weeks after the teacher starts to favour her, which is usually quite early in the year.;
, Watch her carefully for a week. No, this isn't a written invitation to follow her around and ask repeatedly: 'What are you doing now?'! Just sit quietly from your seat and watch her do her 'jobs'. Take note (in your mind if you have a good memory, or on a notepad) what she does, how she addresses the teacher, how she wears her uniform (is her skirt over her knees? Does she pull her sleeves up?) and what speed she does everything.

, After break, get your stuff really quickly so you are the first in the classroom. Put your stuff down on the table and ask your teacher if there are any jobs they would like you to do. Say something like: 'Miss ____, are there any jobs you would like me to do?'. Don't give an excuse to do a job, like saying 'I've finished my book, should I do a job for you?' will only indicate that helping the teacher is your second choice.

Sit strategically.,
Look toward the front of the classroom.,
Have an appropriate balance of eye contact.,
Look confident.",How to Not Get Called on in Class1," You want to try to sit in the teacher’s blind spot so they hopefully don’t notice you. Where you sit depends on the style of your classroom and your teacher. Try to sit in the edge of the classroom, out of the teacher’s main focus of vision. You can sit in the back to hopefully hide or the very front so the teacher possibly completely looks past you and forgets you are there.You can try to sit next to someone who answers a lot of questions to hopefully blend in next to them.;
, While the teacher is teaching, look toward them. Don’t look out the window, fidget, doodle, or text. At least look like you are paying attention to what they are saying. The teacher might find it disrespectful and think you are not paying attention if you seem distracted., When your teacher is scanning the room trying to decide who to call on, do not make direct eye contact with the teacher. However, don’t clearly avoid eye contact and definitely don’t look down. Look away for a second then look back at the teacher then look away again. Try to find a good balance between completely avoiding looking at your teacher and looking at them too much., Even if you aren’t confident and have no idea what the answer to the question is, pretend you do. Sit up straight and don’t look worried or nervous. Don’t look eager to answer the question, but don’t look like you clearly were not paying attention either. The teacher will likely call on someone who either seems overly confident or nervous."

Look through your notes.,
Pretend to write down notes.,
Rifle through your bag.,
Make a concentrated face.,
Raise your hand when you do know the answer.",How to Not Get Called on in Class2," When the teacher is scanning the room, looking for someone to call on, search through your notes. Make it look like you are trying to find the answer and that you remember writing it down. If the teacher sees you searching through your notes, they might not call on you because they know you are trying to find the right answer., You should write real notes too, but if you are trying to trick your teacher not to call on you, pretend to write more notes. If the teacher is scanning the room, start writing down notes as if you are writing down a few more points from what the teacher said. The teacher will think you are really concentrating and trying to understand all the points., When the teacher is deciding who to call on start rifling through your backpack, binder, or pencil case like you are looking for something important. Your teacher will hopefully see that you are focused on needing something urgently and not want to interrupt you., Look like you are really focused and trying to think of the answer when the teacher is calling on students. If you look like you are concentrating the teacher will assume you were paying attention, but don’t know the answer, so they won’t call on you.


You can also try making a really confused face like you don’t understand the question., When you do know the answer or the question is easy, raise your hand! That way when the question is hard the teacher won’t call on you because you already talked and participated."
"
Overcome speaking anxiety.,
Pay attention in class.,
Do your homework so you are prepared.",How to Not Get Called on in Class3," If the reason you want to avoid getting called on in class is because you are nervous to talk in front of other people, you might have a speaking anxiety. You can overcome this by being prepared for class and feeling confident and positive.


Start your answers strong and don’t mumble.
Practice speaking in front of smaller groups and then work your way up to talking in class., If you pay attention and concentrate, you will feel a lot more comfortable answering questions in class. When the teacher talks, actively listen and try to process what is being said. Take notes while the teacher talks and sit in the front of the class.Don’t be on your phone during class. It will distract you and stop you from paying attention.

, If you come to class unprepared, you won’t know the answer to any questions. Do any homework assignments before class so you are prepared for any questions that the teacher might ask. If you feel confident, you won’t have to worry about avoiding the teacher and you will have a better experience in class.

Remove yourself from the situation.,
Try a mental distraction.,
Give yourself a pep talk.,
Resist the urge to yell back.,
Pinch the bridge of your nose.,
Have a talk with your teacher.,
Admit when you are wrong.,
Find a solution to the problem.,
Pay attention to what causes your teacher to yell.,
Work to meet your teacher's expectations.,
Recognize bullying behavior.,

Go up the chain of command.,
File a report.",How to Not Cry when a Teacher Shouts at You," It may not always be possible in school, but one of the best ways to prevent yourself from crying is to step away from the stressful situation, even for just a minute. If possible, excuse yourself to the bathroom or even to the other side of the room. You could also ask to go talk to your counselor.Never leave the classroom without permission. This will only make your teacher more angry with you.;
, If you can't physically remove yourself from the situation, you can still remove yourself mentally from the stress. Focus your mind on something else to help you keep your cool while you're being yelled at.Try focusing on your breathing. Inhaling and exhaling slowly and deeply can help keep you calm, and actively thinking about your breathing can help temporarily take your mind off of the situation with your teacher.
Alternatively, you can try counting in your head or counting objects in the room, such as the floor or ceiling tiles.

, If you feel like you're about to cry, try silently repeating some words of encouragement to yourself. This can help ignite your inner strength and keep you positive, so you'll feel much better about the situation and may not feel like crying anymore.You can use whatever words or phrase you want. Some examples are ""I'll get through this"" or ""I'm strong and can deal with this situation.""
You can also give yourself a little hug to comfort yourself.

, It is almost always a bad idea to yell back at your teacher, even if you have done nothing to deserve being yelled at. This will only make the situation more stressful, which will make it harder for you to stop yourself from crying.Instead of yelling back, your goal should be to deescalate the situation as much as possible so that the stress that causes you to want to cry goes away. Being cooperative and polite in response to your teacher's yelling is usually a great way to do this.

, If mental exercises aren't enough to keep you from crying, you may be able to stop oncoming tears by pinching the bridge of your nose. This will restrict the tear ducts, which may be enough to prevent yourself from crying., If your teacher yells at you a lot, the two of you may have some issues that you need to sort out. Ask your teacher if you can talk before or after class. This will give you the opportunity to discuss the reason for the shouting, and hopefully solve the underlying problem.If you feel your teacher is making unfair assumptions about you, say so, but do it in a diplomatic way instead of arguing. For example, you might say, ""I get the feeling that you think I don't care about your class, but I really do.""
If you don't know why your teacher is yelling at you, ask him or her to explain what expectations you are failing to meet.

, In some cases, your teacher may be yelling at you because you are failing to take responsibility for your own actions. You can solve this problem by admitting when you make mistakes and not making excuses.Never lie to your teacher.
If you do something wrong, simply apologize instead of making an excuse.
To make an apology sound more sincere, make sure you let your teacher know that you understand what you did wrong and that you will do your best not to do it again. For example, you might say, ""I know that I was distracting the rest of the class by telling jokes, and I am sorry for that. I will try not to interrupt the class again.""

, If you find that you are getting yelled at a lot for acting in a specific way, try to think of something you could do to help remove the temptation to act that way. Your teacher will likely appreciate the initiative you take in correcting your own behavior.For example, if you cannot stop talking to your friends in class, ask your teacher to move your seat so that you will not be tempted anymore.

, Everyone has different triggers that cause them stress. Try to notice the specific things that tend to cause your teacher to yell and shout, and then avoid doing those things.For example, some teachers may yell a lot when students talk out of turn, while other teachers may get more upset when students use their cell phones during class.
In some cases, stressful situations may cause your teacher to be more irritable. For example, if you notice that your teacher tends to yell a lot more right before a big test, try to be on your best behavior when you know a test is coming up.

, The best thing you can do to prevent your teacher from shouting at your in the future is to work hard to meet the classroom expectations. Every teacher is different, but you can get on almost any teacher's good side by behaving well and putting your best effort into your work.Be polite and respectful of everyone in class.
Do your best academically, and do extra credit work if you're struggling.
Be on time and come to class prepared.
Offer to help out by collecting papers or stacking chairs.

, Teachers can be bullies just like other students. Not all yelling and shouting should be considered bullying, however, so consider the situation carefully in order to determine whether the shouting goes beyond reasonable disciplinary measures. If it does, there is a chance your teacher may be bullying you.Think about the behavior that you displayed leading up to the shouting. If you were doing something dangerous or irresponsible, the shouting may be warranted. If you were just asking the teacher a reasonable question, the shouting may be bullying.
If a teacher insults or taunts you, this may be bullying.
Any kind of physical abuse is bullying and is completely unacceptable.

, If you're dealing with a teacher who yells at you for no reason, singles you out, or insults you, you need to tell your parents what is going on. They may be able to talk to the teacher and help resolve the problem for you. If that doesn't work, your parents can be your advocates and help you figure out other ways to handle the situation.Be as specific as possible when detailing your teacher's actions. For example, instead of saying, ""My teacher is mean to me,"" say something like, ""My teacher called me stupid because I didn't understand the lesson."" Giving clear examples will help your parents take you more seriously.

, If you and your parents are not able to resolve the bullying problems directly with your teacher, you may want to consider speaking with the teacher's boss. Try to start with the person to whom the teacher directly reports. In some cases, this might be the principal, but in other cases, it might be a senior teacher or the vice principal.You may choose to have your parents do this for you, or you may decide that you want to be involved in the conversation.
Instead of insulting the teacher, provide specific examples of the problems you are having with the teacher and explain how the teacher makes you feel.

, If the principal fails to help the situation and the bullying is severe enough that it is interrupting your ability to learn, you and your parents should take your complaints to a higher level. You can submit a formal complaint to the school board or the superintendent.

It helps to provide some kind of proof with a formal complaint. If you have anything in writing that can demonstrate your teacher's bullying behaviors, make sure you keep it.
If your concerns are still not addressed, you may want to ask your parents about the possibility of switching schools.

Attend your classes on time.,
Bring all the required materials to class.,
Complete your homework and reading before class.,
Study for tests.,
Get a good night’s rest.,
Learn something extra.",How to Make Your Teacher Happy1," While being on time is important every day, being seated before class starts on the first day is exactly the first impression you want to make to your teacher! It shows that you’re responsible, respectful and punctual. Make sure you do what’s necessary to get to class on time that first day and every one thereafter.If you need to set your alarm a ½ hour earlier in the morning to make sure you have plenty of time to get ready, do that. If it’s adding more books to your backpack so you don’t get sidetracked talking to your friends at the lockers, do that. Teachers do not look kindly upon interruptions during class.


Use the restroom between classes, so you don’t need to excuse yourself once class has started.
You want to be in your seat with everything out of your bag and ready in front of you before class starts. Allow the time you need for this.;
, Whether it’s an art class requiring certain brushes and paints or a math class requiring a protractor, make sure that when you enter the classroom door you have everything you need. It shows your teacher that you’re taking the class seriously. Not having everything you need leaves a less-than-stellar impression, and it takes up class time in borrowing or sharing with someone else.


Never forget to bring the obvious things like pens, pencils and the right books.
Use a 3-ring binder with dividers for different subjects to help keep things organized.
If you can’t afford something you need for the class, ask to talk with your teacher about it after class or at another time. Your teacher will do his or her best to help.

, Turning in assignments when they’re due is essential.Turning in assignments that demonstrate you took your time by being neat and legible, that you read the assigned material and that you exercised your brain in completing your work? That’s the difference between an “A” and a “B-"" or “C"" and will make your teacher pleased, seeing that you are responsible, have a good work ethic and care about your performance.It also allows you to follow along in class better and to ask questions you may have had while reading ahead.
If you have poor handwriting, type assignments and papers as much as possible. The easier you make your assignments and papers to read, the better! Remember – your teacher has a whole stack, just for your class. Making it easy to get through is to your advantage.

, Going along with being responsible in your homework and reading, you also need to be well prepared for tests. Studying for tests regularly almost always results in higher grades. And good grades are good for you all around. Students have different test study habits and methods. Figure out the best ones for you and put them to good use.


If you’re not in a study group, consider asking others you know in class if they’d like to form one. A good study group should have about 3-5 members. If it’s too large, it can get loud and confusing.
Cramming for tests generally results in lower overall grades.You pump your brain with information, but it’s only stored in spotty, short-term memory.

, One of the reasons cramming for tests isn’t very effective is because students who cram typically do not get enough sleep the night before an exam. The general rule of thumb is that those between 5-9 years old need 10-11 hours of sleep per night, and those between 10-18 years old need 8½-9½ hours of sleep per night to perform well in school.College students should get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Getting enough sleep will make your work higher-quality and your time spent more efficiently. You also won’t find yourself nodding off in class, which doesn't impress teachers.


Going to bed with your laptop, smart phone or TV on is a bad idea. Research shows it makes getting to sleep much harder.Also avoid caffeine products, such as soda, coffee and chocolate, for several hours before going to bed. It can take 6 hours for caffeine to leave your system, often making it hard to fall asleep., Teachers often feel both excited and that they’re doing a good job when a student takes the initiative to learn more about the topics being studied in class. If you find something cool online about the Argentine horned frog, for instance, that relates to a class discussion on amphibians, print off the article and give it to your teacher the next time class meets.Ultimately, your teachers want you to learn. That’s what makes them most happy.

Be respectful in and out of class.,
Follow directions.,
Pay attention to the lesson or lecture.,
Participate in class.,
Strive to do well.",How to Make Your Teacher Happy2," From passing your teacher in the hall and saying, respectively, “Hello, Mr. James,” to a smile at him upon entering his classroom, pleasant manners are fundamental and necessary if you want your teacher to like you. A huge component of respecting your teacher is listening to your teacher. You are there to learn, and your teacher is there to teach. Also make sure to use good manners with other students by not interrupting them, or by being sarcastic or putting them down.”Please,” “thank you” and “excuse me” are appropriate signs of respect at any time.
When your teacher is teaching to the class or directly speaking to you, maintain eye contact. It shows you are listening, interested and engaged. It’s a compliment to your teacher.

, Directions in school are either instructions regarding how to do something or they’re rules. You want to follow both. It shows your teacher that you’re not only listening but that you also have respect for his or class rules. One of those rules is often to raise your hand when you have a question, when you wish to make a comment or if you need to be excused from class to, for example, use the restroom. Listening and following directions span numerous areas of your life, and school is no different., A classroom with kids scampering about or a lecture hall full of busy student fingers moving over smart phones are not a teacher’s dream come true. Instead envision a quiet class in which everyone is facing the teacher, listening to the lecture. That’s what a teacher wants to see, and how you should behave in class. Your teacher will notice, and it will be appreciated.Be aware of your body language. Sit up straight. It shows you care and are involved. Slouching to the side, with your head in your hand, can be considered quite rude by teachers.
Make sure you take good notes in class, which also shows you’re paying attention, focusing on what’s important and not letting your mind wander. Notes are also a written record of what your teacher says in class and will help you do well on assignments and tests.
If you’re having a really hard time focusing in class, talk to your teacher and to your parents.

, One of the most effective ways to your teacher’s heart is by being engaged in class discussions, asking questions, and responding thoughtfully to new ideas and facts. In life, people respond positively to you when you show an interest in what they like or in what they are doing, making or discussing. It’s the same with teachers. You also want to participate effectively and respectfully in groups.


When working in groups, don’t be overbearing and take over the group. But also don’t be the one who doesn’t do much on the group assignment or project. Be an active member.While participating in open class discussions and asking questions is encouraged, be careful not to overdo it. Make sure others have plenty of time to talk and ask questions, too., The biggest “thank you” you can give your teacher, and the surest way to make him or her happy and proud, is by excelling. Many people get into teaching because they want to have a positive impact on students and the world. They want to see passion, creativity and knowledge grow. They want to feel like they’ve made a difference in their students’ lives. Show your teacher he or she has had a positive impact on you by producing high-quality work that is neat, legible, carefully put together and always turned in on time.Make sure you are consistent. Doing really well only the first week or two to make a good first impression won’t be enough. It will later make your teacher think you aren’t living up to your potential.If you put in the time and effort to do well the duration of the class, you will reap the rewards of your teacher’s high regard.
If you do a lot of in-class work and are able to sit wherever you want, choose a seat away from talkative friends. This will let you focus and word hard, which your teacher will happily see.

Put away the electronic gadgets.,
Save the clowning around for another time.,
Don’t bully other students or the teacher.,
Avoid unnecessary chatter.,
Don’t sleep in class.,
Don’t lie to your teacher.",How to Make Your Teacher Happy3," Students across the U.S. are increasingly taking cell phones, smart phones, tablets and laptops to school. Teachers, in response, are getting increasingly frustrated when students stealthily text and play games in class or when laptop screens display Facebook instead of the web page on body anatomy being discussed. While in class, put away the electronics, or only use them for the purpose of the class. Using them for other reasons is rude and will upset your teacher.If you have a special situation and need to have your phone with you, talk with your teacher about the situation. Ask if you can have it on vibrate during class.
While some classes now utilize smart phones for exercises and assignments, leave yours in your locker or at home if you think you might be temped to pull it out during a class in which you don't need it.

, While other students might find your antics and jokes hilarious, your teacher will find them not only obnoxious but also disruptive to class. Avoid speaking out of turn. Don’t crack jokes at the expense of others, including your teacher. Save the playful head chokes, wrestling and noogies for after class., Bullying has become such a problem in schools that organizations and policy groups have formed to help combat it, schools have implemented strict anti-bullying policies and teachers have taken classes to learn how to better manage it. If you want your teacher to like you, definitely do not be THE BULLY. Don’t interrupt and argue with other students in an intimidating manner. Don’t yell at them or call them names, especially using profanity. Don’t threaten them, whether verbally, in writing or with your body language.Don't bully your teachers either. They are in charge, not you!
Remember: Bullying not only has very negative consequences in terms of your relationship with your teacher. It can get you kicked out of school, or worse.

, Most teachers will not want you to talk or whisper (rarely will you whisper as quietly as you think) while they are talking or while students are working on an assignment or taking a test. You also shouldn’t stop by a friend’s desk to talk, if only for a few seconds, when you get up to sharpen your pencil or a drink from the water fountain. When working in groups, limit your talking to the project at hand, not the latest gossip or the best and worst plays in the NCAA semi-finals. It’s disrespectful and distracting.Also, don’t pass notes in class. When passing notes, you might as well be shouting to your friend from across the room while your teacher attempts to teach you how to simplify square roots in Algebra. It's simply that obvious to everyone.

, It drives teachers crazy to see a student’s head bobbing sleepily during a lesson or lecture or to watch a student lean forward on his desk to lay his head on his arm as soon as the lights go out for a video. By doing this, you’re sending a clear message to your teacher – “What you’re teaching isn’t all that interesting or important to me, and I don’t care too much about following the rules.” That’s not the message you want to send to make your teacher happy. It’s also awkward, or worse, when you have to be awoken.If you find yourself overwhelmingly and consistently tired in class, and simply unable to stay awake, talk with your teacher about it. You probably aren’t getting enough sleep and need to readjust your schedule.

, The “I thought it was due next week” when you’d been reminded repeatedly of the due date or “I was really sick last night and wasn’t able to finish the conclusion,” not knowing your teacher happened to be at the movie theater the previous evening, too – are all excuses, lies, that you should never, never tell your teacher. Lying is one of teachers’ biggest pet peeves. Also, once you’ve been caught, you can forget about leniency when something actually does happen to prevent you from turning in an assignment on time.The best option is to not get in the situation in the first place.
If you do, however, the best thing to do is tell the truth. Your teacher won’t be happy with the choice you made leading to not completing the assignment, but he or she will respect you for admitting it.

Make the notes as small as possible.,
Write the message on a spare scrap of paper, ideally when the teacher is writing on the board or talking to a classmate across the room.,
Fold the note.,

Pass it to the left or right of you.,
Pass it in front of you.,
Receive the note from behind you.,
Receive the note from the sides.,
Receive the note from in front of you.,
Slip notes into an information book.,
Try the pen method.,
Use the bathroom method.,
Pretend you dropped something.,
Drop it on the desk.",How to Pass Notes in Class Without the Teacher Spotting You," Smaller notes are easier to hide. Make small pieces of paper (about 3 by 5 inches/7.5cm x 12.5cm) to pass in-between you and your friend. Perhaps make the little note papers outside of class and keep them ready stashed in your pencil case, to avoid having the teacher ask you to stop tearing paper during class.;
, If the teacher looks at you, don't immediately scramble to hide the note; that'll look too suspicious. Just casually cover it with a textbook or a pencil case. Whatever you do, don't write any names on the note because if the teacher finds it, they'll know who wrote it and attempted to pass it.

, If you have normal paper, as in notebook paper, fold it in half four times, be quiet though! If you have a note card or the 3x5 pieces of paper, fold it once.

, If somebody you want to pass to is behind you, don't turn around and put it on their desk. Instead, hold the note, put your hand behind your back, and raise it up to your neck. Then drop it on their desk. Make sure they notice it.

, Don't do the 'I'll-just-drop-it-on-the-floor-maneuver.' Put the note in a book, somewhere they can find it (in the front cover, etc). Then pass the book to them. Try to do it when the teacher isn't looking though, because the teacher will get suspicious about you passing books back and forth.

, Put the note on their shoulder the first time. After that, drop it in their seat or behind their neck.

, Once you hear the other person folding the paper, act as if you're scratching your back, then retrieve the note.

, Just continue to pass the book.

, Quite simple, the sender should do all of the work.

, If you have an information book, and the person you need to send your note to asks to borrow it, get their note and secretly slip it in an obvious page. Remember to add something that makes them know they are the one to read your message.


You can say what page number the note is on. For example: ""Here's your 201 book back."" The 201 represents the page number.

, Beforehand, tell a friend about this method, and try to find a signal for starting the pass, such as tapping your feet in a certain way. Roll your note and get out a pen. Take the ink cartridge out of the pen. This leaves an empty pen shaft, perfect for notes. Place your note inside the pen shaft, then tap your foot or start the signal. Your friend will ask to borrow a pen. Give them the pen with the note. The person you are passing the note to can be returned either when the teacher is not looking or when class is over.

, Pretend to go to the bathroom. While passing the person who you want to give it to, drop the note on their desk. Make sure they notice it and make sure the teacher doesn't see you do it.

, Someone tosses a note on the floor for you. You drop your pencil in the same spot and lean over to pick it up, picking up the note at the same time.

, Go to the back or the front of the classroom, depending on where the person is, and casually drop it on their desk while passing by. You might want to have an excuse, such as trying to read something on the board, looking for a wall chart or retrieving an item from a different part of the classroom, etc.

Schedule meetings with parents with a fairly wide window.,

In a few weeks, follow up on the conference with an email, note in the student's agenda, letter in the mail, or phone call.",How to Make Parents Feel Comfortable During a Parent or Teacher Conference," Meetings never run as efficiently and quickly as you would think. What you expect should take twenty minutes will invariably turn into forty. Don't schedule a parent meeting to occur fifteen minutes before the students come back from lunch.;
, If other teachers are coming as well, make sure that they remember the time and location through email reminder or note. Have a plan to quickly locate and retrieve those staff members if they have forgotten.

, That includes papers to grade, your water bill, cell phone, or laptop (no surfing the net at this time).

, This includes work samples, behavior log, current report card or class average, and details of missing assignments if you plan to allow the child to make up missing work.

, Many times there is something discussed that requires one of the people at the meeting to do some follow-up activity. Don't assume you'll remember what you discussed or promised to do later. Write it down. You may want to provide a small pad of paper and pen for parents too, as many of them don't bring anything to write with.

, Try to seat yourself next to them rather than across from them. If there are multiple staff members attending, make sure that you don't physically seat yourselves together apart from the parent. Try for more of a circular seating pattern than a panel style arrangement. Parents are already nervous, and many feel intimidated when they are alone in a chair facing a line of teachers.

, Hopefully you haven't gotten this far into the year without that knowledge, but be sure of it before you start. You'll also want to make sure you know the relationship of the visiting adult to the child in question. Don't assume it is a mom or dad. The visitor might actually be the child's aunt, grandfather, or even a foster parent. Find out who you are dealing with.

, If there are multiple teachers present, introduce the parent to them. You can simply say, ""Okay, let's get started. This is Ms. Smith, Jimmy Smith's mom. She's here today to talk with us about Jimmy's work in our classes."" As each teacher gets a turn to talk to the parent, he or she can introduce herself at that time.

, Parents like to hear what their children are doing well. It should be specific and genuine, however, as parents are already wary and expectant of bad news. Even if the child is a holy terror, there is something good that can be said of them. ""Jimmy really has a lot of friends"" or ""Jimmy is always surprising us with his unique ideas.""

, You don't need to be mean, but you shouldn't sugar coat the truth either. If the student is failing in science, tell the parents why. Be prepared to show a print out or record of missing assignments, failed quizzes, or whatever the problem is.

, For example, if the child isn't keeping up with workbook pages, bring a workbook to show the parents what the child should be doing. If the child isn't passing tests, bring the study guide you use to show parents what you are giving the students to prepare them for the tests. Tell the parents briefly about how your class works in respect to the area in which the child is struggling: how often you give homework, what you do to review for a test, how students are required to keep a notebook, or how tests always fall on Fridays.

, Write any important information on the top of it, such as due date, or credit possible (50% for late work). Make any notes on the work about what resource the student should use (pages 3-9 of the social studies book), because if the work is already overdue, chances are the student won't remember how it was supposed to be done.

, Encourage them to express their concerns. During the meeting, pause to ask them questions such as: Does this make sense? Do you find that this happens at home? What is the best way for me to get in touch with you if I need to let you know more about my concerns? What does your child say about my class? Does he seem to enjoy it? How has he performed in the past with math/etc.?

, Education, like any other field, is riddled with acronyms that only make sense to other educators. Be plain with your communication. If you must use an acronym, be sure and explain it to the parent (IEP, SST, EIP, MO, ELL, LAB, etc.)

, Refer to the notes you took during the meeting, for example: ""Okay Ms. Smith, so what I have understood today is that Ms. James and I are going to make sure that Jimmy is moved closer to the front of them room in our classes. Mr. Ellis is going to be sending some makeup work home in math, and Ms. Lewis has given you some makeup work today for social studies that you will make sure Jimmy has back by next Monday. Does this all sound correct?"" Be sure and ask at that point if the parent has any questions for anyone.

, Express your knowledge that they have taken time out of their busy schedule, and how you wish that all other parents were as conscientious. Make sure that the parent has knowledge of how to contact you, and that know they are welcome to do so at any time. Shake hands with them, and lead them to the door. (Make sure they took anything with them that you gave them, such as the makeup work!)

, If the student has improved, say so. If the problems are continuing, the parent needs to know.

Avoid lying habitually.",How to Make Up a Good Excuse for Your Homework Not Being Finished," One of the easiest and most believable excuses is simply blaming technology. You can say your computer crashed, your printer broke, your internet was down, or any number of problems. Most people, your teacher included, have experienced setbacks due to technological problems.This is a great excuse if you had a paper you needed to type and print. It may also work if you have homework you had to do online. You could say you did the whole assignment, but then your internet cut out and you couldn't save anything.
It might be a bad idea to claim your printer stopped working. Your teacher may request you e-mail him/her the assignment instead, which you won't be able to do if you never did it. Teachers may also suggest you should have printed an assignment at a local library or FedEx instead of coming in with nothing.;
, You can use your family situation to your advantage. What is your family situation like? Are there any unique circumstances that could arise due to that situation?


If your parents are divorced, for example, you can claim you were at your mom's last night, but left your textbook with your dad this weekend. Many teachers are sympathetic to children from divorced homes. Your teacher may take pity on you if you use an excuse like this.Do you have any younger siblings? You could claim you had to babysit your little sister and she got sick, resulting in your being distracted from your homework., You can tell your teacher you were sick the night before. Claim you couldn't get any work done, but did not want to risk missing school on top of missing homework. Your teacher may take pity on you and admire that you came into school despite not feeling well.


You can try running around in the playground or hallways before class. This can help you look flushed and warm. If you look sick, your teacher will be more likely to believe you.
However, keep in mind some teachers may require a note from your parents in the event of illness. If your teacher typically demands proof of sickness, you may want to avoid using this excuse.

, Try saying something like, ""I didn't understand the assignment. I tried really hard, but I don't get it. Can we talk after school?"" Your teacher's job is to help you understand a given subject. He or she will admire your willingness to learn if you claim you simply did not understand. Your teacher may be more willing to overlook a late or missing assignment if you seem genuinely invested in learning., Come into class looking panicked, and tell your teacher you cannot find an assignment in your binder or folder. If you act panicked enough, your teacher is likely to believe you're telling the truth. He or she may give you an extra day to get the work finished.Avoid saying you left your homework at home. Your teacher may request you call your mom or dad to have it delivered to the school. This will reveal you are lying.
Try not to use this excuse more than once or twice a term; otherwise, your teacher may see you as disorganized and be less sympathetic towards you if you need to make other excuses in the future.

, You can always say you have a busy schedule. Blame extracurricular activities and homework for other classes. If you're generally a diligent student, this may work. Your teacher may take pity on you if he or she believes you're genuinely overwhelmed.


Be careful using this excuse if you're not busy. If you're usually late for classes and do not engage in many extracurricular activities, your teacher may catch onto the fact you're lying.

, You may be inclined to simply play dumb. For example, you may claim you forgot you had an assignment at all. This approach is likely to backfire. Forgetting an assignment is as bad as simply refusing to do an assignment. Your teacher will be unlikely to take pity on you and you'll probably receive a ""0"" as a grade.


Never lie you were absent on the day the homework was set. One glance of the register is all it takes for your teacher to see right through this excuse.

, Before lying to a teacher, consider his or her personality. This can have an impact on how you should deliver your excuse.If your teacher is particularly strict, be prepared to answer a lot of questions. A stricter teacher is likely to grill you, poking holes in your excuse. For example, say you claim you couldn't turn in your online math homework because your internet cut out. A strict teacher might respond with something like, ""Then why didn't you go do your homework at a coffee shop?"" Have a response ready. Try something like, ""My mom was working and there was no one to drive me.""Do you know anything about your teacher's personal interests? This can help you gauge what excuse may work for this person. For example, you know your chemistry teacher is the oldest of 7 children. He may be more sympathetic to a story about how watching your younger siblings kept you from getting your work done., The briefer your excuse, the easier it will be to remember. When making up an excuse for a teacher, keep your story short. Going into excessive detail can seem suspicious and you'll also be more likely to accidentally change aspects of your story.Stick to only the important details. For example, say you're planning on claiming your piano recital got out late, and this is why you didn't finish your math homework. Do not go overboard with the details. Simply say, ""A few students played their solos too long, so we didn't get done until 9:30 and it was a 45 minute drive home."" Do not say, ""Chester Mifflin spent 25 minutes on his routine, when we were only given 10, and then Lisa Gregory was little late getting up on stage..."" The longer your lie, the more unbelievable it sounds. Most people would not remember this much detail.
If your teacher presses you for specifics, you can improvise as needed, but avoid excessive detail. For example, your teacher might ask, ""How long did the recital run over?"" Do not say, ""It was supposed to run until 8:30 but it was 9:23 when we got out."" Instead, say something somewhat vague, like, ""I'd say about 45 minutes.""

, You want to give a story that's plausible. For example, using the above scenario as an excuse could work great. However, you should only use it if you actually had a piano recital that night. While you may have been lying about it running over, if your teacher checks the facts he'll see at least the basics are true. This means you're more likely to be believed., After giving your excuse, jot down some of the details. This can be especially helpful if you had to improvise during the lying process. Lies are often detected because the story changes over time. If you take an effort to remember the details you gave, your story will stay consistent. This can make your story more believable to others.

, Many people have unconscious physical signs that indicate they're lying. You may stutter excessively, fidget, or avoid eye contact when lying.Try to avoid appearing physically nervous when telling your story.


Take a few deep breaths before going into the room to help yourself stay calm.
Make eye contact with your teacher most of the time.
Be conscious of what you're doing with your body. Try to avoid fidgeting excessively.

, Before making up an excuse, try to consider the consequences of getting caught. Review your school's policy regarding lying to teachers.


Refer to the syllabus for that class. There may be a section about honesty that goes over the consequences of lying to a teacher.
You should also look at your school's handbook, if you have a copy. See if there are any sections about what happens if you breach academic honesty policies.
Consequences can vary from teacher-to-teacher. In some cases, you may only get a strict talking to. However, some teachers may be required to report these kinds of behaviors to the principal and your parents. This could land you in more serious trouble both at home and at school.

, What would happen if you simply told your teacher you forgot to do the assignment? What are the consequences of late and missing work in that class?


It may depend on the assignment. Late work may not be accepted, but if the assignment is only worth 10 points, is this really a big deal? However, if the assignment is worth 15% of your grade, it may be worth it to ask for an extension.
Talk to other students who've had this teacher in the past. How has this teacher reacted to late or missing work? Some teachers may accept late work for lower points. Some teachers may allow you to turn in work late if it's your first time. If this is the case, it may be a good idea to simply admit you didn't do the assignment.

, Once you've looked into the consequences for getting caught lying and admitting you didn't do the assignment, compare and contrast. This can help you decide if lying to your teacher is really worth the risk.


You can make a pro and con list for each scenario. Write down the possible benefits and possible drawbacks of each option. For example, you can write on the top of a piece of paper ""Lying To My Teacher"" and then have two columns, one for ""pro"" and one for ""con."" Under ""pro,"" you may write something like, ""Assignment is worth a lot of points - an extension could help my overall grade."" Under ""con,"" you could write, ""If Ms. Davies finds out I'm lying, she will report it to the principal and I'll get detention for a week.""
Weigh the pros and cons. If the pros outweigh the cons heavily for one option, this may be the right choice for you.

, You do not want to be in a situation where you have to make up an excuse again. If you're making a lot of excuses over and over again, your teacher is likely to catch on. Try to make an effort to prioritize your homework to avoid this problem in the future.


Do your homework every day after school. Do not do anything else, like playing video games or playing outside, before finishing your work.
Write down all the assignments you have to do. Make sure to write down an assignment after a teacher mentions it. This way, you won't forget.

, If you're trying to get on a better study schedule, seek outside help. Tell your parents you want to make homework a priority. Explain to your friends you're trying to be a better student. Ask them if they want to study with you, or if they can avoid inviting you out while you're working.


If you habitually struggle to get your homework done, and have an overall inability to concentrate, this can be a symptom of Attention Deficit Disorder. Talk to your parents about getting tested for ADD.

, You should not make a habit out of lying to your teacher about homework assignments. In the event a real emergency comes up, your teacher may not believe you if you've lied in the past. Moving forward, try to do your homework on time. In the event you do not complete an assignment, be honest. This will reflect better on you than habitually lying.

You'd probably want your students to quiet down and do their work, too. Try to imagine how your teacher must feel on a daily basis to give you some clues on how to act, if you want your teacher to like you.


Try to take it easy on your teacher. Don't make your teacher have to work harder than they already have to. Every time you have an excuse or a favor or a request you have to make for your teacher, that's more work for them. Give them less to do.;
, There's no one way to please all your teachers, since all your teachers will be completely different people. Some will be kind, easy-going, and warm, while others will seem like stern, old-school taskmasters. Try to get a read on who your teacher is, what they like, and what makes them tick, to learn more.


If your teacher is stern, sucking up won't do you much good. Focus on your work, putting your head down, and doing what's expected, not in being a big presence in class.
If your teacher is kind of warm, they'll likely more appreciate the talkers in class. If you want the teacher to like you, open up and talk a bit more and have a short conversation with the teacher if necessary, as well as doing your work as well as you can.

, Contrary to what you might think, teachers don't like brown-noses, suck-ups, or annoying tattle-tales. The person in your class you think is the ""teacher's pet"" according to the students is probably not most teacher's favorite student. Keep that in mind.


It's not necessary to be the most talkative, or to ask more questions than everyone else. Just make sure that you contribute sometimes and that you keep the classroom positive.

, If you want to go the extra mile, it's helpful to have a creative spin to put on your work to help yourself stand out from the rest of the students and interesting, creative, and likable. Think of creative projects when you get projects, or do your in-class work in different ways than everyone else. Try to hard and do more than the minimum.


Imagine this: your teacher has to sit down and grade twenty, fifty, even a couple hundred papers at night. How boring if they're all exactly the same. But if you can inject a bit of your own personality and creativity into your work (as long as you follow instructions and do the work you're supposed to do), most teachers will like that.

, Be honest when you're in school. As you get older and go through school, teachers will respect students who learn to think for themselves, not students who just repeat what they've heard. If you display, at any age, that you're a creative, independent thinker, that'll be something to respect.


Speaking your mind doesn't mean being a troublemaker in class. If you don't want to do the homework because it's boring, that's not going to win you any points.

, At some point in your time as a student, you should pick a teacher that you especially like and say, ""Thank you."" It's hard work being a teacher, and they'll appreciate your appreciation.


In some cases, small gifts can be appropriate ways of saying thanks, but some teachers might take offense, if the gift seems overly elaborate, expensive, or fancy. Gifts should not seem like bribes.
In some cultures, it's appropriate and quite common to invite your teacher to dinner with your family. Extending an invitation can be a polite way of saying thanks.

, The single best way to get any teacher to look on you favorably is to pay attention in class. The more you pay attention and listen closely, the easier it will be for you to settle down when you're supposed to, and do your best work possible.


If you struggle to pay attention in class, talk to your parents and your teacher to let them know. It's possible you may not being challenged enough, or might have some behavioral problems that need help so you can do your best.
Even though it's fun to sit next to your friends, try to hang out with them at recess, on the bus, and during passing periods. It might be better to sit away from them in class, to avoid the temptation to fool around. You might miss important things.

, When you're in school, you need to do what you're supposed to do as quickly and quietly as possible. If it's time to put away your things and go to lunch, that doesn't mean it's time to joke with your neighbor and stick your gum under the desk. Listen and follow instructions.


Follow your teacher's instructions when you're not in the classroom as well. If you have to read a chapter from a book for class tomorrow, do it. Don't skip assignments and think the teacher will like you because you're friendly. Just do your work.

, It's very important that you be respectful and kind to not only your teacher, but to everyone else in class as well. Treat the other people in your class like you would want to be treated at all times.


Don't talk in class when it's not the right time. Teachers will not be happy at improper interruptions.
Some kids think pushing the teachers buttons is a good way of getting other kids to like them, but this is disrespectful to everyone, especially the teacher.

, When you're in class, you need to do more than just sit silently and pay attention. Often, your teacher will ask for volunteers, or ask questions of the group, and it's important to speak up at appropriate times. Work hard to make the class environment positive.


Work in small groups politely. When it's time to break into groups, do your part in the group to help the task along, not make trouble, interrupt, or just sit and wait for the other students to do your work for you.
If you see other students around you acting up or talking, you don't need to make a big deal of it, but you can also help keeping class moving forward by putting your nose down and doing the work. Don't let yourself get distracted.

, Take pride in keeping your desk, locker, coat space in the coat closet, and whatever other space you've got in the classroom and orderly and clean as possible. Your teacher isn't your parent, and shouldn't have to clean up after you on a regular basis. There's no better way to make your teacher not like you, than to make a big mess in the classroom.

, During class, focus and do your in-class assignments as best as possible, follow instructions that you've been given, and turn in your work. Getting your teacher happy doesn't need to be much more complicated than that.


When you get homework assignments, save enough time to finish them efficiently. A good way to tick off your teacher is doing your homework last minute, right before you turn it in.
Never, under any circumstances, should you cheat or copy answers from someone in your class. That's a good way to get in trouble.

, Teachers like a student who joins in when it's time, and not just sits in the back of the room, head down. Ask intelligent or meaningful questions. Show you are listening while your teacher is talking.


Often, if you have a question, a bunch of other students will have the same question, they're just too afraid to ask it. Being willing to ask questions will help to make your teacher like you.

, This should be an easy one. When you go to class and interact with your teacher, Try to put yourself at ease and just be yourself. If you try to be pretend to be someone you're not, your teacher will be able to tell. Don't just try to be a teacher's pet, a know-it-all, or too-cool-for-school. Just be you.


Teachers are like anyone else: they like people to be genuine, kind, and real. Don't mistake yourself into thinking that you need to be a certain way to get teachers to like you. Just don't act up to get attention, and you'll be well-liked by teachers.

, Try hard in school and only turn in your best work. If teachers think that you're capable of more in class, they'll be unhappy if you're not trying hard. Don't mail it in. Really set aside enough time to get your work done at a high level. Go the extra mile on homework assignments.


If you're struggling in class, tell your teacher that you want to do better, and ask for help. At lots of schools, there are after-school homework groups, study sessions, and other ways that you can get extra work done, if you make the effort. Teachers respect effort.

These goals might be social, intellectual, or physical, but by having something to work toward, you can relieve some anxiety about starting up again. Some goals you might consider:Making new friends
Joining a club (or starting your own)
Getting better grades
Getting in shape;
, Or, if you didn't have homework assigned over break, take some time to look over the last assignments you did in each class before leaving school. This will remind you of where you left off in class, and looking over homework can prevent you from forgetting to complete it.Take this time also to reflect on the way you've done homework in the past. If you can think of any improvements you might make to your homework routine, returning to school might be the perfect time to make a change.

, This might be a teacher of your favorite subject, or a teacher who sponsors a club to which you belong. Ask if you might join this teacher during lunch to tell him about your adventures over vacation, or if you could work on homework in his room after school.


If your favorite teacher is busy that day, see if he has time to catch up later on in the week.

, There may be a field trip in a week or two, or maybe your science class has a cool experiment planned - whatever it might be, chances are you have something to look forward to when you return to school. By making a list of these things, you can replace any fear you have of going back with excitement to return., There's no getting around it, you'll need some time before it feels normal going to school again. Don't be hard on yourself. This process can take a week or two, but coach yourself through your negative thoughts by saying things like:""It's normal to be a little nervous returning to something after a long break. Everything's going to be alright!""
""Most kids don't want to go back to school any more than I do. But at least I'll be able to see my friends! I can't wait to tell them about my adventures.""

, Over the course of your vacation, you might have enjoyed sleeping in or staying up late. This might make it difficult getting back into your school routine. To reset your sleep schedule you should:


Return to your routine several days to a week ahead of time.
Open blinds to get natural light in the mornings.
Skip late night meals.
Limit your stimulants, like caffeine and energy drinks., It's likely you'll still be adjusting back to your school routine when break is over, and pre-packing school supplies and choosing your outfit the night before can save you time and stress. Grogginess in the morning can cause you to take more time than you need to do these simple tasks, so ready your stuff before to make your first morning back as easy as possible.


You might also want to pack your lunch the night before, if you take your lunch to school.
You might benefit from making a back-to-school checklist. Write down all necessary supplies, like books, a calculator, pencils, notebooks, and so on.

, Sleep deprivation is terrible for your body, and can result in breakouts of acne, weight gain, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. Protect your health and make the first day back to school after break easier on yourself by getting the sleep you need, which for most teens is between 8½ and 9½ hours, but this might be different for you., Your first day back to school after break, you'll be out of practice doing your normal routine, which will likely add more time than you expect. Try to wake up a little earlier than normal so that you have extra time to make sure you have everything you need to succeed., Foods like whole grain toast, eggs, yogurt, and cottage cheese can give you an emotional boost and keep you going throughout the day.


Regular healthy breakfasts might also improve your memory, daily energy levels, your sense of calmness, and even your mood!, A little bit of exercise before you head to school can put some pep in your step and make you feel better about the day.Light exercise will also help you wake up, and will get your blood flowing. This will provide more oxygen to your brain and give you more mental sharpness. Some light exercise to consider:


Cycling
Jumping jacks
Stretching

Walking, Even if you don't have any brothers and sisters, it can be difficult for your parents to keep track of all the things they need to and your schedule. Help your parents out by creating a family schedule on a calendar. You may want to include:Meet days for sports
Club activities
Important test days

, Consistency, as they say, is key, and by staying true to your routine it will become easier and less stressful with each passing day.A consistent routine will also help you readjust your sleep schedule, and can help you maintain discipline studying., Keep your parents up to date not only with your school activities, but also with your feelings. Your parents might have some good advice for beating the back-to-school blues, or might have an idea to cheer you up. When talking with your parents, you might say something like:""Dad, I knew I had to go back to school all break, but now that it's here I'm really bummed about it. Could we go to the movies next weekend, just you and me, as a treat for making it through the first week?""

, Even the best routines aren't safe from the randomness of life. Whether it's a looming test, like the ACT or SAT, or something fun, like a concert, there are always things that you'll have to adjust your routine around. Continue tweaking your routine until it fits your life well, and next time you have vacation, returning to school after break will be a cinch.

Review what you learned last year.,
Look ahead.,
Set specific goals.,
Pick a study space.,
Acknowledge your typical distractions.",How to Prepare for the New School Year1," You don’t have to study for long hours. This can be as simple as reviewing the subjects that you studied and skimming summaries of the books that you read last year. A quick refresher will get your mind ready for studying and make the first weeks back easier as you can see them as a continuation of progress that you have made.


Reread your notes. Your class notes will remind you of the material you covered previously, as well as your initial reactions to the material. Do not worry if you don’t fully understand all of the concepts that you review: reexamining and rediscovering specific ideas is a natural part of the learning process.
Make a list of what you have learned. If you did not take notes, or did not save them, try a more active approach and list the subjects that you studied the previous year. Look at a report card or transcript if you need. Then, list major lessons and ideas that were covered beneath each subject. You likely cannot remember everything, but the act of recalling previous progress will get your mind ready for mental work.;
, Get a list of what you will be studying in your classes and get a sense for what you will be learning. You don’t have to work ahead if you don’t want. Simply having a sense for what you will be covering will prepare you for success.


You may not be given a syllabus or required book list in advance. Some teachers and schools will be happy to supply this information if you ask. Others may not be willing or able to supply this information. Ask politely and be gracious if denied.

, If you want to get straight A’s, you can develop a study routine with time dedicated to each class before the year starts. If there is a specific subject that you want to excel in, check out introductory books from your local library. If you want to focus on making friends, explore your school’s clubs and activities to find an interesting option that fits your schedule. These are not mutually exclusive goals, but it will help if you know what is most important to you.

, A good study space will mean different things for different people, and it can change from year to year. As the school year approaches, many news outlets suggest ideas for creating an effective study space.Pick a study space that is conducive to your goals. If you want to master a complicated subject, you may need to study in a library so that you can access relevant books. If you want to make new friends, look for a café where you can talk with other customers while studying.

, If you can, eliminate distractions in your work space or during set times. If you find it hard to ignore a television, find a suitable study space with no televisions in sight. If noise distracts you, look for a desk in a quiet corner of the library or purchase noise-cancelling headphones.

Purchase all required supplies.,
Pack your school bag.,
Pack a special bag for crisis items.,
Check your pockets.",How to Prepare for the New School Year2," Your school may provide a list of materials that you will need, or you may need to make your own list of the supplies that you will need. Major retailers like Target and Walmart, as well as pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS, typically run promotional sales during the weeks leading up to the school year: you can often get all of the supplies that you need in one stop.


Plan ahead. While stores usually advertise back-to-school sales, some items may be cheaper during other sales. For example, clothing may be cheaper during end-of-summer clearance sales held before the back-to-school sales. Get your list ready in advance, and look for deals throughout the summer.Check for additional student discounts. Keep your student ID handy as some retailers offer discounts if you can show that you are a student. Ask a salesperson or look online for a list of major retailers with discounts., Get your supplies ready in advance so that you will have a chance to double check that you have everything. Make sure that your bag is large enough to carry the items that you will need daily. Use the sections of your backpack or organizational supplies to make all of your supplies easily accessible.


Make sure you have folders to collect loose papers and assignments. You might lose important information or undermine your success by turning in damaged work.
Plan to have extras of the most essential items. It is easy to lose a pencil before an important test, so have several writing utensils stashed in your bag.

, Pack a small bag or a compartment in your backpack with items that can help in emergencies. For example, a pack of tissues can be ready in case you get a runny nose in class and a bandage can help if you get a papercut while reaching into your bag. Try to buy mini sizes so that you don't take up a lot of space in your school bag.


Some items that might help you in a pinch: a pack of gum or breath spray, lip balm, a few adhesive bandages, a packet of tissues, antibacterial gel, oil blotting sheets, a compact mirror and makeup, sanitary pads/tampons, tweezers.
Try not to advertise your preparation as other students may take advantage of your foresight and ask to use your supplies. If you aren’t careful, you'll eventually be left with nothing. If people are pestering you for gum, try carrying an empty gum packet as evidence that you're chewing your last piece.
Keep your essential items separate from your books or they may break in your bag. They may even leak and ruin your books if not kept in an individual pouch or bag.

, Make sure that you have enough space for the items you plan on carrying with you daily. You will want to keep necessities like your phone, headphones, a bus pass, and keys nearby for safe keeping and so that you don't have to spend too much time hunting for them when needed. If you wear a blazer, or have front pockets in your bag, you can use them for small items that could get lost in a bigger pouch

Start a sleep schedule.,
Study at set times.,
Time your morning preparations.,
Schedule appointments.",How to Prepare for the New School Year3," To function at your best, you will need to be well rested and alert at the start of the school day. If you have kept late hours during summer vacation, you may find it difficult to adjust to the earlier schedule. Since the amount and quality of your sleep impact your academic success,it is important to start this adjustment before classes begin.


Regular sleeping patterns lead to higher quality sleep. Establish a routine of preparation for sleep and a consistent schedule., If you can, study at regular times. Once a pattern is set, you will find it easier to get started and use your time efficiently. On days that you don’t have homework or tests to prepare for, keep the routine by practicing a skill or reading about a topic that interests you beyond class assignments.


Your schedule will likely vary somewhat from day to day, especially if you are involved in sports, clubs, or work. Even if you cannot study on the same day every week, try to develop consistent hours or weekly patterns. For example, if your work schedule changes each week, try to reserve one night early in the week and one night late in the week to complete your assignments.

, Mourning routines are often hurried as you rush to make it to class on time. Before the year begins, make sure you know how much time you will need to prepare in the mourning and prepare to wake up early enough to do so properly.


Plan what you will wear the night before. If your mornings are hectic or stressful, choose the next day’s clothes in advance. This will simplify the hurried morning routine and reduce stress.

, Once the school year starts, you may be rather busy for several weeks or months. As you get ready for the school year, try to schedule a haircut, dentist appointments, and doctor’s appointments. Even if you cannot get everything done before the year starts, it will help to have important meetings scheduled in advance.

Be sure to unwind once you get home.",How to Prepare For The First Day of School," On average, the people who tend to struggle the most with their first days are people who spent too much of their summer indoors and relaxing. While summer should be about having fun and letting loose a little, you should also try to stay active and busy over the course of the summer. There are lots of ways you can go about doing this:



Getting a summer job is a perfect way to stay on your feet. Not only will you be keeping in the swing of proper routine and getting worthwhile experience; you'll also be making some good money while you're at it. Having an extra coin in your pocket will help ensure your summer's as good as it can be.
Joining a sport for the summer is a fun way to spend long hot days, and you'll become more fit as a result.;
, The people who struggle with school the most at first are those who weren't learning over the summer. Learning itself doesn't have to be boring! You can learn about anything you want, whether it's films, history, or avant-garde cinema. Simply keeping your brain in the habit of learning will give you an extra advantage when it comes to going back to school.


If you're keen on getting the best grades and know what classes you'll be taking in advance, you should research some of those course topics in advance. That way, you'll already be a bit of an expert on the subjects before they're even brought up!

, Most schools enroll students based on their catchments, or where they're living. If you have any friends living in the same neighbourhood as you, chances are they'll be going to the same school! Make a point of nurturing stronger bonds with those friends. Spend part of your summer with them, and grow closer. While there's always bound to be some anxiety going into a first day of school, having friends around that care about you makes it much easier.

, Arguably the most important thing you can do in preparing for your first day is making sure you have all of the equipment you need. The types of materials you'll need will vary from class to class. A lot of high school classes will have some sort of online webpage that will post the recommended materials you should bring. Print off a copy for each list of materials and take them to an office supplies store. Certain things, like pens and paper, will be used for virtually all classes, so you can buy a single stack for use throughout your school year. Here are some things you'll almost certainly need for your first day:


A backpack with comfortable shoulder straps.
A sturdy binder, filled with ruled paper.
Pens (red and black) and HB pencils.
Spiral-bound notebooks; one for each class you're enrolled in.
A pair of scissors.
A scientific calculator and graphed paper, if you're doing Mathematics.
A small vial of hand sanitizer.
A portable USB drive, for saving computer work.

, Arranging some reliable transport is a necessary step. It's very important there isn't any question of how you're going to get to school on your first day; things are going to be stressful enough as it is, and you don't want a simple mix-up to get in the way. There are a few likely ways you can get to school:


If you live close enough, you can always walk to school. It's also a good way to exercise and encourage some oxygen flow before your day. Walking will help your stress if you're feeling anxious at all.
You can ask your parents to drive you. Even if they won't always be able to drive you, getting a quick ride over will help make the day as smooth as it can be.
Most schools operate some kind of bus service. Taking one of these buses will bring you right to the school, and you might make some friends on the way!
Joining a carpool is eco-friendly, and a safer bet than constantly relying on your parents.
Public transport is also another eco-friendly option, which can save time and money.

, When you go back to school, you won't have as much time for things like cleaning. Give your room a good tidying; that way, you'll have something clean and relaxing to come home to the next day.

, Especially if you're worried about making a good first impression, choosing the right outfit on your first day can be a nerve-wracking experience! Luckily, you should have lots of time to choose the day before. Find your favourite clothes and lay them neatly beside your bed. That way, you won't be in a rush trying to figure out what to wear.


Any fashion advice depends purely on you at your personality. Ideally, you'll want to wear something casual, comfy, and clean.
If you haven't done so already, it's a good idea to give your outfit a wash in the laundry.
If your school enforces a uniform policy, there are still things you can do to accessorize. Adding buttons or frills to a uniform can give it some zest. Just make sure you're not breaking any policy rules by modifying it!

, You've probably heard similar advice before. While many people are fine with five or six, you're going to need eight to succeed in the coming day, especially if you're looking to make a good impression.Getting enough sleep is even more important if you're 16 or younger! Your body needs more time to rest while it's still growing.


If you've been staying up really late throughout the summer, it is recommended you start to get your sleep schedule on track up to a week in advance of your first school day. That way, you'll have a much easier time adjusting to the new routine.
If you're having trouble getting to sleep, stay away from lit screens and electronics. Try reading a book instead. You'll start to feel tired naturally that way.

, If you've given yourself a proper night of rest, this shouldn't be a problem at all. Set your alarm to give yourself at least an hour to get ready. Drink a fresh glass of cold water. After sleeping for 8 hours, your body will be in need of hydrating, and drinking cold water will give your body a jolt of energy to get you through your morning.

, Have a nice, long shower. Make sure you're clean and look reasonably well-kept. After your shower, put on the outfit you chose the night before. If you decide at the last minute you want a different outfit, you can open your drawers and try something new. Just make sure to watch the clock; you want to give yourself ample time to eat breakfast, and you don't want to risk being late for your first day!


If you have bad skin and want to fix it, you can buy a good toner and skin cream.Applying a skin cream for at least a week should make most of the problem go away.

, There's no underrating what a strong, healthy breakfast can do for the rest of your day. Make sure you incorporate some fruits and vegetables into your breakfast, as they'll be the things that give you energy.Sugary cereals are okay, so long as they're only part of the overall breakfast.


If you're feeling groggy, coffee helps in a pinch. Be sure not to drink too much, however, as an overdose of caffeine will leave you with anxiety and headaches.

, The quickest thing that can hurt your first day is being stressed out over being late. To make sure that doesn't happen, aim to be at school at least fifteen minutes before your first class. This will give you time to find out where your classes are, and you might even spark a conversation with a new friend. Some schools don't count being late for the first week of school.

, Find your class and get there. Once you sit down, be sure to bring out all of the materials you're going to need for the class. If the teacher hasn't said anything so far, a notebook and pencil should do just fine. While you're waiting for the class to start, you can take the opportunity to get to know the classmates around you. Chances are they're feeling some anxiety as well, so getting to know each other may prove to be mutually beneficial.

, Ask questions. Be an integral part of the class. The most important thing you'll want to accomplish with your first day is making a precedent for future great days at school. This includes fostering connections with teachers and classmates, asking questions if you have any, and keeping good notes.


It's a good idea to keep each course's syllabus safe in your binder. There will be times later on in the year where you'll undoubtedly need to reference them. Keep them somewhere you can easily find them, so you can save yourself the embarrassment of having to ask for them again!

, Everyone is technically there to learn, but school is an amazing place to meet friends. Some of the friends you meet at school, you might end up having for the rest of your life. No time's better for meeting people than your first day, so come into the classroom with a smile, and don't be afraid to strike up conversation with other classmates.


If you have social anxiety, being extra brave on your first day and making friends is a good way to help break out of your shyness. You'll soon find the vast majority of the people around you are potential friends you haven't bothered talking to yet!

, School clubs tend to start early in the year, so it's a good idea to look around at billboards. Most schools have lots of great clubs, and no matter what your interests are, you'll find at least a few are catered to an interest of yours? Do you love music? Join the school choir or guitar club. Do you love the cinema of Akira Kurosawa and Lars von Trier? The school's film club might be perfect for you. Clubs are a great way to nurture interests you already have, and a perfect outlet to meet people operating on a similar wavelength.


If you're really interested in something there isn't already a club for, you might want to start a school club yourself!


, While it may sound like too much to handle at once, you should remember that a first day at school should ultimately be a fun experience. You are surrounding yourself with people you'll be spending much of the next year with, and there's no reason why you shouldn't have fun spending time with them. Learn to overcome the anxieties you're feeling, and remember to wear your best smile throughout the day.

, There's nothing like finally coming home after your first day at school. Your first day will feel strangely long compared to other days, largely because of how many different things and people you'll have been exposed to at once. Make sure to treat yourself. Snuggle up and watch your favourite film. Better yet, ask a friend you met earlier that day to hang out and do something together. Relax and feel good; you've made a great start to what should be an amazing year.

Be ready for puberty.",How to Prepare For Junior High," This is your chance to do what you want. In elementary school, everyone knew you and you didn't really want to do something dramatic. In Jr. High, only a few people will know you. So you can do whatever you want to do. Have you always wanted to try out for soccer, but were to afraid? Not anymore. You now have the chance to change your name, change your style, or maybe just give yourself an attitude check. You can also branch out from your old friends, and make new ones. Don't be afraid to be a whole new you in Jr. High.


Another advantage to different schools merging is that being new to the district gets a lot easier. While being a new kid in elementary was difficult as many students have known their classmates since kindergarten, being new in junior high is not an issue as, in a sense, everyone is a new kid as well. In an average middle school about five schools come together, meaning each student won't know other students from at least four schools. This makes it easier to blend in and make friends.;
, With all the hormones rushing through your system, it's very good to get your attitude in shape. You are entering a new chapter of your life, so clear away previous baggage as much as you can, it will hold you back. Keep a positive outlook on your new lifestyle, nobody wants to be around miss Debbie Downer. Socialize with others and respect their beliefs, middle school is when a lot of teens and young teens are finding themselves, so don't be judgmental. Everyone wants to be liked for who they truly are. Complement the commonly forgotten and you'll have yourself a troupe of TRUE friends in no time.

, If you want to have a great time in Jr. High then you have to want it, see it, and feel it. But don't think that when you close your eyes and picture success that it will just magically happen. You have to tell yourself you can do it. You have to work towards it.

, The teachers can answer your questions if you have any, and you will get your schedule and locker combo. You will probably be able to try out your combo on your locker while you're there, and find your classes, too.

, There is a right way to open a combination lock-


Turn right 3 times to the first number.
Turn left PAST zero, 1 time and the stop on the second number.
Turn right to last number and open.

, Use your schedule and a map of the school to draw out your route you will take to all your classes. When you start to get used to school though, your route will probably change as you figure out new shortcuts and your classes change. Remember:


Room 101 is usually on the first floor and room 202 is usually on the second floor.
Water fountains are usually near the bathroom.
Stairways are almost always at the end of the hall.

, When you start Jr. High, you may find yourself waking up earlier than you did in Elementary school—often times Jr. High starts earlier. It's how they fit all their classes into 8 hours. You might have walked to school before but now you have to ride the bus, or you have to be driven to school. Or you might have a lot more activities after-school. Try to get at least 9 hours of sleep a night—if you have to get up 6:00 AM, then you need to be in bed by 9:00 PM at the latest.

, When you buy your school supplies, organize it into a binder. This is best because it will keep you organized as you switch classes. Use dividers for each class and keep pencils in a pencil pouch. Remember organization is one of the most important parts of getting ready for junior high! Another way to get organized is to have folders for every individual subject, and you can carry your pencil bag, planner, etc. to every class.

, Your school will have an ice cream social or meet the teacher night, so take advantage of that time to decorate your locker and get to know the halls a little better.

, The new social scene is pretty new and fun, but don't forget to study too. Get used to taking notes so that you can easily prepare for tests and quizzes. And keep a planner, so you'll never forget another due date. Don't be afraid to ask questions and get help if you need to. It's better to get things as you go along, then to be too shy to ask and end up super confused at the end of the day. And remember, school studies can be fun too. Get a study group together, start the study at Starbucks Club for your BFFs before a test. But don't forget that while study groups are fun, you should still learn from each other. Don't study this way if you just get distracted.

, Everyone's a little nervous on the first couple of days. In about a week everyone will be used to the new teachers, campus, and classes and you'll be making new friends! Once you are used to it, Junior High can be the best years of school!

, First couple of days, the locker room may be a little awkward. Just smile, talk to a friend while changing (if you have a friend in your P.E. class) and do so quickly.


If the shirt of your uniform is pretty long, put the shirt on first and then the pants. Do this backwards after P.E.
The first day changing is always awkward. Be one of the first to change, and try not to act too embarrassed. No one is looking at you or cares what you look like. If you are still scared, wear your P.E. clothes under your uniform clothes.

, Each night before school, look at your planner or calendar to see what's in store for the next day. Set out or think about what your going to wear. Pack your backpack, make sure your homework's done, and have your parents sign any papers that need to be signed. Pack your lunch or tuck away lunch money into your backpack. Shower or bathe now, so you'll be clean for the coming day. The next morning, you'll want to stretch and shower if you didn't the night before. If you did just clean yourself up quickly in the bathroom, get dressed, and have a healthy breakfast. Stay away from sugary cereals. They'll give you a quick energy boost, but then make you feel sluggish throughout the day. Do a quick mirror check then grab your stuff and go.

, Everyone is afraid on the first day. No one cares if you are a few minutes late to class. If you can't open your locker, it's okay. You will eventually make it to every class. The teachers will ease into the homework. Your first period or homeroom teacher will help you with most everything. You can get away with almost anything on the first day. But don't use this to the wrong advantage!

, You won't need to bring all of your supplies on the first day. All you need is a folder, a notebook, and a pencil. Carry all of that around throughout the day. On the other hand, some schools may encourage bringing all your school supplies as soon as possible, so you can be ready as soon as possible.

, Even though you will have extra time on the first day, don't get too used to being late to class. Learn when to stop at you locker. Teachers will tell you that you should go at the beginning of the day, before and after lunch, and at the end of the day. This isn't recommended unless it is more convenient for you that way. Make sure you have enough time for locker stops.

, Chances are you'll hit puberty sometime during junior high, and you want to be ready. Begin washing your face regularly if you don't already to minimize acne. Be sure to wear deodorant every day. Girls, learn how to apply makeup if you're allowed/want to. Carry an emergency kit in case you start your period, too.

Chill out when the day is over.",How to Prepare for the First Day of Middle School (Girls)," You'll need different kinds of clothes or uniform pieces for different purposes: skirts, shorts, slacks, blouses, shirts, jacket/sweater, phys ed setup, scarf/neck-tie (if any). Find out what is needed at your school's open house day.


If your school doesn't have a uniform rule, then wear whatever you want as long as you stay within the dress code. Have a variety of clothing: basics, such as jeans, solid colored t-shirts, and solid jackets. That should make up about 70% of your closet. The other 30% can be weekend t-shirts, splattered/color jeans or trousers, and favorite jackets.
If you're not familiar with the dress code, most of the time it's two finger spacing for tank tops, and shorts have to be eleven inches.
Wear something that the dress code will allow, and try to look as nice as possible. You want to make a good first impression, so dress to impress.;
, Try some earrings, or maybe a necklace or a scarf. Just something to make your outfit look unique and don't go overboard with the make up.

, If you lost it ask a friend, or go to the school website. If you were not given one, check the school website. If they say you don't need anything special on the first day, then bring 2 pencils (mechanical or not), an eraser/eraser tops, leads or a pencil sharpener, and maybe a small, inexpensive good luck charm, or wear your favorite nice-shirt/skirt or such.

, Try to categorise the folder and place worksheets of similar subjects together. This will keep you mess-free and also make things neater for you.

, It's always a good idea to have some pads/tampons in your locker or backpack, just in case (whether you've had your period before or not) you might have it at school. Try placing them in a case along with other things that you might need (e.g. emergency makeup, spare raincoat, plasters etc.)

, This is optional, but a cute bag will most likely spark others' attention and interest as well as boost your confidence. Use fabric markers or fabric paint and get your creative side on to make it look more unique or just simply hang a keychain and stick on some pins.

, Wash your face if you took a shower the night before. Brush your teeth and floss/clean out your braces (if you have them).

, Try to choose clothes the night before. The first day of school may be stressful for you so preparing the night before helps. If you are to wear the school uniform remember to iron it and smooth it nicely to prevent creases. Try to look at the mirror before you leave, to make sure your outfit looks okay.

, Try to do hairstyles that will keep your hair out of your face because you are going to be concentrating in school. Clip up your bangs or long fringe. Additionally, you can try pulling back your hair and braiding it for a more classy look. Here are some good back to school hair styles:


Ponytail, French/Dutch/Fishtail/Infinity braid, pig tails, half up-do, side braid or a bun.

, Take your time on the make up because you don't want it to look sloppy. Make sure it is even. All you need is a little foundation, some blush, and a touch of light colored eye shadow. Also, try some lip gloss, but don't wear lip stick. You will look too grown up.

, Try delicious and healthy foods such as waffles, pancakes, yogurt, bagel with cream cheese, or a breakfast burrito that will keep you filled up till lunchtime or recess. That way, you won't starve all day but stay energised and focused during class.

, Also, try to bring mints with you.

, You want to be prepared and totally ready. Double check to make sure everything is in your bag.

, If you're all alone, then don't sit by the window unless you want someone sitting next to you that you don't know. If you are new at your school, then ask someone who looks friendly -- or shy and alone -- whether you can sit next to him or her. Then strike up a conversation, or if you're by yourself, plug in your iPod, iPhone or MP3 player and ignore the crowd. If you're taking public transit, make sure to remember your stops! Keep a log on your phone. If you are late to school, your first day will be ruined!

, Confidence is a likable trait. Having confidence will earn you a lot of friends. It also boosts your popularity.


A good way to become confident is by practicing. A good way to practice is by standing in front of a mirror. Look yourself in the eyes, talk loudly and try to smile as much as you can. If you do this enough, you will start to do it around other people.
Averting your eyes and not looking directly at the person is taken as shy and definitely not confident.

, Smile a little or a lot to your new teachers or new classmates, or especially if you're new to the school, school district. But if you act-up as if you're angry, you may give yourself a bad reputation to be overcoming and undoing for weeks/months, or all year (bringing unnecessary stress on yourself).

, For some, the first day of school may be a pain. Try to make it more enjoyable (or at least bearable) by waking up an hour early and getting 8 to 10 hours of sleep. In the morning, shower (if you didn't the night before.)

, Do the usual class routines.

, Check your TV guide and see when your favorite show is on, have a snack and do your homework so you can watch your show. If it's on pretty soon, have a quick snack, set your recorder to record the show -- then do your homework. After that, call or text your friends and swap first day stories!

Try the backpack out.",How to Pack a Backpack for Your First Day of School," Before purchasing a backpack, you should check your school’s rules to see what type of bags are allowed. A standard backpack or messenger bag should be fine, but many schools do not allow rolling bags. Rolling bags take the stress off your back, but they can be a tripping hazard in school hallways.Call your school if you are not sure what type of backpacks are allowed.;
, There are several shapes and sizes of backpacks to choose from. You can choose a standard backpack, a messenger bag, or a rolling backpack if your school allows it. To decide on a backpack, you should check the material, padding, size, and the straps.For material, you should check the fabric that the backpack is made of. Synthetic materials like nylon and polyester are good because they are fairly water-resistant. Hemp is a good choice if you want a natural material.
If you choose a traditional backpack, check it for padding. It should have foam padding. Pinch the padding to see if it rebounds. It should not pop or crinkle.

, Test out the zippers a few times to make sure they are sturdy, zip smoothly, and don’t catch on fabric. If given the choice, choose zippers over Velcro because Velcro does not last as long. Also check the bag for reflectors, which are helpful if the backpack will be used during the evening and night.

, The backpack should not come up to the shoulders or neck. A good backpack stays in the area of the torso. You should also choose a backpack that will fit into a locker, if a locker will be used.

, The straps should be wide and padded for even weight distribution. Check for waist or chest straps if you are looking for extra support. For a messenger bag, find a bag that can be comfortably worn across the chest for support.

, Think about the amount of supplies you will be putting in your bag. Consider how much space everything will take up, and how much the supplies will weigh. Look inside of the backpack and judge if it will be able to things like a three-ring binder, textbooks, personal supplies, and other classroom essentials. You should also check for zippered and padded compartments.Bring a few supplies you think you will use when testing out a backpack to see if everything will fit. Make sure to not get the new backpack dirty if you haven’t purchased it.
The zippered compartments are good for items like IDs, pencils, and phones. The padded compartments are good for protecting computers.

, Some high quality backpacks may be expensive, but they are usually worth the investment. High quality backpacks last longer. You won’t have to purchase a backpack every year, so the investment pays itself off. Many high quality backpacks have a lifetime guarantee, which means they will be repaired or replaced.Lands’ End, Eastpak, L.L. Bean, JanSport, and REI are a few high quality brands.

, Many schools put out a school supply list every year. Use this as a checklist. If your school does not offer a supply list, write down a checklist of required items. You should have purchased or acquired your items before beginning the packing process. Set all of your items out neatly in the area you will be packing the backpack., The packing process will be easier if you group your items first. Group them according to items that are the same or similar. For example, books go with books, notebooks with notebooks, folders with folders, pens with pens and so on. You can organize by size, color, and/or subject.You should have a folder for every subject and at least two notebooks.

, It is helpful to have cases for pencils, pens, and other small items. Put these items in cases before putting them in the bag. Having separate cases for small items will make packing easier, and keep the items from getting loose in the backpack. , Textbooks are some of the largest, heaviest, and most important items, and they typically take up the most room. Put your textbooks into the main compartment of the backpack first. Put the heavier textbooks towards the back of the backpack to make it easier to carry.If you are in high school, you may not need all of your textbooks every day. If not, put in the textbooks you will need for the first day of school.

, A first day of school may require paperwork. Make sure all paperwork is filled out. Other important papers might include assigned reading lists, a schedule, and a map. Put these items in a folder that will be seen and used, and make sure all paperwork is put in its proper place before packing it into the bag.Place contact info into this folder. This can be an index card with your name, phone number, and address written on it in pen or marker.
For children, it is helpful to have a folder just for paperwork. Label this folder to make remembering and locating it easier.

, These items include notebooks, binders, and any other books you will need for class. Put these items in front of your textbooks in the main compartment. If your bag has two main compartments, put them in the compartment separate from your textbooks.Put in larger items first to avoid crushing smaller items.

, Place any pencil cases with pencils, pens, and erasers into the smaller compartments that may be on the front, sides, or inside of the bag. There may also be a case with art supplies like markers, colored pencils, and crayons to add into a separate compartment., A computer may not be necessary for younger students, but older students might find them necessary. Tablets, however, are often used in schools, whether the students or younger or older. Some backpacks have an extra, padded space in the back for laptops and tablets. If not, put the electronic item in a padded case.A cellphone is good to have for emergencies, but make sure it is turned off for the duration of the school day.
Remember to pack a charger if needed.

, If you are asthmatic, remember to pack an inhaler. For allergies, pack an EpiPen. Pack any other pills or required medication. It is also helpful to add in “just in case” medicine, like Advil for Midol.You may need to send a letter or medication to the school nurse if you have any medical problems.

, Schools usually have water fountains, but it is good to have water available throughout the day. Choose a bottle that is leak-proof and needs to be individually opened and closed. A regular water bottle may leak onto supplies.Avoid juice in boxes or bottles that may leak and stain supplies.

, Younger children will typically have snack time, but having a snack is a good idea for any age. Pack a healthy snack like apples or bananas to renew energy throughout the day. Crackers make good snacks as well. Put the snack in a Ziploc bag, and place it in a side compartment.You might want to pack lunch as well, but lunch boxes or bags may not fit in any already full backpack.

, This might include deodorant, hand sanitizer, a brush or comb, sanitary items for females, hair ties, or lotion. This could also include a cosmetic bag for makeup. Put these items in a small toiletry bag, and place then in a medium-sized pocket separate from important school supplies, in case a liquid item leaks. A cosmetic bag may be separate.Do not bring more than you know you will make use of. Some items like hand sanitizer, deodorant, and feminine items are important to have, but it is probably not necessary to bring all of your makeup.

, Extra clothing is a great idea for very small children that may have accidents or get very dirty during recess. While it may not be necessary for older children and adults, it is a good idea to have an extra set of clothing if taking part in gym class. Put the clothes (pants, shirt, and underwear) in a plastic bag, and put it in any free compartment of the backpack., Older students may have a locker to place their backpack and/or supplies into. A combination lock will be necessary for locker use. Though not necessary, it is comforting to pack a few decorations for a locker. These items might include pictures, art prints, or a charm that you enjoy.Younger children often have cubbies, and it may be comforting to pack a toy to keep in to keep inside of it.

, Once it is packed, make sure the backpack zips up easily without any strain. The backpack will probably be full, but it should not be so full that the fabric looks like it will rip. Walk around with the backpack once it is packed. Your back should not be hurting from the weight of the backpack. Put it in a safe and easy-to-find spot to grab for school.

Select a good study space.,
Arrange your work space so you have all the required items to complete your work.,

Avoid labeling people or making fun of them.,
Be wary of any ""rules"" about style and makeup.",How to Prepare for High School," This will be where you study, do homework and Reading/assignments and complete schoolwork. Whether it is in your bedroom or on a spare table in the living room, anything will do. Working on the kitchen table/bench or any other place that has to be moved frequently probably isn't a good idea. If you don't have a place, ask your parents to get you a desk. High School is the best time to get one.;
, You will need these items and it is highly recommended as it is not only good study wise, but also good for your health.


Grab a table lamp or a desk light and place it on your working bench. This will help the lighting of your workspace.
You might need to hit the stores for this step. Go shopping and pick out some fun stationery for study time only. Try buying the basics - pencils, erasers, pens, white out (if you write in pen), a ruler, a sharpener and a note pad. You might want to grab a stationery holder or something of that sort to hold all your things. Keep your stationery strictly for study and homework time only though, because this could cost a lot.
Buy a plastic drawer. They are only A4 sized (length/width wise) and have a couple of drawers ideal to keep homework and study notes etc in. They are also quite cheap so it won't break your budget.

, These are the years during which you will experience considerable emotional, mental and physical growth. It is important to be prepared for the changes ahead, as well as understanding that the schooling during these years is laying down the foundations for your future, and in many ways, for the remainder of your life. If you choose to make the most of this time, you will gain a great deal out of your high school years. If you choose to hate it and feel that you cannot wait to leave it, you will find it harder. Sure, there may be plenty of reasons to not like high school but one of those reasons should not be because you feel you're too cool for school; being educated is a privilege and a way to improving your life as well as learning how to become a fully engaged citizen. By having the right attitude, you will set yourself up to benefit from the academic side and associated teaching of high school, in spite of any negative social aspects of these years.

, Thinking negatively isn't always going to do you any good, or the people around you. Make it count. You will remember high school when you are older, and you don't want to tell your children embarrassing stories you'll regret once you are grown up.

, Sometimes, this isn't easy. If you want to do well, you will have to learn that you are not always right in life. You are not always doing the correct thing, and that you are not the best at everything. When it comes to this time in their life, a lot of teenagers refuse to listen to the truth because their mind is set on impressing others, and they let their attitude get the better of them. This isn't helpful to you though, because you can't improve if you won't listen to constructive advice; advice is good. Even if you think that it's rude, it's actually quite flattering if someone cares enough to help you; try to look at it that way instead of feeling affronted or insulted. Think positive thoughts and you could be on the run home happily!

, Do not simply ""think"" you are capable; you need to work hard at it and hone your talents and skills though practice, repetition and dedication. Success doesn't drop on your doorstep through sheer willing it; put in the effort, recognize what your strengths are and apply yourself and you will start to increase your competence at whatever it is you've set your heart on.

, Try to arrange a time for you to call when they aren't busy or doing homework, so you aren't disturbing their plans. Catch up for no longer than 30 minutes though, because you could rack up major phone bills your parents won't be happy for!

, Recess and lunch is the perfect time to talk. Eat and chat together and say all you missed out on saying during lesson time.

, This is the perfect opportunity to laugh, have fun and to just chillax. You can also form a study group just before the sleepover, using the sleepover as a reward for the hard study!

, It's also best to make a friend who's in the same form as you then you can talk in the morning and at lunchtimes.

, Just tell them you will always be there for them as they will probably be going through some major changes as well as you. They might have a boyfriend/girlfriend.

, Popularity might seem nice but it is not necessary. In fact, popularity is often not nice, as it entails responsibilities to maintain certain appearances, hang around certain people and always feel on show. That is certainly not for everyone and it can hamper getting on with what matters to you if you can't manage it well. Moreover, being popular doesn't equate with getting ahead later in life; high school popularity won't get you into college, the corner office or entrepreneurship. Sure, it's great to have lots of friends but always be realistic about the depth over the breadth of those you count as good and dependable friends.


Maintaining popularity can often mean doing things that detract from what you really want to be doing, or can even be things that are bad for you and your reputation. If you're doing drugs, having sex, stealing designer clothing, etc., all because you feel pressured by popularity, that's going to ruin your reputation and give you a really rocky and even dangerous start to the rest of your life.
If you have to change things about yourself to be popular, then you're not being authentic. Eventually this will hurt you as you fail to develop the parts of yourself that you really care about. For example, if you're naturally quiet and reserved, forcing yourself to be outgoing and constantly socializing will exhaust you and leave you feeling irritable and always distracted. Moreover, other people will notice that you're trying too hard and may lose respect when you fail to keep delivering.
Popularity is often viewed as a contest, to see who is ""top dog"". While such competitiveness can initially feel entertaining, it's a massive drain on your energy and a major diversion from why you are at high school, which is to learn and succeed academically. Shift your competitive energies to the studies!

, Instead, make friends who are good for you and who are true to you.

, Hurting people's feelings is not a way to be popular; it's a way to get a sour reputation and to end up alienating people. Nobody is perfect, and everybody has weaknesses. Pointing these out and failing to be supportive is a sign of insecurity and inability to tackle one's own weaknesses, and isn't a very nice way to live.


People who are constant targets of negative criticism can develop a lot of self-hate. Don't be responsible for inducing that in others. Step into someone else's shoes for a while and realize how harmful insults, barbs and teasing can be.
Be kind to the popular people, even if they don't like you back and you don't much like them.
Try not to be the constant critic. It's not cool, and it's often cruel. Criticizing others for the sake of making them ""better people"" is not good advice; it's simply imposing your preferences onto other people, so that you don't have to make changes. In fact, people who do this frequently criticize will continue to do so throughout life, never resolving the underlying insecurities, because it turns into a crutch. Be helpful and constructive rather than negative and demeaning. Ask yourself: ""Is this really advice I am sharing or just me being difficult because I don't like what this person is doing or stands for?"".

, Makeup is a way of presenting ourselves to the world; for millennia both men and women have used it as a way to style themselves, get noticed and to either set themselves apart from others or to show conformity to a particular group. That doesn't make it compulsory. It doesn't matter whether or not you wear makeup; you're not at school to prove that your appearance rates. You're at school to learn.


If it matters to you enough, wear a little makeup but don't see others who do not wear it as any less; it's all a choice and it really is a choice each wearer should think about carefully and not just to fit in with what's ""expected"".
As for fashion, wear what you can afford, is comfortable and looks good on you. Brand label obsessiveness and high level spending feeds the coffers of the corporations that manufacture the clothing, and does little for improving your sense of well-being and self-efficacy. Make choices that benefit you.

Be well prepared.,
Concentrate on good presentation.,
Aim to be confident, even if you're feeling nervous.,
Remind yourself that you'll soon be very familiar with the school, perhaps within a week.,
Act your natural self.,
Introduce yourself to other people.,
Speak clearly.,
Know what to say ahead of meeting people.,
Take your time to make good friends.,
Talk to your teacher about your shyness if it impacts your classwork or interactions within class.",How to Not to Be Shy at a New School," Remove any worries that you might have about the first day by being ready for the day. Have all of the books and stationery organized the week before, know your classrooms and the school layout (visit the week before if possible) and have all of your clothes washed and ready for the week ahead. By being well prepared, you can help yourself to feel in control of the things you can be in control of, and this can reduce feelings of anxiety.
, Iron your clothes, match them well and have clean and tidy shoes. Groom yourself nicely, to have neat hair and a clean face. When you present yourself neatly, people make good assumptions and it gives you a boost of confidence.

, Think about the good things ahead, such as making new friends, getting assigned new subjects and learning amazing new things. There will also be clubs, after-school activities, sports and school team activities for you to become a part of, allowing you to meet new people who might turn into new friends.


It's okay to feel nervous. This is normal and it's something that every person experiences when doing something new. Try to balance the nerves with some excitement about what is ahead for you in the new school session.
Breathe deeply and slowly to help control any butterflies you experience at school during those first days.

, It doesn't take long to get to know where everything is and to learn your new timetable. It may seem like a big deal to begin with but it can help to visualize the following week and weeks after, when you'll be very familiar with all of the places and it'll feel like a normal routine. Visualizing this can help you to feel more comfortable about the beginning., Try to stay relaxed and comfortable. The first days at a new school are about being observant, neutral and respectful. Be friendly to everyone, just saying hello and smiling kindly a lot. Nobody knows you yet, so it's fine for you to avoid lengthy or in-depth conversations and just stick to the standard pleasantries of introducing yourself and saying hello.

, Don't wait for others to do this first. Many other people are shy too, and even if you feel really shy, it's a gesture of respect and kindness to reach out and just say hello. Remember that you're not being asked to give a speech or even have a long conversation, just to say hello for now, and to tell people who you are.


Don't be afraid to mention that you feel shy if the time feels right. Other people may have the same feelings as you, and many people may be understanding. You could say something like: ""I am a little nervous about starting at a new school and I feel a bit shy. I don't mean to be this quiet but it's a lot for me to take in. I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and the routine soon.""

, Look at the person in the eye when speaking. If you avoid eye contact, you can make the other person feel uncomfortable. By speaking clearly and being willing to make eye contact, then you give yourself a good chance of being listened to and of making some connections with others.


Don't wait for people to come to you. Instead, go up to them and ask if you can join in. If you wait, chances are that many people will get set firmly in their group early on and won't approach you.







, Half the battle with shyness is worrying about what to say to other people. This can be dealt with even before you go back to school by thinking about what things to talk to others about and coming up with a quick rundown of who you are and what things you like to do. Other things to consider when you talk to others include:

Ask what their favorite band is. Discuss a movie or the weather. All that basic stuff.






Use humor. Are you funny? The best way to win others over is either to make them laugh, or be nice.






Make sure to laugh at other people's jokes, it helps them to feel appreciated and helps you each to feel comfortable.







, Getting to know others slowly is a good way of ensuring that the people you think might become new friends are definitely people you'll be comfortable around. Remember that everyone is like you, wanting to make friends.

, Your teacher will be able to suggest some activities and techniques to help you to feel more comfortable and at ease."

Getting Back in the Routine.,
Shopping.,
Your Backpack.,
The Night Before.,
The Morning Before School.,
The Actual Day.,
Your Locker.,
New And Old.,
Congratulations!",How to Organize the First Day of School," At least two weeks before the first day of school, start going to bed and waking up at set times earlier. Start showering regularly. Set up an exercise routine for 3-4 days out of the week. Start washing your face every day.;
, About a week and a half before the first day of school, go shopping. Get school supplies. That means: backpack, pencils, pens, notebooks, highlighters, folders, erasers, binders, a calculator, a planner, a pencil case, and a lunch box. I would suggest having a different binder for every class. Shop for things to go in your locker. You could use magnets, a small mirror, and maybe a container for extra pens and pencils. Collect the things you will need for lunch, such as lunch meat, bread, fruit veggies, water bottles, and ice pack(s).

, Put one notebook and one folder in each binder. Then, in the largest part of your book-bag, put the binders with the spine facing the hand you write with. Then, put the pencils, erasers, highlighters, and calculator in the pencil case. Place that in front of the binders furthest from the strap.

, First, you need to make lunch. If you are packing one, pack a healthy one with one food from each food group. Put it in the refrigerator where it is easy to get to. Take a shower. Wash all body parts, including your hair. Remove any unwanted hair. Change into some comfortable pajamas. Check the weather for the next day. Then, pick your outfit according to that. That means if it's supposed to be warmer, pick shorts. Lay your outfit where it won't wrinkle and where you can get to it easily. Go to bed and get a good night's sleep.

, Wake up at least an hour before school begins. Put on some cheerful music! Chances are, it'll cheer you up. Dress your self. Run to the kitchen and grab yourself a bite to eat. Cereal will do just fine here, but if you prefer another breakfast, that's okay, too. When breakfast is done, brush through your hair and style it as you prefer. Brush your teeth and apply makeup as you wish. Put on deodorant and perfume. Put on socks, shoes, and jacket. Grab your backpack from wherever you left it and your lunch from the fridge. You're ready to take on the school day,

, You will probably be a little confused, and that's okay. Find your home room and locker. If you need help, ask a nearby teacher. Don't be embarrassed. They are standing there for a reason!

, Put your binders on the shelf and your books on the bottom with your pencil case next to it. Hang your magnets and mirror on the inside if the door. Place the extra writing utensil container where you wish. Hang up your jacket and backpack and place your lunchbox where you wish.

, Say hello to your friends from last year. You're probably dying to see one another! If you have your friends around, you won't feel as nervous. You also should become familiar with the new surroundings. If you have time, take a walk around the new hallways.

, You have successfully organized your first day of school.

Double-check you've remembered everything.",How to Pack Your Backpack for the First Day of Freshmen Year," Ideally, you'll want this backpack to last you all four years, so investing in a good one is a smart decision. Expect to spend upwards of $50 for a good backpack.;
, There are many different types of backpacks that offer advantages and disadvantages in style and utility. Try out a few in a store and see which feels best to wear and access.



Top-loaded bags come in either zipper or strap closure: the former offers more security; the latter usually offers a bit more room for items.

Messenger bags are popular and stylish with a single strap. The disadvantages are that they become bulky and awkward to wear when they're full and that the weight is unevenly distributed on your shoulders, which is not good for your back.

Wheeled bags are great for transporting heavy books; however, even when empty, they are heavier than other bags because of their wheels, so make sure you're able to lift it without straining your back. Forewarning: a wheeled backpack will not fit in your locker, and some schools do not allow wheeled backpacks, so check to make sure.

Classic, full-zipper bags offer easy access to your contents and are the most versatile for school use.

, When considering size, think not only about how many school books you're willing to carry on your back, but also about the size of your body: if it's too big/small it won't fit correctly.


Most backpack companies provide an online size chart, but you should try on several backpacks to see what size fits your unique body.
It's not advisable to carry more than 15% of your body weight on your back, so keep this in mind when looking at backpack sizes and imagining how much you'll be packing.

, How many compartments you use depends on your style of organization. Consider the following questions when deciding:


What do you intend to pack in your backpack and what do you intend to carry? Big books? Your lunch? A water bottle?
Do you intend to pack your laptop in your backpack? If so, look for bags with a laptop compartment, which usually provides added cushioning.
Do you want built-in compartments for your pens/cellphone/MP3 player/sunglasses?

, Ergonomics has to do with efficient harmony between your body and your work environment, and in terms of backpacks it means back safety. Here are some ergonomic features to consider:


Wide, padded shoulder straps. Relieves strain on your shoulders. Moreover, make sure the straps are adjustable.(Breathable) Back padding. Relieves pressure on your lower back.
Hip padding. Helps balance the backpack and take some pressure off your back by distributing it to your hips.
Chest and/or hip belt. Relieves pressure from your lower back and helps you to stand up straight.

, A backpack's fabric will determine its weight, breathability, and durability. Moreover, some fabrics offer limited style with great weather protection, but others offer style with limited weather protection -- so you may have to compromise.



Synthetic fabrics, such as polyester and nylon, are lightweight and waterproof fabric, so they will hold up best against the elements.

Natural fibers, such as hemp, are more environmentally sustainable, but do not offer much protection against the elements.Leather gains ""character"" as it ages, but is heavier and less flexible.

, Heavy duty, double-headed zippers are the best because they are sturdy and offer easy-access to your contents.

, How your day looks as far as types of classes and extra-curricular activities will dictate what you will need to pack. Ask yourself the following questions:


How many/What kind of classes do you have?
Do you have gym today?
Will you be staying late for a club and/or sports activity after school?

, You have several options when it comes to your paper, and your decision is ultimately personal preference unless your teacher requests one in particular.



Binder. The binder option is good because you can divide it into sections and easily add and remove paper. Moreover, the binder protects the edges of the pages and sometimes even has a built-in folder. The drawbacks of the binder are that it can be bulky and space-consuming, the binder rings sometimes rips through your paper, and it can be awkward to write in if you're left-handed.

Notebooks. The notebook option offers flexibility with 1-, 3-, or 5-subject spiral-bound or composition notebooks, so you have the ability to consolidate your backpack space. At the very least, though, you'll want a separate section/notebook for each class's notes.

Paper type. Whether it's for your binder or your notebook, choose wide-ruled paper -- and, for notebooks, make sure it's perforated so you can cleanly remove the pages if necessary.

, Writing your assignments and other miscellaneous notes in a day planner will relieve you of trying to keep all that miscellaneous information in your head.

, These are easily lost or broken, so pack extra (at least three).


Black or blue ink is the safest investment because some teachers don't allow you to use colored gel pens on tests.

, Crossing-out on tests or in your notebooks will make you look sloppy and disorganized, so having a whiteout handy is convenient.


Look for a roll-out whiteout, as liquid whiteout can get messy and takes time to dry.

, Mechanical and wooden pencils each have their advantages and disadvantages, so consider the following:


A mechanical pencil does not require sharpening, but you have to carry around lead refills.
A mechanical pencil sometimes ""jams,"" and the last bit of lead is difficult to use because it tends to slip out of the shaft.
A wooden pencil requires sharpening (sometimes frequently), so you'll need to carry a sharpener or use your classroom's electrical sharpener.
A wooden pencil is more difficult to keep sharp because the tip tends to break off with pressure.
Regardless of which type of pencil you choose, purchase a separate eraser that erases cleanly because the erasers on most pencils tend to get streaky.

, One folder might be enough, but more may help you stay better organized between your different classes.

, Few classes hit the ground running, but you don't want to be unprepared, so, if you own one, bring your calculator just in case. If you don't own a calculator, ask your Math teacher after class which calculator he/she recommends.


If you do purchase a calculator, make sure it is a graphing calculator.

, Your binder, folders, notebooks, and whatever textbooks you have should go against your back in your bag's main compartment.

, Your day planner and your pen and pencil case (if applicable) should go toward the outside of your bag.


If you have other compartments, sometimes there are places especially designed for these items, so utilize those to save space and to help distribute the weight evenly.Gym clothes could be packed with these items, but it's better to use a separate, drawstring bag because gym clothes will make your bag smell unfavorably.

, These include your lunch, your water bottle, your calculator, and any other items that are liable to be damaged or crushed: these should go on top of the contents of your bag's main compartment or in its own, separate compartment.


Sometimes a backpack has a sleeve for your water bottle.
If your lunch doesn't fit with extra room, it's better to carry it than risk having to eat bruised or smushed food. Alternatively, many schools have cafeterias, so you could always purchase your meal there.
Often a backpack will have a compartment for your cellphone and headphones/earbuds.

, Have you remembered to pack all that you need? Here are a few questions to jog your memory:


Do you need to pack athletic/spare clothes for gym or an extracurricular activity? If so, consider a drawstring bag for these.
Did you pack a big enough lunch if you're staying late at school?
Did you pack your important school papers, such as your class schedule, immunization form, or any miscellaneous permission forms?
Do you want to bring a ball or frisbee for lunch or after school?
What's the weather going to be like? Do you need to bring an umbrella or a rain jacket?
Do you know what time your bus arrives at your stop? Do you have some extra money in case you need to call a cab?

Introduce yourself.,
Ask inventive questions.,
Compliment her, but make sure you mean it.,
Be nice to her!,
Introduce her to your other friends and call her by her name, not as 'the new girl.',
Offer to eat lunch with her or sit next to her in class.,
Give her some advice.,
Ask for her contact details and give her yours.,
Invite her out at the weekend with your friends.,
If she's sitting alone at class, sit with her, but don't use a blank expression when you walk over to her (at least while she's still getting used to things).,
If she comes to you asking a doubt, don't discourage her!",How to Make Friends with the New Girl in Your Class (for Girls)," Something like 'Hi, My name is . What's yours?';
, Remember, she's probably heard 'So what school are you from?' 100 times already. Instead of asking her the same thing, try getting a little more creative and ask things such as, ""What are your favorite sports?"" or, ""What TV shows do you like?"" See if you have anything in common!

, If you compliment her too much, or compliment her on something you aren't sincere about, she'll see right through you, and you may even come across as fake.

, She's probably extremely nervous. The nicer you are, the more comfortable she'll feel around you, and the sooner you can become friends.

,

, Fill her in with what had been going on before she came.

, For example, if she's wearing hooped earrings and the school only allows studs, tell her. Just try not to make it seem like you're singling her out or picking on her. You could phrase it as something like, ""Yeah, I wish I could wear hoops, but the teachers said they were against school rules.""

, You should probably do this after a couple of days, just so you don't come across as too clingy.

, Make her feel like part of your group.

, Smile!

, Instead, try to clear her doubts.

Sleep deprivation can increase your stress and lead to a panic response or bad attitude, both of which can hurt your in-class performance.Insufficient sleep can also interfere with your memory formation and the positive effects of learning.;
, Your brain uses an enormous amount of energy compared to the rest of your body.Lack of energy can contribute to negative feelings, and leave you unprepared to do your best.


Disruptions to a maintained, healthy diet can negatively influence your ability to think.Some brain healthy dietary options are:Blueberries
Avocados
Nuts and seeds
Whole Grains
Beans


Certain foods that disagree with you, no matter how delicious, can make it difficult to focus and create feelings of apprehension.Some examples include:MSG rich foods
Precooked foods
Processed foods
Foods rich in salt
Foods rich in sugar



, Knowing the best way you learn will save you time and energy when preparing for a new class. The three major learning types are auditory, visual, and kinesthetic (hands-on).Visual learners can benefit from watching lectures, concept maps, color coding material, and using flash cards.Auditory learners can assist learning by listening to soft background music, recorded lectures, repeating material aloud, and participating in study groups or discussion.Hands-on learners can aid themselves by taking frequent study breaks, chewing gum while studying, working while standing, and doing demonstrations or fieldwork., A chronotype is a category that classifies the usual sleep time and active period of a person.Try to organize your schedule to suit your chronotype.


Night owls should consider a later class schedule. This will diminish the dread and fatigue you may associate with an early morning class.Larks (early risers), should refrain from staying out late the night before difficult classes. A schedule beginning earlier in the day can improve your performance., Differences between the first and second edition of a textbook can make a big difference when you submit bookwork to be graded. Check with your instructor before you buy any but the recommended version of your class text. Keep in mind supplemental materials, which might include:


Pencils
Erasers
Pens
Highlighters
Ruler
Graph paper
Notebooks
Binders/folders
Planners/calendars

, Anxiety can create stress that leads to difficulty remembering and poor performance.You can spend time in the classroom a difficult subject is held to make it less imposing and improve your ability to concentrate.Organize a study group with your friends in a classroom you feel anxious. This can help ease your nerves.
Perceived stress can have a greater influence on mental state than biology.By perceiving a challenge as manageable, we can limit excessive worry or negative thought cycles., Automatic negative thoughts can create fear or feelings of inadequacy.These are typically a kind of irrational thought, and are not helpful when preparing for school.


Ask questions about your negative feelings and think about how you want to resolve them. This can lead you to a more positive state of mind., Studies have shown that breathing exercises are effective tools for stress management and emotional control.Proper breathing techniques can alleviate dizziness, shortness of breath, and increased heart rate.Pursing your lips can slow your breathing to a more natural rate.Counting as you breathe, making sure to breath in fully and then completely exhale, has also been shown to help with stress and anxiety management., These can sometimes be difficult for you to identify. Something as simple as a caffeinated beverage or energy drink might put you on edge and in a bad mental state.Other triggers can be specific events, scenarios, activities, or people. Ask yourself, ""What might make me feel better in this situation?"" In some cases, apprehension can be lessened by removing caffeine from your diet or asking a friend to tag along.


Some common triggers include:

Coffee
Soda
Caffeinated tea
Tests
Speeches
Physical evaluations
Presentations.



, A laundry list of worries can lead to constant review of negatives that bog you down. Having a plan of attack can limit your unnecessary worry and assist in managing these feelings.Identify problems specific to you and think about how you will respond to them.


Writing out a plan of action can give you clarity and a sense of concreteness.Setting a homework or study schedule can save you from forgetting to turn in assignments.

, Big-picture mentality can help you associate basic principles with more complex concepts.This can be especially helpful with cumulative exams.


Mind maps and diagrams are useful tools for bundling complex or detail-heavy subjects., Even if you can't choose your teacher or schedule, knowing what's in store can help you plan accordingly. Some teachers aren't suited for certain learning styles or personalities. Inquire with friends, upper classmen, and search online to discover whether or not a particular teacher is a good fit for you and, if not, how you might improve the situation.


Make use of habits that engage your learning style. For example, during lectures, hands-on learners can benefit from chewing gum.Talking with instructors the first day of class is a good way of establishing a relationship with them. This can be useful if you have difficulty with the subject down the road.

Make a good first impression.,
Dress in a non-threatening way that is still you.,
Smile!,
Chances are, you and a lot of other new people will be in a place all at once (canteen, field, playground).,
Try to forge good relationships with people in your classes, as these are the people you are forced to be around.,
If someone is giving off friendly vibes, compliment their look, clothes or bag.,
Get involved in things.,
Be yourself.,
Be different and unique, but don't deliberately try to stand out from everyone else so much that everyone can see you're trying too hard.",How to Make Friends on the First Day of School," People don't usually mean to judge you, but they will do it subconsciously anyway. Make sure you are at least clean for your first day, because fresh breath is really important, too. Chewing gum all the time makes you look like a cow-chewing cud.;
, You may have to tone yourself down a bit before you feel acceptable, but don't erase your personality completely from your look. If you usually were sweats and a t-shirt, try to dress yourself up a little, but if you usually wear dresses, dress it down.

, Possibly, you won't feel like it. In fact, very few people will; but if you do, people will assume you are confident and friendly, and therefore, they will be drawn to you. Smile and you'll be a people-cobweb. Just remember - a real smile comes from the eyes.

, A good way to make contact with someone is to ask them if you can sit in the seat near them. This is especially effective if you are alone.

, If you've got a spare pencil and someone needs one, lend it to them. Ask them questions: ""How was your weekend?"", ""What class have you got next?"" and so on, are standard questions that will create at least a small conversation. Respond with a friendly attitude instead of a haughty or bored one.

, You have a better chance of becoming friends if you do.

, Extra curricular activities are a great way to bond with others and make new friends, while playing a sport or developing a skill.

, Don't do anything that you don't feel comfortable with, including taking up smoking, following celebrity culture or wearing the latest fashions. Don't go with peer pressure: dress however you want, but don't expect others to do the same.

, Wear different clothes or do different sports or have an unusual hobby, but don't rub it in everyone's face or they'll just think you're showing-off. Be simple and yourself. If you do make friends, people will like you later on into the friendship for who you are.

Go to sporting events.,

Figure out what kind of music they’re into.,

Take note of their fashion.,

Small talk in the hall way.,

Sit with them at lunch.,

Offer to have everyone over.,

Show them your sense of humor.,

Embrace differences.,

Keep putting yourself out there.,

Continue getting to know them.,

Make consistent plans.,

Let them know they’re important.",How to Fit in With the Cool Kids," Even if you’re not athletically gifted, you can find friends through athletics. Sitting front row at your school’s big games not only puts you around other cool kids, but it also gives you common ground. It gives you things to talk about the next day at school.

If you are athletically gifted—try out for the team. You’ll forge close friendships with other athletes. These friendships will help you form essential mental, physical, and emotional building blocks to help you become friends with the cool kids.;
, Music is a great way to start a conversation. Asking what music they like it the easiest way to find out. Simply start by asking if they’ve heard a new song or if they’ve attended a local concert recently., Fitting in with the cool kids is much easier to do if you look similar to them. Mirroring some staple clothing pieces will also give you something to talk about. Shopping for similar clothes means you will likely be shopping at the same stores and that will give you common ground., The more you talk to the cool kids, the more you’ll learn about them. You don’t need to be at a big party to talk—you can do it in the hallway between classes. Even if they’re with a group, walk with them and chime in. If you see a couple of cool kids by themselves, go up and small talk to learn some basic interests.

Ask if they’ve heard about the theme for homecoming.
Tell them about your weekend.
Bring up a class you have in common.

, Lunch is a very important time for socializing in school. It’s one of the few times of the day you actually have time to chat about absolutely anything for more than a moment or two. Don’t overthink it—simply walk up and ask if you can sit with them. They’ll probably control the conversation but tune in when you can.If nothing else—you can talk about the food. Cafeteria food is always an open ended conversation.

, Put together a hangout to get everyone together. It can be a study party for a big test, an evening hangout, or a spot to prepare for the game or dance that weekend. Make sure you ask your parents before you invite a lot of people to your house., The cool kids, as most people you’ll encounter in your life, will find it easier to relate to you if you have a sense of humor. When they start asking you questions, answer with some humor. You could also do this by telling them about a good time you had that made you laugh.

Don’t make it inappropriate. Until you have a close relationship with them, this might lead them to be offended., Differences are just as necessary as similarities in new friends. Showing people the way that you think is endearing. Having things in common—like clothing and music taste—is very helpful. However, differences can help bond you together as well. Don’t fake similarities: embrace differences., Going to a couple games or sitting with the cool kids once at lunch won’t help you fit in permanently. You need to continue doing these things if you want to continue fitting in. If you have a loaded schedule, do what you can. Schedule a game or a hangout once a week. It will only take a couple hours out of your schedule and will help you fit in., Never get complacent as a friend. Always try learning more about the cool kids so that you can continue to talk to them on a deeper level. Especially if you don’t seem to get along with someone at first, continue to get to know them better. Often, people take a while to warm up. This may be the case, so just continue getting to know them and your opinion could change., Now that you’ve put yourself out there and hung out with the cool kids, you should make some consistent plans to keep hanging out. Have everyone over on the first Friday of every month for pizza and a movie or plan to have them over after each home football game., People want to feel wanted. It’s human nature. If you like spending time with them, tell them. You don’t have to remind them daily about it, but make a point to show them that your friendship means something.A great time to do this is around a holiday. Writing them all personalized cards to go with some goodie bags for Valentine’s Day, Halloween, or New Years is cheap and easy.

Practice good hygiene and grooming.,
Dress as your best self.,
Master your posture and body language.,
Don’t fidget.,
Smile.",How to Impress a Classmate1," Among a mass of adolescent and teenage students, being clean and well groomed can really make you stand out. When puberty starts causing more body odor, you can impress your classmates by taking good care of yourself. Shower and wash daily. Use deodorant and even consider cologne or perfume, but be sure not to overpower or it will have the opposite effect. Brush your teeth daily. Wear clean clothes and keep your hair neat. Your classmates will notice if you are always hygienic., Dressing well will set you apart from many of your classmates, and you can do it without a suit and expensive clothing. Part of dressing well means finding the style that matches your personality and body type best. You don’t have to wear business attire to look good, but you probably won’t impress anyone wearing sweats either. Try your best to always wear clean clothes that are free of stains. Wear clothes of the appropriate size. Ultimately, you do want to be comfortable because it will show if your clothes are bothering you.People often judge by how others are dressed no matter what, so it is likely your attire is something people will notice. Using that to your advantage to make a statement will help get you noticed in the right way.
You can express your personality through what you wear. For example, you might wear apparel depicting a sports team or band that you like. If you are outgoing and a little crazy, you can wear clothes with a lot of bold colors. If you are more conservative, you can express this by wearing dress pants and a button shirt.

, People notice how you carry your body, so learning to maintain straight posture will show people your confidence. Since you spend much of your time with classmates in class, you will be sitting a lot. Learn to sit up straight and to not slouch down in your chair. Don’t cross your arms because it tends to express negative emotions.Keeping your head up and faced forward shows that you are attentive to what the teacher is saying. Nodding is also a good way to show you are listening.
Consider keeping your legs firmly planted in a fairly wide position, rather than close together or with your legs crossed. This is seen as a more powerful position.
When talking with a classmate, eye contact is a great way to show that you are engaged with what they are saying. Avoiding eye contact is usually seen as a way of trying to hide something.

, This applies to sitting in class but also times when you are standing around with friends. Fidgeting tends to be a sign of stress, nervousness, or an overall lack of confidence, so when people see you doing it, they will notice you in a negative way. Fidgeting can include shifting in your seat a lot, tapping your pencil on the desk, or moving a lot when you talk. None of these things are necessarily bad, but they give an appearance of you not being at ease which can turn people off.If you tend to be constantly moving, you will need to actively tell yourself to calm your body down. This will take work, but once you are conscious of it, you can master it.

, This is such a simple thing, but it works wonders for your overall appearance. Smiling makes you seem more confident, gives the look of being positive, and makes you seem friendly, all of which are things you want your classmate to see if they are going to be impressed with you. Even so, you don’t want to go around smiling all the time as this will most likely put people off. Just be willing to flash a smile on occasion, especially toward the person you want to impress."
"
Be friendly.,
Be good at something.,
Be confident in trying new things.,
Keep cool under pressure.,
Ask your classmate about his or her interests.,
Give a compliment.",How to Impress a Classmate2," School can be a place where meanness and hostility grow, and many students forget the rules of treating each other well. Make a specific effort to be someone who counteracts this. Always speak kindly to people in the class by not criticizing their wrong answers or making fun when they struggle. The person you want to impress will take notice that you are someone who everyone sees as kind and good to be around.There are lots of ways to be more friendly. Go out of your way to be nice to students that usually are overlooked or bullied. Ask people how they are doing and really mean it and listen to their answers. Show an interest in your classmates’ lives outside of school.

, Your classmates will take notice if you are really great at something. Within the limits of school, you have the basic options of academic success, sports, and the arts, but don’t be afraid to find something outside of school to excel at. You shouldn’t get good at something for the sole purpose of impressing people, but it can be a good addition to making you well-rounded as a person.You may not have a lot of opportunities to show the talent you have, but if something like a talent show does come up, have the confidence to go for it.
It’s also a good option to invite the classmate to participate in the activity with you so you can show them the skills you have.

, If you want to be noticed, go out of your way to try things that everyone else seems to be afraid of doing. A great way to do this is to volunteer in class when the other students are sitting back not wanting to be picked. Your classmate will see that you are confident and will be impressed by your initiative., School can often be a time of stress, tension, and drama in aspects of school work, fighting among students, and times of performance like giving a speech. When the others around you are giving in to all the pressure, you can maintain a balanced composure and stay cool. Be someone who can handle whatever situations come your way. Your classmate will be impressed and will look to you as someone to rely on when things get rough.A great way to stay composed in any situation is to take deep breaths and focus your attention on your breathing. When you start to feel stressed, your body's natural response is to speed up your breathing, but this often makes it harder to stay calm. Take breaths more slowly than you normally would.
It can also help you stay calm to pause for 5-10 seconds before responding or reacting. Losing your cool tends to happen in an instant, but if you practice waiting for a little while before doing anything, you will have time to think first.

, It’s fairly common among students, and even adults, to want to talk a lot about themselves and tell all about their lives. You can make an impression on someone by showing true interest in what they like and think about. Go out of your way to notice some of their interests and then learn about those for yourself. Your classmate will be impressed that you cared to let them share with you and that you took an interest in them.If you take the time to get into the interest they told you about, you can go back to the person and tell them about your experience. If they mention a band, go listen to their albums and tell them what you liked about it. Or watch the person’s favorite movie and go repeat a line from it to him or her.

, With so many people bragging about themselves and wanting everyone to notice them, you can stand out by giving a compliment. If your classmate wears an outfit you like, tell them how great they look. If they do well on a project or big assignment, congratulate them. If you know they played well in a sport over the weekend, tell them nice job. You can do this consistently over time, but not so often that it becomes obvious you are doing it."
"
Let your crush know that you are interested.,
Share something personal with a potential friend.,
Offer help rather than criticism.",How to Impress a Classmate3," Much of romance in school is done in secret because you are often afraid to be embarrassed if you get rejected. One way to impress someone you are romantically interested in is to be honest with them and let them know you notice them. Tell them you are interested in getting to know them more. This can be a bold move, and may not always work out, but rather than trying to get someone’s attention indirectly, you can come right out with it.In many cases, your crush will be impressed that you had the confidence to tell them how you felt, and if they like you in return, you’ll save time and energy you would have used trying to get their attention. If they did not yet like you in return, this move might be enough to win their affection.
If you have a crush on someone that you don't actually know yet, it is probably best to introduce yourself first and wait to tell them about your crush. Give yourself a chance to talk to them a few times before revealing why you wanted to meet them.

, There are always classmates who you want to be friends with but you only ever see them in class. One way to make an impression and move toward friendship is to reveal something personal about yourself to the person. This is probably best done gradually because you don’t want them telling the whole school your deepest secret. Make a real effort to talk to the person once a day for a week or so and then tell them something beyond what they would know from class.You want to find a good balance between too surface level, such as what food you like, and the most personal thing you can think of, such as family problems you have never told someone. Tell them about a hobby you have outside of school that most people wouldn’t guess. Or tell them about a goal you want to achieve later in life.
A good way to try and make space for this conversation is to start sitting with the person at lunch or riding the bus together or simply walking between classes together whenever you can. This will give you a little extra time to talk to the person and get to know each other more.
Once you have gotten past the initial step of making a first impression, you can work to build a stronger friendship.

, Being smart in school can be tricky because people may perceive you as being arrogant or a know-it-all, which is rarely a likeable quality. One way that you can impress a classmate with your smarts is to stop correcting people openly during class, but instead ask them privately if they could use some help. There are always students who struggle in school, and if you are really good in a subject, they could probably benefit from your help. Bullying people in class who make mistakes makes an impression, but not in a good way.If you notice someone struggling in class, go to them afterwards and say, “I noticed you were having a hard time with the question you were asked. Would you ever want some help studying?” The person may still turn you down, but you will come across as more respectful than if you call him or her out during class.

, Carnivals are difficult to organize on your own.  You will need to form a council or party planning committee to help with the ideas and setup for your school carnival. Invite people to join the council and offer the more motivated persons enticing roles with plenty of room for people to innovate and use their initiative.

An animal theme: Have a petting zoo, base games and tables on animal themes, have the children wear animal costumes, etc.
An art theme: Display the student's artwork everywhere and have an artistic flavor to all of the stalls, games, rides, etc.

, With your council formed, you can begin brainstorming ideas. Do not reject any ideas initially; instead, take all of them on board and use these ideas to generate more ideas. Once you have quite a few on the table, you can then go around the table and get people to select their top 10 ideas. Then reduce it to the top five, and start voting for the best theme.


Make use of online suggestions for carnivals. To help visualize what the carnival could be, set up a screen projection that can beam out internet pages to the council as they're seated around the table. Then do image searches for such topics as ""carnivals"", ""bazaars"", ""fetes"", ""school fairs"", etc. and see what is returned. The many images that return for your different searches will help to inspire the brainstorming tremendously.

, Be aware of the backgrounds of the students and seek to choose a theme that is culturally acceptable that ensures the carnival is inclusive. If the carnival takes place during the holiday season, you may want to do a Christmas theme or a broader holiday theme that can also account for Hannukah, Kwanzaa, etc.


Seasonal carnivals can remove the focus on any single cultural or religious theme to the festival. For example, if the carnival takes place during the spring season, you may want to do an outdoor theme that involves sports and games.

, As these can increase cost and impact on people's time and resources, they are an important determining factor for the theme.


For example, if the council wants to run a sideshow theme but it's clear that hiring the rides will be too costly, you can either decide to focus only on games that can be set up using school property, or you might even change the theme altogether, to one that has lower cost implications.

, Research on the hours of your carnival site, as well as the activities that your site offers. Make sure that allows for date and time reservations, as well as the purchasing of tickets (either online or at the doors).

, Carnivals cost money and time.  Form a budget with the money you have earned for this event.  You will need to find stores that can sell you decorations and rent you carnival equipment.  These can be found locally anywhere in your town.  


Have some helpers, who can take inventory of everything you purchased and keep track of all equipment used.

, You must have a date set for your carnival.  Be sure to get the word out.  Send the students home with flyers and invitations, and make sure that the community knows about the theme, as well as the benefit of your cause.


Decide on the time that your carnival starts, as well as the time that it is over. Try to pick the least busy time possible.

, Be sure that you have a list of everything in your budget.  Purchase all your decorations a few days before the carnival.  If there is any rented equipment, you will need to schedule this a few weeks prior to the actual carnival event.

, Now that you have all your supplies and equipment, it is time to set it up.  Have your group set up everything before the guests arrive.  You should be able to set everything up within 6-7 hours if everything was prepared properly.  Be sure to know where everything is to be placed prior to setting up.

Walk in peacefully.,
Smile.,
Now is the time you make your move.,
If you need to go to the bathroom.,
When it's time for lunch sit at a table that you think you might feel comfortable.,
Continue on with a normal day.,
When it's the end of the day and it's time for school dismissal, be proud of yourself that you've gotten through the first day and made friends.",How to Make a Lot of Friends on the First Day of School," Nobody likes freaks that barge in and scare them and knock all their stuff down. This move will help your first impression on the people you spot and want to make friends with. Don't make your walk too dramatic though, people find that kind of creepy.;
, Not too much but just right to make your day more pleasant and maybe a special somebody might just find your smile very attractive. Smiling also helps acne go away (if you have acne). It makes you look like a happy, clean and friendly person. Remember, nobody likes a dirty, lazy, or grumpy person.

, Go up to a person or a group and start talking. Say hi first then start. Make sure your breath smells good. Chew some gum (make sure you get rid of it before you approach them), anything that makes your breath smell better. Don't use breath spray though. It makes it smell even worse. When you talk, make the conversation about evenly balanced-talk about you and them. You want to find out lots about them so you know if they are your type of friends. Be careful what you talk about, and don't lie. If you do it'll come back to you. If they don't find you interesting just move on. There's a lot more people in the school that want to be your friend than them.

, Use it, and if you need to, fix your hair, put on more make up (if you're a girl) whatever you think will make you look better do it. Just don't spend more than your time limit in the bathroom. You'll miss out on the first few minutes of first period and teachers DO NOT like this.

, Maybe you're goth, popular(if you think so),a nerd (no offense), or your old friends from last year (if you have some) or wherever you think you'll fit in.Just sit down at a table. Chances are that those people you sit with will be your first friends for the year.

, Just follow your schedule and you'll be fine. Whenever you're between breaks and you feel like there's a chance of making more friends or a friend, then talk to him/her/them. It's okay to be shy. Everybody feels like that on the first day. Just try to calm yourself down and hopefully it'll work.

, Even if it's just one friend you made it's better than nothing. Maybe he/she will become your new best friend.

Stride with confidence.",How to Become Your School's 'It' Girl," People like girls that have their own thing. Remember in order to be an it-girl you have to be different and special. Little things, whether its brightening up your pink phone with Swarovski crystals, customizing your bag with felt tips or your kickers with playboy shoelaces, will make you that bit original.


Remember: Don't try too hard. Make it look like it comes naturally.;
, Show everyone that your interested in learning new things; people that never want to do anything are boring! It could be anything, like singing or writing your own songs to cheerleading or art, just as long as you show your true potential people will respect you because you're good at something. Just don't be big headed about it or show off. It's good to always do at least one of the arts and play at least one sport, even if you didn't have to actually try out for the team. Hiking in your local park can be good too.

, No one wants to be seen with a slacker. You want to be seen as someone exiting, but you have to show everyone that you\re serious and care about your education. Try to get all A's and B's.Don't freak out if you get a C, just study more often. When it comes to learning, bunking off or smoking in the toilets is not a good idea. If you take life as a joke people won't take you seriously and will mess around with you.

, Maybe it's getting to know the teachers, or being in the paper staff. Whatever it takes, always know what's going on in school. Also, always be ready to lend a helping hand. It boosts your school reputation.

, This is the most important. Being an it girl is not just about being popular and pretty, it's also about respecting yourself and others around you, and having good values in life. If you're fake or mean, everyone will hate you. Smile and laugh a lot (but not obnoxiously) Never make someone feel down or talk to them like you're better than them. Treat everyone as an equal; when something looks good on someone, tell them! Don't over-compliment them, as this might make you look like a bad friend.

, Okay, confession time. You love to crack jokes, don't you? Humor is a good boost of confidence, but too much will make it seem awkward - find an ending point.

, Just anyone. Even if it's ""What homework do we have in algebra?"" It's an excuse to talk to people. Make them laugh, but don't try to be funny. Talk about things you can relate to, be really friendly and always smile, be tight with people; just don't be too open with your secrets, personal things are called personal for a reason and you could really damage your reputation if you let people gossip behind your back. Just know who your real friends are.

, Ask the cool girl you sit next to in science if she wants to go bowling this weekend and frequently throw sleepovers. If you invite people to do things, they will have to invite you to do things.

, Sure, this worked in Mean Girls, so why wouldn't it work in real life? This is because things like this only happen in movies, not real life. Think: would YOU like to be known as the girl that is rude to everybody? Neither would we., Brush your hair everyday. Always shower at least every two days (or every day if you are very active), brush your teeth for at least 2 minutes every morning and before bed.

, Being healthy isn't just something you need to do to get in with the popular crowd - it's something important altogether.e it's having a good workout every day. Just remember to be active for 60 minutes every day!

, Having good skin helps. If you have breakouts often, you can have masks, etc. Research what facials and other supplies you will need to use. Also, use concealer, or foundation. Have good hygiene. No one wants to be talking to someone and only smelling their horrible stench because they haven't showered in a week.

, If it doesn't, then don't wear make-up. It's as simple as that, so don't let anyone tell you what you should or shouldn't do.


Wear primer to make foundation easier to spread.
Put foundation to hide dark spots, and concealer for imperfections, blemishes, etc.
A little base (powder) is helpful to make you look natural.
Also, having your nails done is good too. Always clean your nails. If you go to the salon, and can't think of a good color, get a french manicure. It looks good with every outfit, and stays long.

, Walk down the halls with confidence. Remember to flip your hair, smile, and wave. It'll make everyone stop and stare in awe. Walk slowly enough that people can watch you, but not so slow as to make it look like you don't know where you're going. Act like the halls were made for you to walk in.


Be yourself! Self-confidence is the most important part of becoming the ""it"" girl of your school.

,
Have as many plans as possible to over throw the other crowd.,
Popularity always comes to one thing.",How to Conquer the Popular Group at School," If you're not sure to how many people should be in it take a look at the other group. Try to match your numbers with theirs, have a few extra people if possible. The bigger your troops the better, but make sure not to make it too big.;
, It's not fair to drag them into a war without them willing to be soldiers.

, Be fashionable but don't copy any of the celebrities or the leader of the other group. You need to stand out, wear bold colours, be brave and don't be afraid to make a fashion statement.

, Remember always to be nice while giving them tips. No one likes a mean army leader. Take your troops out shopping and invest in a few new accessories. Popular girls are stylish and wear different outfits most of the time. This doesn't mean you have to buy new clothes every day, just try another combination of the things you have in your wardrobe.

, If you don't know how to use it there are always make-up tutorials on you tube which can be helpful if you're trying for a unique look. Don't go hard on the make-up, keep it as natural as possible. That way you will win the schools affections faster and rise on the popularity ladder. Try out different shades of lip gloss , lipstick , eye shadow or eye liner before you make up your mind.

, It has to be washed and shiny, use products that give it more volume. All the people in your troop should have glossy hair, no matter what length. Try visiting the hair salon to see if what hair style matches you the most. Hair can change your whole look, especially if it suits you. The hairdresser should know what suits your face shape. If you don't want to visit the salon you can always look up different style on the internet and try them out.

, You and your soldiers should join as many clubs as possible. That way you will have someone everywhere. That is why you should have different kinds of people. Have sporty people to join the sports clubs and the ones who have other passions the school newspaper, ect. Be nice when you ask your new crowd to join things. If they refuse, don't push them. You should join the planning committee if one exists. That way you will have some say in what is going on.

, Simply ask one of your soldiers to get in there first and save the table for the rest of you. Don't be afraid, sit down and enjoy your lunch. If the other group order you to leave refuse to budge. After all, the table doesn't have their names on it. This will leave the rest of the school in awe and they will grow to admire you.

, If someone asks you help with their homework don't refuse. Being nice is the key to over coming the other popular group, especially if they are mean. Instead of following them the students will turn to you.

, If it's sports or writing articles make sure you shine. Join competition and if anyone from the other group are competing against you make sure to win. But don't cheat. If you do and that comes out into the open you will not look good. People will begin to wander maybe they should turn back to the other group.

, That way you will know if they are planning anything that will harm you. Always be on your guard, after all if a new member joins your group it is always possible they will be spies for the other group. But do not accuse them without any proof, as this will make you look like someone who's paranoid.

, There can always be two popular crowds in a school but always make sure that you're in lead. Be kind to all the students and gain their affection.

, Invite students exclusively to make them feel special. And if that party is amazing everybody won't be able to stop talking about it. Be creative. Musical chairs won't exactly work. Host the party in a house that's big. Or an old barn will always do if you have one at hand. Just make sure it doesn't smell.

, Your grades should always be high, or at least at the same standard that they were before. If you neglect your schoolwork your parents won't be happy. High school isn't everything, there's always college. And if you don't get good grades you'll fail to get into one.

, As a popular person you should be able to keep moving along with the latest tendencies. Don't stick to one thing.

, Doing the same old thing everyday won't get you anywhere.

, Your personality should be bubbly and cheerful, no one wants to see a gloomy face. So smile. And brush your teeth.

, Take a shower everyday, and take care of your skin. Nobody who's popular has a million spots. If you get one here and there you can always use concealer.

, Just a happier version of your old self.

, Upload pictures and make sure you like the pictures of your group members.

, Be ready if it doesn't work out you'll have a hard time. It's a risk you have to take.

,, If you become the captain of the committee or the best player on the basketball team you will have more control. It's all about control. Becoming a school president will always work out in your favour. Or being the teachers favourite. You don't have to be all of those things. Your soldiers can take high positions on teams too.

, Beauty. Even if you think you're not pretty that can always be improved. Exercise to maintain a statuesque figure, eat healthy food and drink water to have clear skin and healthy hair. Change your hair style and wear colours that suit you. Just don't let anyone get the best of you.

Throw a party.","How to Become the ""It Girl"" at a New School"," Don't dress like someone you're not, but maybe be a trendier, prettier, more inviting version of yourself. If you start by looking confident, you'll act confident, and confidence is key to being popular.;
, People judge quickly, especially middle and high school age girls. So try to play it safe, but don't overly suppress your personality. Let it shine through in subtle ways, and don't try to upstage anyone.

, Popular people are friends with everyone, not just the people within their immediate group of friends. It doesn't matter what ""social level"" they're on. People will appreciate you for being so nice. Being popular doesn't mean you're better or above anyone else. It means that you're all around a great person and everyone likes you and would love to hang out.
Be aware: you'll never be left alone for anything if you're friends with everyone.

, So get good grades. Play at least one sport. Be really nice. Set trends. Be outgoing. Throw a rocking party. Play an instrument. Draw or sculpt or take pictures. You don't have to do everything, but be good at a few things, instead of just being amazing at one. *Make sure you don't come across as one of those girls who are perfect and know it. If you are really good at almost everything, be modest.

, Girls honestly respect girls who can get guys, and that will make people want to hang out with you. However, don't flirt with people you don't like just to be popular. Fakers are really universally hated among students. Surround yourself with guy friends from every group. Artists, guys in bands, jocks, shy guys from your class to help you study. Just don't ditch guys and don't go through boyfriends too quickly.

, Don't try to immediately snuggle up to the queen bee. Find a nice, pretty girl that's liked by everyone (kind of like the girl that you want to be) and get close to her. If people see you with her, they'll assume that you're like her, so choose your first friend wisely, because they affect your whole school experience. *Don't become her shadow, be unique!

, Don't be too obnoxious at first. Once you're kind of settled in with a few friends and at least have the attention of some popular people, bring in a 'signature item'. It could be gorgeous dangle earrings, great pumps, bright skinny jeans, vintage tees, belts, cute hats or scarves, anything that's YOU and you think would catch on at your new school. Just make sure you switch it up every couple of months so that people look to you as a fashion icon. Read up on latest trends in magazines like Seventeen, US Weekly, People, Cos-mo, etc.

, Do not use people. Only go out with the guy if you're genuinely into him and want to be in a relationship.

, If you get terrible grades, chances are people might make fun of you for being 'dumb'. If you're irresponsible, for instance drinking too much and taking stupid pictures and videos, really alienates you and makes people think you're not worth it. Be someone that everyone can trust to do the right thing. People will like you for it.

, If you happen to do something that could potentially ruin your rep, handle it coolly. People will laugh with you instead of at you.

, If you joke around with teachers a bit, kids will definitely catch sight of you. Just don't overdo it because nobody wants to be labeled teachers pet. Also, don't talk to much or you'll forever be labeled as annoying.

, If your reputation is really on the fence, the only thing you can do is throw an amazing party. If there's alcohol there, make sure you don't get busted, and that people don't get too wasted AND appoint designated drivers. The important thing, booze or not, is that if people have fun, they'll think 'oh, that girls the one who threw that wicked party. she's fun to hang with'. And you'll be universally hailed as a party queen, which is also a ticket to the top, as long as you don't throw too many, too often, and they're ALWAYS good.

When people notice the confident way you hold yourself, they'll realize you're someone worth being around.Practicing confident habits lowers anxiety and improves social performance, which can make you more outgoing and help those around you feel at ease.;
, First impressions are important, and they tend to stick with people. If you want to be well-liked, your manner of dress should be expressive and make it clear that you take the impression you make on others seriously. Don't worry about following trends or styling yourself in a way you think your peers would approve of; dress to make yourself comfortable, confident and approachable.Investing in your appearance isn't just about having cool clothes. It means adjusting your attitude and behavior to highlight your most attractive qualities.
Get in the habit of bathing and grooming regularly, get plenty of sleep, and make sure you engage in some sort of physical activity.

, This might sound strange, but starting the day off with a solid meal has been shown to wake you up and increase energy levels throughout the day, and can give you that critical brainpower you need to be at your best. Choose whole, healthy foods, like proteins, fruits and whole grains--the energy boost you get from cleaner foods lasts longer and you'll also feel better.


Eating in the morning doesn't have to be complicated: good morning nutrition can be as simple as a bowl of oatmeal, or a muffin with a banana and a glass of milk.
If you're short on time or not accustomed to having breakfast at home, most public schools provide a basic breakfast for students who arrive early enough.

, It might be scary to talk to somebody you don't know, but remember that the other kids are just as new to things as you, or were at one time. Put your best foot forward. Strike up conversation when you can, be friendly and smile at everyone you come across. The more approachable you make yourself, the more people will feel drawn to you, and, with time, the more friends you'll gain., Most people usually end up talking to at least one person when they're in unfamiliar circumstances, and this can provide a great opportunity to make your first friend. Introduce yourself and let them know that you're new. Chances are, they'd be happy to be the one to help you find your way around. Once you've made one friend, you've opened yourself up to meeting many more.

, Immerse yourself with the other students and participate in the same activities. Don't walk the halls with your head lowered or skip lunch because you have no one to sit with; talk to people and get to know them. Show an interest in what's going on around you. Take part in classes like art and PE as these are often cooperative, team-building environments. Before long you'll start to pick up on what people are like and begin make friends that share common interests.

, If you're athletic or have a particular set of interests, research the organizations your new school offers and sign up for something you enjoy. Most schools host a diversity of recreational programs for sports, foreign languages, cinema studies and other special interest groups. Becoming a member of one of these groups can connect you to other students who like the same things you do and make you feel like part of something larger.Participation in extracurricular clubs and programs is also a good way to develop new skills and build valuable relationships and experience that could benefit you later on.

, Find out about school sporting events, dances, and parties and make sure you're there. These are all gatherings where you can come together with your new classmates outside the usual academic confines. If you're the outgoing type, plan your own party or outing as a way to advertise that you're new and interested in getting to know new people.


You can usually find out what's going on in your school through daily announcements and bulletin board postings. Keep an eye out for events that pique your interest, as there will be others with the same interests in attendance.

, Like it or not, the modern age is dominated by the presence of social media, and it's an invaluable tool for forging connections with others. Add your new friends on Facebook or follow them on Instagram. These apps have sections that recommend new friends to you based on people you might know, and they'll also be able to see you and add you as a friend. Seeing other people on your friends' profiles is a good way to spark recognition and prompt an introduction in real life.While social media platforms can be useful tools for making a staying connected to friends, they can also be distracting, time-consuming and used to bully or harass. Treat your friends respectfully, even online, and be sure not to spend so much time using social media that it outweighs your personal life.

, There's no better way to meet new people than through a friend that you like and trust. Think of all the fascinating people out there that you haven't met yet: networking can bring together people who might otherwise have never had contact with one another. What's more, you can also expand your friend group by introducing different groups of friends to each other, creating one big, happy friend group with you as the common thread., Prove to people that you're one-of-a-kind, not just someone ordinary. Now is the time to be daring and exhibit the originality of your character. Everyone has something about them that makes them different; you should show these unique traits off proudly.If you have a special talent or something particularly interesting about yourself, demonstrate it openly. Allow people to see for themselves who you are and what you can do.
Don't conform to norms or try to fit in. Be approachable to draw others to you, then give them a glimpse of something different.
One way to show that you are unique is to present many different aspects of yourself. Don't just cling to one activity or interest. Be smart, be creative, be edgy. Surprise people.

, Spend time hanging out with a lot of different people. People who are truly popular are comfortable being friendly with everyone they come into contact with. Don't just be friends with one group or type of person, but make an effort to get to know everyone. You'll begin bridging gaps in separate groups and become known as a person that brings people together., Once you've become known at your new school, you can start hosting your own events and inviting your friends along. Be active in making plans and getting as many people involved as you can. Find activities that lots of people can do together, such as house parties and group dates. Be sure to invite everyone personally, and give them some face time once they're there.


Taking the initiative to invite people to events you've planned shows that you're interested in being their friend.
If you decide to throw a house party, make sure it doesn't get out of hand. Your guests are your responsibility, so underage drinking and drug use are frowned upon. Keep noise to a moderate level out of respect for your neighbors.
Bowling is a perfect casual outing. You can go in large groups, and it's a fun, relaxed environment to socialize in.

, If you want to be popular, you have to be bold. Place yourself at the center of the action and strive to impress. Be charming and humorous when talking to others. Let everyone see that you're fun to be around—before long, everyone will remember you as a vibrant and exciting personality.

Remember to be confident. When you're at the center of attention, it's important that you be cool and collected.
Talk to everyone. Make the rounds and repay the attention you're getting. Say hi to the people you know, and introduce yourself to those that you don't. Make everyone feel like they're on your radar.
Make sure everyone else is having fun. Fun should be your main priority. When other people see what a good time you're having, it will make them want to be around you more.

, Performing well at a given task is a good way to get noticed, and will characterize you as someone with an impressive set of skills. If you're naturally studious, challenge yourself to get better grades, and offer to help others with their schoolwork. If you're the athletic type, try out for a sports team and go out for a prominent position. Even if it's just in your social life, always work hard to be the best at what you set out to do.Talk to people about your involvement in things. Mention that you're a part of the honor's society, or that you won the state wrestling tournament. It's alright to be proud of your achievements.
Don't brag about yourself. Modesty is an admirable trait of popular people.

Ask them questions, attend tutoring sessions, and show them that you put a lot of effort into your studies, and they will appreciate it and like you more.;
, Don't spend the whole class talking to your friends, texting, or sleeping - this shows disrespect for your teachers and their time. Instead, pay attention, ask questions, work hard, and your teacher will be sure to appreciate your efforts.

, Always bring your books, homework, pens and other equipment you'll need, as well as finished and correct homework. Keep your backpack organized and have a few extra pencils and other necessities, to be even more prepared.

, Bake themed cookies or bring in brownies for Halloween, Christmas, and other holidays. Decorate them with images from the occasion, like pumpkins for Halloween and snowflakes for the winter holidays. Share them with your class, or just bring them for your teacher. If you aren't a good chef, try arts and crafts. Make them a card or try some origami. They really appreciate the thought of a homemade gift.

, Talk to your teacher after class and ask questions that go beyond the material you learn in class. For instance, tell your English teacher that you really enjoyed the book you read in class, and ask for recommendations of other, similar books to read. Share your interests with your teacher and ask about theirs. This will help you establish a relationship that goes beyond the classroom and class material, and will help make your teacher like you.

, In order to become popular, you do not conform to societal norms or completely reinvent yourself. Strive to develop into the best version of yourself—the most compassionate, spunky, authentic you. As you become self aware, your confidence will grow. You will become more adventurous, passionate, and interesting. Your social anxiety will decrease and people will be more drawn to you.


Discover what you believe in and who you are independently from others.
Don’t alter your personality to fit in or to try to get people to like you., Never compromise your personal beliefs and opinions in exchange for popularity. Instead, openly embrace what you believe in and love. Start new trends, instead of following old ones., Never underestimate the power of humility. People that take themselves too seriously are difficult to be around—lighten up and live a little! Likewise, it is not attractive to brag about your accomplishments, money, or things— wait for others congratulate or compliment you.


When you make a mistake or a social faux pas, don’t be afraid to laugh at yourself.
When you accomplish something incredible or do something wonderful for another person, don’t broadcast your achievement.
When you get a new outfit or item, don’t rub it in others’ faces., Taking pride in your appearance is one of the simplest ways to improve your social prospects and alter the way people think about you. You do not have to wear expensive or trendy clothes to become popular. Instead, aim to look presentable at all times—put thought into your outfits, hairstyles, and personal hygiene. Experiment with developing your own eclectic sense of style., While popular people are not always liked by everyone, they are known by everyone. In order to increase your popularity, you need to broaden your social circle. Go out of your way to meet and hang out with new people.Smile and say “Hi” to everyone you meet.
Eat lunch with someone new.

, As you strive to become popular, don’t tear others down in the process.Remember, a kind, compassionate person wins over more friends than a nasty, unconfident person. Never judge people, but always jump to their defense. Don’t bully others, but befriend them.Be kind to people outside your group. Being a clique that despises outsiders will not earn you many friends beyond the group. Instead, work to earn the respect and friendship of outsiders.

, Helping others accomplish their goals and reveling in their success, is an excellent way to develop a positive reputation. Set aside your desire for attention or your need to be the best. Instead, encourage and assist those around you as they strive to succeed. Your compassion will surprise and delight others.Offer to help someone with their homework or a project.
Stay after practice to workout with a teammate.
Congratulate others on their accomplishments.

, Bullies, haters, negative and unkind people will always be present in your life whether you are popular or an outcast. You may know these individuals or they may be complete strangers to you. In order to lead a healthy life and live as the most authentic you—even if you never become popular—it is important that you address and cope with people that dislike you.


Remove toxic people from your environment. Stop spending time with that negative friend that always belittles you.
Stand up for yourself. Let this person know that you do not appreciate and will no longer tolerate their negative treatment of you.
Don’t take it personally. Bullying is not a reflection on you, but a self-reflection on the bully. You are not the problem; they are they problem., Exposing yourself to new experiences and adventures is an excellent way to develop self-confidence and meet new people. When someone asks you to try something new, don’t be afraid to say “yes.” Set aside any anxiety or doubts and immerse yourself in the opportunity to expand your horizons. You may discover a new hobby or develop a new friendship along the way.Try new restaurants.
Sign up for an art class or work-out class.
Learn how to play a new instrument.

, Going to sporting events and parties are excellent ways to expand your social circle and increase your popularity. These events provide you with a chance to interact with others in a more relaxed and intimate environment.


Mix and mingle with new people at a tailgate.
Get to know your co-workers at a holiday party.

, Participating in extracurricular activities is a wonderful way to increase your social circle and popularity. You will form lasting relationships with your fellow members. Your accomplishments will attract the attention and praise of those around you.Try out for the school musical.
Join the debate team.
Run for student council.

Mingle with different crowds.,
Put yourself in the spotlight.,
Sit with different people at lunch.,
Make plans and accept invitations.,
Follow school events.",How to Become a Social Butterfly in High School1," Identify the cliques at your school, and then make it a habit to interact with all (or most) of them. Don’t limit yourself to one crowd! The key to being a social butterfly is being able to flit from one situation to another with ease, so the more groups you are friendly with, the easier that becomes.


Being friendly with a variety of people expands your social circle greatly and provides opportunities to attend all sorts of different events. This leads to meeting even more new people!
Put yourself out there and you will see results.;
, Being a social butterfly doesn’t mean you always have to be the person to initiate every conversation. By putting yourself in the spotlight, people will learn your name and recognize who you are. This often leads to them starting conversations with you instead of the other way around!


Participate in class. Join or start a club. Run for student council. Put yourself in situations that cause other people to notice you and they will.
Being in the spotlight provides plenty of opportunities for interaction with others and can introduce you to entirely new groups of people.

, Everyone has a group of people they usually sit with at lunch every day, but lunch can be a great time for socializing. You don’t have to abandon your usual set of friends, but after you chat with them awhile and catch up, excuse yourself to go say hi to other people.


Don’t just wander up to random tables for no reason, of course! Have reasons to initiate conversations and then stick around for a chat or short, light-hearted exchange with their group if it feels natural to do so.
A reason for approaching a group can be as simple as asking one of them about a homework assignment. Don’t make it complicated, and keep the exchange casual.
Don’t stick around longer than a few minutes and definitely make a quick exit if any awkward silences ensue.

, You can talk to new people until you’re blue in the face, but your social circle won’t truly expand until you start developing your relationships with new friends. Make plans with a new pal to see the movie you talked about at lunch last week, or ask someone from class if they want to study or do homework after school.


Whenever you get an invitation from someone to hang out or go to a particular event, make every effort to do so. You can’t say yes to every invitation all the time, but if it’s feasible, get out there and socialize!

, Keep up with what’s going on at school and try to make it out to a variety of different events so that you can meet a wide range of people. Attend a basketball game, volunteer to help organize prom, check out the theater group’s new play – no matter what you choose to do, it’s inevitable that you will meet new people, create bonds, and widen your social circle. Before you know it, you’ll be that social butterfly that you’ve always envisioned yourself to be.

Remember names.,
Give genuine compliments.,
Relate to others.,
Look interested.,
Enjoy conversations.",How to Become a Social Butterfly in High School2," When you meet someone new, make it a point to cement that person’s name in your mind. Write the person’s name down if you have to. The next time you see them, say hello and use their name. It sounds like such a small thing, but people feel recognized and important when they hear their own names.When you are in conversation with someone, sprinkle their first name in a few times. Do it smoothly and simply. Saying things like, “Hi, Erin! Did you do today’s reading assignment?” and “Michael, what do think about the new history teacher?”
Using someone's name is one of the very easiest ways to get someone’s attention and it makes them feel respected and remembered.
Use the name that someone gives you, not a nickname. For instance, if someone introduced himself as “Robert” don’t call him Rob or Bob unless he invites you to.
Don’t avoid saying someone’s name because you are unsure of the pronunciation. Instead, just go for it and say, “Please let me know if I’m not pronouncing that right.”

, Avoid saying things just to feed someone’s ego or get their attention. When you give someone a real compliment that you honestly mean, that person can feel that it’s genuine. Not only will the person feel flattered, but they will remember you for it.


Get in the habit of noticing the small things about others and pointing those things out rather than delivering vague compliments. If you can, combine a compliment with a question, which will get a conversation started.
Instead of, “You look really pretty today, Jennifer” try something more specific like, “Your hair looks so good today! How do you get it like that?” or “I love that shade of lipstick, where did you get it?”

, One of the best ways to start conversations and make friends is to relate to the person you are talking to. When you steer a conversation in a direction that allows you to relate to someone, it creates the feeling of sharing something. It forms a kind of bond between the two of you, and even if it’s a small one, it’s a start.


For instance, perhaps someone you'd like to get to know better is talking before class about not understanding last night’s algebra homework. Join in the conversation by saying something like, “I didn’t understand it either! I’m definitely going to ask the teacher about it today,” or something to that effect.

, You aren’t going to be interested in everything that people say to you all the time. It’s just not possible. But make an effort to at least appear interested and engaged in the conversations you’re having.


Smile, nod, and ask a simple question every now and then to show that person that you’re listening to them.
By making yourself available and open to listening to what they have to say, they will feel closer to you. Sometimes people just need to be heard.

, Getting in the habit of small talk and chatting takes practice, but don’t let it become an empty gesture. Be lively, make jokes when appropriate, and talk about topics you genuinely find interesting whenever possible. This makes chatting with others so much easier, and you’ll find that both of you will start looking forward to future conversations with one another.

Prepare your intro.,
Smile!,
Watch your body language.,
Bond on social media first.",How to Become a Social Butterfly in High School3," Often the hardest part of making new friends is breaking the ice. Work on a generic, simple routine for introducing yourself to others and modify it to fit each new situation and person. Incorporate a question into your introduction so that the other person will have to strike up a conversation with you, even if it’s a short one.


Practicing your intro in your head is definitely helpful, but you must practice it on actual people to get it to really stick.
If you want to approach someone but you don’t feel prepared, go home that night and think about what you want to say, and try it the next day.

, Even if you’re feeling nervous, always try to start conversations with a smile. It immediately makes the other person feel relaxed and friendly toward you.


Walking up to someone with a blank or scared expression on your face is not a good introduction, and can make that person feel apprehensive about what you’re about to say to them.
If you approach someone with a relaxed demeanor and easy smile, they will want to know what you’re about to say.

, You’re probably going to feel a little nervous, but work on maintaining a relaxed demeanor. Always make eye contact when you are interacting with people. Stand up straight and don’t cross your arms, since that gives off the vibe that you are uncomfortable.


It will take a little practice, but once you start making it a point to keep your body language relaxed and confident, it will start to become second nature to you.

, Making friends with someone on Facebook first, or following them on Twitter or Instagram, can be a great way to start a face-to-face conversation later. Try to keep your interactions lighthearted and natural, not creepy and stalker-ish.


“Like” their status or a picture that they post. If they post an article, link, song or anything else that you find genuinely interesting, share it on your wall or repost it. Pay attention to what the person is into – then you can approach them and talk about that band you both like, or the movie that you both want to see.
Really strive to keep interactions on social media natural and simple. Interactions online can get distorted without the aid of a facial expression and tone of voice for interpretation, so avoid heavy topics and excessive comments.
If it feels natural to do so, use social media as a tool to plan a hang-out session. If someone posts a video by a band that you like, you could approach them and say, “I saw that you like such-and-such band, too! Are you going to their concert this weekend?” Shared interests are the foundation to almost every friendship.

"
"
Confront your fears.,
Leave your comfort zone.,
Set goals.,
Start your day with positivity.,
Embrace your new self.,
Be patient.",How to Become a Social Butterfly in High School4," Think about what’s holding you back from being a social butterfly. Are you shy? New at school? Afraid others might reject you? Not good at small talk? Whatever it is, once you identify it, you can eliminate it by facing it dead on. Stop focusing on what people will say about when you walk away, and start focusing on what you want to say when you walk up to them.


When you are contemplating making a major life change, you are going to feel a little vulnerable and experience some self-doubt at first.This is normal!
Make a list of all the reasons why you want to expand your social circle and revisit it when you are feeling less than confident.
Put “what if” scenarios out of your mind. No one knows the future, so you’re just wasting time when you fret over negative “what if” thought patterns.

, In order to expand your social circle, you’ll need to start putting yourself in social situations that you aren’t used to. Start expanding your horizons in small ways and work your way up to bigger things. Pick a few events that you wouldn’t normally go to but are interested in, and make it a point to check them out.


You don’t have to be the life of the party at this stage! You are adjusting. Focus on that triumphant feeling you get when you go out and do something new.
Bring along a friend if that makes it easier for you to go to new places, especially at first. It will make it a little easier for you to transition into a different frame of mind, and you’ll have someone to talk to during those inevitable awkward moments when you are first starting out.

, Becoming a social butterfly is a process that takes time. If you go in expecting to change overnight, you may set yourself up for failure. Set small goals along the way that you can achieve and feel good about. Keep your goals simple and strive for things like introducing yourself to two new people every week and going to one place you’ve never been to before.


Write down your goals for the week and cross them off your list as you accomplish them. This will help you focus on what you need to do and give you a sense of progress and achievement.
Don’t be hard on yourself if you don’t meet all of your goals in any particular week. No one is keeping score.
If you set a goal that you can’t seem to accomplish at first, try breaking it down into smaller parts that are easier to achieve.
For example, if your goal is to get invited to a particular party or event and it doesn’t happen right away, try simplifying. Make it your new goal to chat with the host of the party at lunch that week and start saying hello in the hallways between your classes.

, Look in the mirror in the morning and tell yourself that you’re awesome, because you are! Put a sticky note on your alarm clock with a positive message on it, so that it’s the very first thing you see when you wake up. It doesn’t have to be complicated – something as simple as “Today will be a good day!” can make all the difference in the world.


Do other things that make you feel good, like blasting your favorite song on the way to school.
Eat a good breakfast so that you’re ready to face the day.

, To really change things up, you have to shed your old perceptions about yourself and embrace a new you. Don’t let your past define you, especially not in a bad way. Turn your negative perceptions around and make them work for you.


Maybe you are quiet and you like to read. Instead of letting that hold you back from socializing, use it to put yourself in situations where you can socialize about books!
For instance, you could join (or even start) a book club at school. If you’re reading something cool in English class, take notice of who’s participating in class, sit by them and start chatting about the book.
It’s much easier to talk to people and make new friends when you are talking about something that really interests you.

, Don’t get discouraged if you aren’t seeing results right away. It takes time to build new friendships and explore new places. One action won’t suffice – instead, it takes many small actions to make a big life change.Focus on ways to reach out to new people and broadening your horizons and you’ll find that the rest will start to naturally unfold.

Eat healthy.,
Get in shape.,
Take care of your skin.,
Take care of your nails.",How to Be the Prettiest Girl in School1," This is an important step in making your body and mind better. It can also clear up your skin and give you more energy. Adding fruits and vegetables to your existing diet, swapping out regular pasta for whole grain options, and changing red or fatty meats for leaner options are great ways to eat healthier. You should limit the amount of salt you include in your diet. Look for low-sodium versions of the foods most likely to have high amounts of salt like sauces, dressings, and prepared soups.For example, if a recipe calls for a few vegetables, you can add a greater variety or increase the amount the recipe calls for.
If a recipe calls for spaghetti, try a whole wheat pasta instead. If a recipe calls for ground beef, use ground turkey or chicken instead.
Avoid processed foods as much as possible.;
, Take the time to work on getting more fit. The endorphins you get from working out can make you feel happier and more confident about your body. You don't need to be super skinny or have a particular body shape to be pretty. Being healthy by exercising can make you pretty no matter what your body looks like.


There are so many ways you can get fit. Many people go running every day. Some people do workout videos. Some people go to the gym. Others use fitness games, hand weights, run up and down the stairs, hike, or just dance around the house.You should really talk to your doctor before you start any kind of new and vigorous workout routine. Your doctor can best assess what your body can handle.

, Following a good skin care routine can also help you look prettier. At a minimum you should use a cleanser and moisturizer every day and a facial scrub a few times a week.Using a sheer moisturizer with SPF can give you a natural looking dewy glow.Use a loofah in the shower to get rid of dead skin and keep your skin looking bright and fresh., Eating a healthier diet can indirectly help the health of your nails, but there's also plenty you can do to benefit your nails directly. Having nice-looking nails can help make you look more attractive. Clean your nails every day with soap and water, and trim them every one to two weeks, depending on how long you like them to be. You should also shape your nails so that all look uniform and neat.If you notice that having longer nails leads to breakage and peeling in your nails, keep them a bit shorter. Having healthy nails is much more important than having long nails.
Try to save any crazy nail art for the weekend and keep your nails neat with only one color or a clear polish on them during the week."

Wear clothes that flatter your body.,
Always look put together.,
Do your hair.,
Spend some time on your makeup.,
Have good posture.",How to Be the Prettiest Girl in School2," Your clothes should fit well, look neat, and be a little on the classier side. Dressing to flatter your body shape is a simple way to look prettier.If you have a circle shape (sometimes called an apple shape) avoid clothing that draws attention to your midsection, like high-rise pants or belts. Slim cut pants, shift dresses, and tunic tops are good choices if you have a circle shape.If you have a triangle shape – wider at the hips than at the shoulders or torso – avoid oversize clothing, skinny jeans, and any flimsy, body-hugging fabrics. Wide leg pants, tailored jackets, and boat neck tops will flatter your body.If you have an hourglass shape, with a larger chest, narrow waist and full hips, avoid styles without a lot of shape, like boxy dresses, tunics, or oversize cardigans. You should favor high-waisted pants, wrap dresses, and v-neck tops.If you have a rectangle-shaped body (sometimes called a boy shape), avoid tight dresses which emphasize your shape and any tops that aren’t structured. Boots cut pants and a fitted jacket will favor your body type., Being pretty is often about looking put together – like you spent some time thinking about your look before you left the house. How you do this depends a lot on your personal style, but doing things like making sure your hair is brushed and styled, or that you’re wearing a few cute accessories, or that you’ve really worked on dressing to flatter your body type can all help.

, It’s easy to run some product through your hair or just throw it up in a ponytail before you run out of the door in the morning. But paying attention to your hair is an easy way to look prettier. Experiment with your hair to find easy, go-to styles for your length and texture.


If you get in a pinch during the day and you find your hair is starting to frizz, you can add a small amount of your moisturizer to your hair., Everyone has different preferences for how they like their makeup to look. But applying just some basic foundation, mascara, and concealer can make you look prettier. Use your fingers to apply your foundation for a sheerer look or a brush for more coverage. Brush some loose finishing powder to your T-zone - down your nose and across your forehead - to prevent oil from coming through your foundation.You can prepare your eyelids for any type of look by using a matte eyeshadow that matches the lightest part of your skin - usually your neck. Brush this shadow on your lid, in your crease, and up to your brow bone. You can also use an actual eye makeup base for this as well., Confidence is really attractive, and one of the easiest ways to exude confidence is by improving your posture. When you're standing, put your shoulders back, and look straight ahead (not at the floor). If you're sitting, try to resist the temptation of hunching over your desk or table. Instead, pretend like there's a string that goes through the top of your head and down your spine, and that that string is always pulled tight.You’ll be surprised how much better you feel and look if you improve your posture."
"
Don’t be cruel.,
Be confident.,
Smile more.,
Be yourself.",How to Be the Prettiest Girl in School3," Lots of popular culture suggests that the prettiest girls are also the cruelest. You don’t have to be mean to be pretty; in fact, it makes you less attractive. Be kind to people instead: ask them how they are and offer help if you see them struggling., People who are confident always seem more attractive to others. A great way be confident is by preparing yourself for situations you might be in. This means showing up to class having done your homework, do some extra research on the company you're interviewing with, or even just looking up which movies are playing before you make plans with your friends., People who smile generally look prettier than people who frown all the time. Smiling more can help you look prettier, and it also makes you seem more approachable., Have you ever noticed how people who seem to know who they are and have no problem being themselves seem more attractive? Sticking to your own style, whether it’s with make-up, your clothes, or your accessories, can help you look prettier. One of the easiest ways to be yourself is by following your intuition, sometimes called following your ""gut."" If something just doesn't feel right to you - whether it's a certain type of clothing, a makeup look, or an activity that your friends or significant other wants you to do - don't do it."

Organize your time.,
Create your own learning environment.,
Balance schoolwork and other commitments.,
Be curious and dare to try something new.,
Be passionate and challenge yourself.",How to Develop Academic Potential and Become a Better Student," Many teachers advocate the use of a planner, but the truth is each individual has his/her own style of keeping track of things and prioritizing tasks. However, regardless of whether you are using a digital planner like Google Calendar, an online task management service, or simply a printed calendar, it is vital that you create a schedule that makes the best use of your precious time. Planning and structuring your time will also ensure that you do not lose sight of any important deadlines and assignments.


It's always helpful to remember that the purpose of a schedule, after all, is to prioritize tasks based on value. Thus, you should be prepared to adapt your schedule, as the value of certain tasks and activities changes constantly as unexpected opportunities and responsibilities surface.;
, Whether that means finding a room that has suitable lighting and tasteful furniture, or locating that ""quiet place"" with minimal disturbance that is a safe distance away from any distractions, it's essential that you find a place (and time) that fosters your intellectual growth.


In regards to time, make sure that you are 100% committed when you are studying. It's not only a good idea to take a break once in a while--it's absolutely necessary, but make certain that you are devoting all of your intellectual resources to one task at a time, so that you can finish everything to the best of your abilities in a short period of time.

, Contrary to popular stereotypes regarding ""bookworms"" and ""nerds"", some of the most successful and efficient students are those that excel both in the classroom and in greater society. Getting to know your classmates may be just as valuable as studying for that upcoming calculus examination--not only will you be able to ""de-stress,"" but you might even be able to learn something about their techniques that can change (for the better) your learning habits.


In addition, it may be a good idea to organize your own ""study group."" Hosting it via an online chat service is always a good idea, so that meetings are need-based and purpose-driven, not meaningless.

, Explore the curriculum, as well as subjects you are interested in, beyond the classroom. If you're studying a language, for example, visiting a foreign country that speaks your language would perhaps be a fascinating opportunity to not only learn about culture but also improve your skills in a native environment. Another example would be writing--try your hand at creative writing in your free time, or edit/write online articles in places like wikiHow and Wikipedia to improve your grammar, sentence structure, and your ability to communicate ideas in a brief fashion. If you're studying accounting, perhaps an internship at your local grocer or business would be a beneficial experience. These opportunities will not only allow you to better comprehend the material you are learning and allow you to experience it first-hand, but it may also lead to interesting career development opportunities and paths that you may not have considered (not to mention the networking benefits from some employment opportunities). As Confucius said, ""I hear and I forgetI see and I rememberI do and I understand.""

, While a part of your course selection may already be predetermined due to the required course(s) at your institution, it's always important to follow your passions when you are able to do so. In choosing courses, make sure to challenge yourself as well--that's the point of an education, right? If you don't or aren't willing to learn anything new, you defeat the point of an education, and you might as well be sleeping the entire day.

Familiarize yourself with the available positions.,
Decide on a platform.,
Practice public speaking.,
Network.,
Get involved.,
Form a team.,
Advertise.,
Write a great speech.,
Be respectful, whether you win or lose.",How to Get On Student Council," Student council comes with a variety of available positions. From president to treasurer, learn about the available spots to see where you would best fit in the world of student politics.


The president of student council is generally responsible for arranging and running meetings with other student council members, making sure everyone does their job, and approving any events, fundraisers, budgets, or other plans and decisions made by student council. The vice president essentially assists the president with his or her duties.
The class secretary should be a very well organized person who's good at taking notes. Your job is to take minutes at meetings, keep student council related materials organized, getting important information to class officers, and scheduling meetings.The class treasurer is responsible for managing the funds of student council. The treasurer keeps track of spending and is generally required to provide some sort of monthly report outlining financial decisions made by student council.In most schools, each class has a class representative for their year. Class reps usually represent the interests of their grade at student council meetings and events., The keep to becoming a successful student council member is having a central belief system. If you want to run for student council, you have to have some kind of platform or ideology that drives your campaign.


A platform should be your summary of things at your school you want to change. Think about your experience as a student. What has been satisfactory? What has not? What would you like to change and what changes can you reasonably see made as a student council member?Talk to other students. Ask them about their concerns and opinions on the school and how it's being run. Ask them what they'd like to see change. Remember, however, that you need to be realistic. You can't promise, for example, two hours of lunchtime and no chemistry requirements. Try to fish out concerns that are legitimate. Are students concerned about bullying in your school? Do they want more diverse options for electives? Do they feel hot lunch options are not fair to students with certain food sensitivities? These are the kinds of concerns that you should take seriously., You'll have to do some public speaking as a member of the student council. In most schools, you'll have to give a speech during the election season. Make sure you're comfortable with speaking in front of an audience.


Start small, especially if you're shy. Volunteer to speak during class. Talk to a stranger in the hallway.
Ask your family for help. Practice giving a monologue from a play or movie in front of your parents.
Try out for activities that require public speaking. Join the debate club. Try out for a play., Students who are well known in the school tend to be more likely to win at student council. While you shouldn't strive to make friends just to get votes, getting to know your classmates a bit can help..


Talk to people you don't normally talk to. People get stuck in ruts, especially in big schools, and tend to end up talking to a small circle of people. Branch out. Sit at a different table at lunch. Join an after school club with people who share your interests. Talk to a student you don't speak to much on the bus ride home.Be friendly to everyone. Being mean to be people or shunning people for being uncool won't win you any votes. Try to be nice to everyone you meet. This can lead to gaining the votes you need to win., You'll need credentials if you want to be on student council. Get involved in your school. The more you have on your resume, the more experienced and qualified for the position you'll look.


Join an after school club you're passionate about. If you love to write, join the newspaper. If you're interested in politics, try Model UN. Being involved can be impressive when you're running for office.Try to cater your involvement to the position you want. If you want to be president, look for leadership opportunities. If you want to be treasurer, a club related to math could help.

, Once you start your campaign, form a campaign team. Get a group of students together to help you run. These can be friends but they can also people you know from clubs or organizations you're involved with. You can also ask around and see if anyone would be interested in helping based on your political platform.

, As the campaign starts, you'll need to advertise you're running. Make posters and fliers to hang up around the school.


Try to make your posters aesthetically pleasing. People tend to respond to visuals, so a nice picture of yourself will help. Make sure your name is in big lettering as name recognition can help.Ask teachers where it's okay to hang your posters. You don't want to risk having posters taken down by staff members because they were in an area where they're not allowed.
If social media is allowed at your school, consider making a Facebook page advertising your campaign.

, You'll have to write a speech for your campaign. A good speech should have three parts: an introduction, a body, and a conclusion.


The introduction should briefly state your name, what position you're running for, and hint at your platform. A good introduction should start with a hook that gets the audience invested. Consider starting with a quote from a public figure you admire. You can also start with a joke, something like, ""I know what you're thinking - what's this guy doing running for student council?""The body of your speech, which should be about two paragraphs long, should outline your goals. Go back to the reasons you decided to run. What do you want to change about the school? Why do you feel these changes are needed? You should also touch on your experience. Why are you the best person to make these changes?The conclusion should briefly reiterate your points and then end by politely asking students for your votes. Try to come off as humble, as overly boastful politicians can be off-putting. Ask students to do you the honor of voting for you this election., If you win or lose, be respectful. Congratulate the other candidate if you lost. If you won, thank the other candidates for being worthy opponents. If you do not win, do not get too down. You can also run again next year or next semester.

Make sure you really want the job.,

, Make sure he or she is confident. Also, make sure he or she doesn't do anything stupid such as ripping down opponent's posters. You could also choose a help committee: two Poster Makers, one Publicist (makes sure that posters are put up, website works, and everything is in place), Webmaster (creates and runs a website for you - this may cost some money), one Stunts person (see #6)

,, Make it humorous, but also touch a little bit on the major issues.

,, Even better, make a group on Facebook and invite all your friends. Put up either a funny, or if not funny, very good picture of you for the group's profile picture.

,, Smile in the hallways. Make eye contact. They'll care if you're responsible, but if they like you, so much better.

, It helps if you have a reputation for being smart, which you are.

, This means a balance of humor and seriousness. Don't ramble on about what you'd do as president, but don't fill the entire thing with jokes, either. Take one general thing about your class and concentrate the speech on that one thing. For instance, take a class's ""personality."" Talk about how great the class's personality is. This will stir up pride in most every classmate of yours, regardless of social status and personal interests. This is especially effective in a small school. Make a promise during your speech, but do not make false promises. If you win and do not keep your promises everyone will be disappointed with you. Be loud and interesting. Have confidence; fake confidence if you don't think you have any. After all, once they hear your speech, they'll be wowed into checking off your name of the ballot.

Be a good influence on others.

",How to Become Student Council President of Middle School," Though you certainly don't have to become lifelong best friends with every student, you must be polite to everyone and eliminate any shyness you might have. If you see someone sitting alone, strike up a conversation with them.;
, Putting up posters for a make-believe campaign is not a good start to your career in politics.

, Make sure they are eye-catching and have cute slogans. Being original shows people you can have original ideas in the future. For example: Making the world a better place since (insert birth year). (insert name).

, Don't say you'll bring a unicorn to school or anything your school's funds can't easily afford. Give the reasons you're qualified (do you volunteer with Habitat For Humanity? Have you been in student council since sixth grade? Things like that.), why you want to run, a sample of your ideas, and some of the steps you would take to achieve them. Spend time on your speech, and be sure to edit it several times. Finally, make sure you know your speech well enough to make contact with your audience while saying it in a confident voice (memorizing it might be a good idea, but you certainly don't have to).

, Candy, chips, cute accessories, etc. More people will think, Oh yeah, she's/he's cool. Make sure you're not violating any school rules by doing this before you go ahead with it, though; being disqualified won't exactly help your chances at being elected.

, It will surely increase the number of votes you get.

Don't do stupid things like drinking and driving, or any other drugs.",How to Be the School Celebrity (Teen Girls)," It has to be unique, bold, and all your own! Think Taylor Swift's sweet, country girl style with those curly blond locks. Or Justin Bieber's famous hair flip. Or Lady Gaga's wild, totally unique fashion style. When it comes to your own, play to your strengths! Do you have curly hair? Set it free! Blond hair? Go platinum! Don't be afraid to be bold and creative.;
, Put your heart and soul into it; if it's cheerleading, find a way to make yourself captain. If it's singing, join the choir/glee club and rock the stage! Whatever it is, own it!

, What's the point in being the center of attention if it's for all the rumors you spread? When you meet someone, smile and try to act interested in what the other person has to say. Make friends with everyone, not just the popular people.

, Don't post sloppy messages with tons of slang and horrible grammar. Not saying you have to be the grammar police, but make sure your posts and comments are readable, and look at least somewhat professional. Don't overload on the emoticons, and don't be one of those people who posts what their doing every five minutes. Two or three posts a week should do it, but make sure you actually have something to say, not just ""I'm bored"".

, A celebrity is constantly in the spotlight! Even though it may be hard sometimes, maintaining a cool head and pleasant disposition will increase people's respect of you. Try to give good advice. (Just don't become an Agony Aunt.)

, Though it may seem cool on people like Ke$ha, that sort of thing can ruin your whole life. Plus, if you really want to make it big someday, it's going to be kind of hard from inside a jail cell!

Understand what being section leader means.,
Lead by example.,
Get on friendly terms with your section.,
Learn your music.,

Be on the same page as your co-section leader, if you have one.,
Remember the team.,
Always think about what you could do to improve yourself, you are not perfect.,
Admit that you are in the wrong sometimes.,
Do not dwell on mistakes your section makes, address the issue quickly then move on.,
Stay positive if you have a bad attitude the whole section will follow your lead.",How to Be a Good Section Leader," Being a section leader is harder than being a non-section leader; not only do you have to worry about your music, but you have to worry about the music of your section. It also doesn't mean you get to be some dictator; you have to help your section. It's a lot like being an administrator on a website; you're a regular editor, but with a mop. You are there to serve the people in your section, not to rule over them.;
, Not only will this let your section know what to do, but it is also a very kind method of leadership. You were most likely chosen because of your playing or marching skills; now is your time to pass these on.

, When you become friends with your section, they'll be more likely to listen to you, and you'll get a better feel of their playing ability.

, As section leader, you're expected to know it before everyone else. If you don't know your music, how can you help others with their music?

, Sectionals are time when your section is the focus, not the entire band. Find the difficult passages and go over them with your section. Make sure your section knows exactly what they're trying to fix; if they don't know what they're trying to fix, it probably won't get fixed.

, Let them practice, but if you see someone struggling with a part or playing it wrong without realizing it, go and help them.

, If someone said they'll learn a passage by next Tuesday, they better have it down when next Tuesday comes rolling by. If they don't, ask them why they didn't.

, If someone can't make it to the sectional because their grandma died, don't hold that to him. People have lives outside of marching band.

, You're still a member of your section, and your extra authority doesn't mean you can't take part in the rest of the section's festivities. In fact, spending more time with your section only makes you a better leader.

, This doesn't mean order them around, but when they get out of hand, let them know. If necessary, seek help from another section leader or the band teacher. Remember, rehearsal time is limited and essential to the success of the whole band. Keep your section quiet and focused so they don't miss important instruction.

, If there's a conflict between two sides, you will probably have to be the third party to step in and solve it. If it starts to get physical, keep them apart and tell someone to get help from an adult as soon as possible.

, If you're telling your section something completely different than the other section leader, it will only confuse your section.

, No matter what goals you may have for your section, don't lose sight of what is best for the entire band. Each section must work together to achieve what is best for the entire ensemble. Your band directors and drum majors goals should take priority over your own. Also, being a section leader is a privilege, not a right. Remember... with great power comes great responsibility, as said by Uncle Ben.

, Make yourself approachable and ask what you need to do to improve your skills, or how you handle situations.

, There is nothing more irritating than having a leader that thinks they are right about everything. You are human you make mistakes be a big enough person to admit your wrongs and move on.

, You know how teachers rant about how we are wasting time by talking, but the teacher rants for 20 minutes wasting everyones time? Don't be that leader, say what you have to say quickly.

, If your having a bad day tell your section and then push yourself to be positive. This will increase productivity and will keep your director happy.

Read the play thoroughly.,
Be responsible.,
Be supportive of other participants.,
Be prepared.,
Read out the part confidently.,
Conclude the audition.,
Await confirmation.",How to Be the Main Part in the School Play1," Consider how you will portray this role and what are the key aspects of the character. Often, people try to portray themselves and not actually take on the guise of another character so you need to be flexible enough to not act how you would normally.;
, The teacher will note this and think you're positively dedicated to the main role. Its important to show that you are sincere and skilled enough to take the role, as well as the commitment of learning the lines and attending rehearsal, as well as keeping up with your homework and chores.

, Everyone needs support, but you can also learn a lot about acting by watching how other people portray the character.

, If you are allowed to dress in character, then do so to give the best presentation. Practice your lines to be sure that you are very familiar with them. Never be late to rehearsals, ideally be there 10-15 minutes early. The lead role of the cast is in fact a leadership role to the rest of the cast so it is important to demonstrate your leadership skills and responsibility.

, Gesture and give facial expressions as appropriate, remember to smile when it is important to smile as these gestures play as much part of the role as the lines. Take the lead from the prompt (who is usually the teacher) and follow their instructions, particularly if they wish to see you present the role in different way.


Changing the style of the presentation on request is often called improvisation, where you have to improvise a different style or scenario for your character. This demonstrates how good an actor you are as well as how responsible you are. When a person forgets a line in front of an audience, its usually best to improvise a way to make it look like no one has forgotten the line at all, rather than to wait for them to remember or for the prompt. Being considerate to your fellow actors and stage crew is an important skill and demonstrates your maturity.

, Generally, bowing at the end of an audition is not necessary and can seem trite. It's best to listen to all suggestions the teacher gives you and then give way for other people to have a try.

, Generally, its best to be aware when the announcement will be and to talk to your teacher afterwards to see if they feel you have a chance, or what they suggest to improve your chances. Chasing after teachers however will often be unproductive so its best to be respectful.

"
"
Continue to practice.,
Attend every rehearsal that you can.,
Be aware of props and timing.",How to Be the Main Part in the School Play2," Lunch break and after school can be a good time to practice lines. If you have to cry in your role, dance or sing, practice these in balance so that other aspects of your schoolwork don't fall behind. Collaborate with your fellow actors often when rehearsing in your breaks as that way you can get a good idea of their movements and manners and can gain some skills and ideas from them.


Your friends may become jealous of the fact that you got the main part, its best to involve them where you can in practicing, or to find out if they can join in in other ways.

, If you cannot make it because of your home duties, be sure to advise the teacher as well as other actors so they can fill in for you or reschedule.

, Be sure that you know where every prop that you use is prepared and where it will be. Leaving it to the last minute, if it is your responsibility, can cause big problems and will cause a lot of conflict within the cast and crew.

"
"
Be at the theatre early.,
Stretch and relax.,
Relax into the role.,
Go to the toilet before the performance.,
Check with the stage manager during intervals.,
Thank your teacher as well as the cast and crew afterwards.",How to Be the Main Part in the School Play3," This is not only to give you ample time to get into costume, but also in case you are needed because of a script adjustment. It seldom happens but it has been known in dire circumstances that some scenes get changed or omitted at the last minute, or that something else on the stage such as the set layout has been changed.

, Even well practiced actors may feel a degree of stage fright and uncertainty. Drink adequate water to lubricate your vocal chords.

, When you know your cues, enter as befitting for the scene, remembering to smile in happy scenes and cry in emotional scenes. If you realise you have forgotten a line, keep going so that the audience and the remaining cast are not put off. It can be best to improvise one or two lines before you remember.

, Calls of nature on the stage can be a problem which will affect the performance.

, This may be the teacher, but may also be another student. They typically are given instructions or will give you suggestions, they typically have been your audience the longest and so will know your mannerisms best.

, Plays are a group effort and everyone typically puts a lot of effort into a successful performance.

Do you love helping people? Consider joining a volunteer organization for the needy. Do you have a passion for writing and enjoy working with a team? Maybe the school newspaper would be a good fit for you. If you’re a people person and you’d like to work toward the good of the school community, consider joining the student government., Run for student council. Join a few teams, clubs, or organizations and get a feel for what is a good fit for you. Get to know the other people involved in the group right off the bat. You’re not limited to student council – sports teams, language clubs, debate teams, academic teams, the school band, performing arts groups, and publications (newspaper, yearbook) are just a few examples of organizations where there are opportunities for leadership positions., For pretty much every leadership position, you have to start at the bottom and learn the ropes. This is the way you gain knowledge about the group and how things are run. Spend enough time becoming knowledgeable, and you will start becoming a person that others in the group look up to. Eventually, you’ll be able to take a leadership position., Begin assuming more responsibilities in your group. Set goals and do what it takes to accomplish them. Leaders are people who don’t wait to be told what to do; they come up with good ideas and turn their visions into reality. Be sure to communicate with others in the group about your ideas and encourage them to join you in accomplishing them., Invite outside organizations, like those that help the environment or the homeless, to your school by organizing a fundraiser. Organize special events to raise awareness of important issues or celebrations, like Cancer or HIV awareness, Black History Month, etc. Learn about what other young people do to support causes - in their communities, nationally, or even internationally., Being a leader at school doesn’t always mean you have to have perfect grades. But you should show a positive attitude toward your classes, participation, and giving out your best effort to everything.


Teachers can usually tell if you are trying your best, and so can your classmates. Make an effort to work well in groups and get along with everyone., A good leader is someone who knows the rules and who understands different positions of authority. You may not agree 100% with your teachers and parents at all times, but you should always maintain a respectful, pleasant attitude toward them.


Respect for authority prepares you for becoming an adult and entering the work world where you will have different types of bosses. Showing respect for adults now also shows your teachers, parents, and peers that you are a mature and confident leader., Come to school on time and get to each of your classes on time. Turn in your homework and other class projects on time.


Be sure you have a planner or agenda book to help you keep track of project deadlines. Write down each day the upcoming due dates for projects and homework for every class., If you know how to do something in class that others don’t, offer to help them. Ask in a nice way if you can help students with class work, as long as it’s okay with the teacher. If you finish with some work early, and notice someone else who may be struggling with it, raise your hand and ask if you can help them with it.


Helpful behavior extends to the halls too. If you see someone drop their books, help to pick them up. If a new student doesn’t know where certain things or rooms are, offer to help show them around., Be honest, don’t talk about others behind their backs, and make sure that you treat others the way you would like to be treated.


Being a trustworthy person is a quality of a good leader. If you say you are going to do something, do it. If you say one thing to one person but different things to someone else (known as being “two-faced”), it will be found out that you are not someone who can be trusted and, people don’t usually want a leader who they cannot trust., Even if you don't like a certain person, they should still be treated like everyone else. Being consistent in how you treat everyone is an important way to build and maintain trust. If someone breaks a rule, for example, be sure that they receive the same consequence that anyone else would get for breaking a rule.


Don’t play favorites with your closer friends, and don’t let your personal feelings toward someone you don’t like as much get in the way of being in a group with them. Being part of a team that is trying to accomplishing a goal means that everyone must work together; it’s not just a social gathering.
Showing fairness is something that you will notice good teachers and parents do. They try not to take sides, and make sure that the rules apply to everyone equally. Being fair and able to work with anyone also prepares you for a work environment, where you don’t usually get to choose your co-workers., Be happy and smile frequently. Don’t wear a fake smile, but being friendly and smiling frequently makes you much more approachable.


If your group is under lots of pressure, for instance your team just lost a big game, don’t become negative. Say things like, “we’ll get it next time” and “everyone did a great job, the other team just did a little better.” This will help your teammates know you believe in them and that they should keep trying hard., If there is one quality that adults notice most about student leaders, it is their ability to make all students feel welcome and respected at school.


If you notice a certain student getting picked on, stand up for them. Don’t be afraid to say, “Just leave them alone,” or something like that. It will show the students doing the bullying that you don’t think their actions are cool.
Go out of your way to include students who don’t seem to have many friends. Invite them to participate in an activity with you and some others. Say hello to them occasionally and ask how their day is. They may hesitate at first especially if they are used to kids being not nice to them, but keep trying., Learn public speaking skills and writing skills. You should be able to express yourself in a clear way, during meetings, speeches, practices, and/or games so that people are more likely to want to listen to you.


If you are in a position where you need to do public speaking, practice at home in front of a mirror. Notice your mannerisms and facial expressions while speaking. Also ask if others at home can listen to you practice your speeches and offer suggestions. Speaking to groups well takes a lot of practice – don’t get discouraged if you feel nervous or mess up the first few times. Just keep at it!
Being a good communicator also means listening well. Take time to learn what people want and care about in your group. Be sure that everyone’s voice gets to be heard, and that you consider all opinions in the group when making decisions., Have others help with the work, and distribute jobs evenly among everybody so that one person will not have to shoulder all of the work.


For instance, a team captain may give certain clean-up or uniform duties to teammates, or a newspaper editor gives out different article assignments for the staff to write. It’s important to rotate jobs around so that everyone gets equal responsibilities.
Delegating responsibilities will be up to you and the rest of the group to decide. Make sure everyone feels confident about the job they’ve been given. If a person lacks confidence about a job, you and others in the group may need to work toward encouraging them and offering help and guidance.
It is part of your job to encourage others to participate. If it feels like someone isn’t pulling their share of the work load, privately discuss this with them, and let them know you’re hoping you can count on them to contribute a little more., A good leader knows about the resources that are available to the group. If you don’t know the answer to something, or notice that something needs done but you’re not sure how to do it yourselves, you’re the one who should ask questions of your teachers, coaches, etc.


It’s your job to create access to information and to supplies that you need for various projects and activities. You are essentially the liaison between the group and the adult who oversees the entire group. Not sure where to get certain props for the musical? Discuss it with the teacher director. Suspect that your team would benefit from one extra practice per week? Bring it up to the coach. , A good leader will be willing to listen to the group when deciding if a certain rule or policy needs to be changed. Sometimes the way things have been done are outdated or could be done in a better way. Being open to change is always good.


This step goes back to being a good listener. A leader sometimes needs to step back and just listen – to the complaints or the satisfactions of the group. What is working well? What needs to be changed? Just by listening you can learn a lot that can be brought up at future decision-making meetings.
There may be uncomfortable or unexpected moments during your role as a leader. Someone may quit the group, want to make dramatic changes, or challenge your actions as the leader. How do you handle these moments? If you’re able to adapt and do your best to work it out, then you have part of what it takes to be a great leader!"

But just like you don’t fall asleep in the middle of a conversation with your friends, so too will participating in the class discussion help you stay awake.As the teacher speaks, take down notes and formulate questions about the material you're learning. If there's something you can't figure out, put up your hand and ask a question about it.
When the teacher poses questions to the class, don’t be afraid to put up your hand and provide an answer. Some teachers will put you on the spot for a while because of any noticeable inattentiveness.;
, Your teacher may not allow this, but if you are permitted, get up and go to the back of the class or to get a drink of water if you feel like you're starting to doze off. Staying active is a huge key to staying awake in class, because it keeps your mind and body alert and focused.If your teacher doesn’t have a policy about this, ask if it’s acceptable to walk around quietly during class. Many teachers would actually prefer that you do this instead of falling asleep during their lectures.

, In case your teacher doesn’t want you getting up during class time, you can still keep your body active in your chair. Move around in your chair, stretch, and exercise your limbs while staying seated.


If you feel you're nodding off, sit up straight and stretch. Move your head from side to side to make your neck limber, and gently twist sideways from the waist to stretch your back.Kick your legs in front of your desk and stretch them out, and push your arms out in front of you to stretch them as well.

, Just like stretching and moving in your chair, fidgeting can also keep your body active, and this will prevent you from getting sleepy. The important thing is to do this quietly, otherwise you may distract other students.Quietly tap your feet on the floor and your fingers on the desk.
Keep your feet planted on the floor and, with your knees bent, pump your legs up and down as though you were walking.
Hold your pen in your fingers and twirl it around or tap it in the air.

, Warmth and poor ventilation are recipes for falling asleep in class, so ask the teacher if you can open a window to let in fresh air and circulate the air in the room.If possible, sit near a window so that you can open and close the window as necessary.
If opening a window isn't an option, consider bringing a small, personal fan to class that you can use to blow air on your face when you start feeling tired.

, You can either get up and go to the bathroom, or you can bring a bottle of water with you to class that you can use to wake yourself up. Just as washing your face in the morning will wake you up, so too will splashing yourself with water in the middle of the day help revive you.


If you do this in class, bring a small towel with you that you can dampen with water to wipe on your face.

, Avoid sugary cereals and snacks at breakfast, as these will just cause a sugar crash in a couple hours, and this is a sure way to fall asleep in class. Instead, choose a breakfast that has protein, carbohydrates, and calcium. This could include:Fruit and toast with peanut butter
Fruit and leafy green smoothies with dairy, soy, or almond milk
Oatmeal with dried fruit and nuts
Homemade breakfast burritos with beans, avocado, and greens
Healthy homemade muffins

, Exercise gets your circulation pumping, increases the oxygen supply to your cells, releases good hormones, and promotes better sleep. Starting your day with a workout not only helps you get a better rest, but it will also energize you and prepare you for the day ahead. Good morning exercises include 30 minutes of:Running and jogging
Swimming
Aerobics such as jumping jacks, skipping, or running in place
Biking or using the stationary bike

, Sugar and caffeine both cause crashes, and when this happens at school, there's a good chance you'll fall asleep in class. Sugary foods include candy, sodas, chocolate bars, and even juices.Caffeine in the form of black tea or coffee can be consumed in moderation as part of a healthy diet, but be sure to spread your consumption out over the day so you don’t crash.Avoid energy drinks, which contain high amounts of sugar and caffeine, and can cause a big crash.

, Keep healthy snacks with you in case you get hungry throughout the day, and eat balanced meals at lunch and dinner as well. This will give you the fuel you need to stay awake throughout the day and in class. Make sure your meals contain:Vitamins and minerals (fruits and vegetables)
Calcium (dark leafy greens)
Lean proteins (legumes, nuts, beans, or chicken)
Good carbohydrates (whole-grain breads and pastas, or potatoes)
Healthy fats (seeds, avocados, and nuts)
Good snacks include plain crackers, crackers and cheese, vegetables and hummus, fruit, yogurt, and nuts, seeds, and dried fruit.

, Students are always trying to balance work, school, and social lives, and trying to make enough time for all these things often means they skimp on sleep. But being tired during the day means you're more likely to fall asleep in class, and even when you are awake, you will have difficulty focusing, concentrating, and retaining information.If you find you don't have time to get enough sleep because you're working too much, talk to your boss about taking fewer shifts. If you have too much homework, talk to your teachers about making more time for schoolwork during class time. If you're spending too much time with friends, restrict your social engagements to the weekends.
For students over the age of 12, you likely need anywhere between seven to 10 hours of sleep every night in order to function optimally.If you're younger than 12, you likely need around 11 hours of sleep every night.
Using caffeine to make up for a night when you didn’t get enough sleep can be dangerous, because the caffeine may prevent you from getting a proper sleep again, create a cycle of fatigue., The idea of having a bedtime may seem childish, but the routine can help you get a better night’s rest. This is especially important for people who have trouble falling asleep, because getting your body used to going to bed at the same time can help your body get on a schedule, and this may make it easier to sleep at night.


If you are going to bed at the same time every night but still wake feeling tired, try moving your bed time ahead by an hour and see how the extra hour of sleep affects your daytime wakefulness.It’s important to stick to your schedule at all times, even on weekends and holidays.

, There are a number of things that can keep you up at night or prevent you from getting a sound sleep, and avoiding them will help you get to sleep faster and stay asleep longer.Don’t exercise within three hours of going to bed, because exercise creates a rush of hormones and oxygen that will energize you and keep you from falling asleep.
Avoid eating a large meal within an hour of bed time, because feeling full and bloated can make you uncomfortable and make it difficult to sleep.
Turn the lights low and avoid electronic screens in the half-hour leading up to bedtime, as the lights will disrupt the natural circadian rhythm that governs your sleep and wake cycles.

, Sleep is extremely important for physical, mental, and emotional health, but there are a number of conditions that can prevent a person from getting to sleep or staying asleep throughout the night. If you suspect you're suffering from any of them, consult a doctor as soon as possible. Some of the more common sleep-disrupting disorders include:Periodic limb movement disorder and restless legs syndrome, where jerking legs and arms frequently disrupt sleep.
Sleep apnea causes you to wake often because you stop breathing when you're asleep.
Insomnia, which is an inability to sleep, can be caused by a wide range of factors, including stress and underlying medical issues. While most people experience short periods where it’s difficult to sleep, you should consult a doctor if the condition persists.
Narcolepsy is a condition that causes people to suddenly fall asleep, such as while sitting in class, on the bus, at a party, or in the middle of a meal.

Breathe slowly and deeply.,
Talk to yourself to calm down.,
Get all your facts in order.,
Take your time.,
Don't focus on your punishment.",How to Survive a Trip to Your School Principal1," Taking small, shallow breaths when you're nervous or stressed can lead to more anxiety. Deep breathing can help calm you down and relax your nerves before you have to go the principal. Take deep breaths in through your nose and exhale through your mouth if you're feeling nervous., If you're overwhelmed and have no one to talk to, you can talk to yourself to calm yourself down. Saying things like ""Okay, I'm not responsible for this"" or ""I'll get through this"" may allow you to relax.Keep repeating these things to yourself as you walk down the halls to your principal's office.

, You don't want to go to the principal without having any story at all. Think about the reasons why you may be in trouble and determine if you're really responsible for what happened. The reason you're getting sent to the principal may have been a misunderstanding. Think about the situation and evaluate all the details before walking into the principal's office., When you get called down the principal, you can take your time to get there. Unless there was a serious situation, your teacher will send you to the office or it'll be announced on the loudspeaker. Taking your time and walking slowly will allow you to get all the facts of your story straight and will give you the time to calm down if you're stressed., There's no way to tell what your punishment will be, or if there will be a punishment at all. Therefore, there's no reason to obsess over what might happen. Instead of focusing on the outcome of your meeting with the principal, concentrate on getting all of your facts correct and work on breathing and relaxing."

Sit up straight and speak clearly.,
Be truthful.,
Tell your side of the story.,
Don't interrupt or talk over the principal.,
Take personal responsibility for your actions.",How to Survive a Trip to Your School Principal2," Body language is an important factor in how your principal looks at you. Make sure to straighten your clothing, sit up straight, and shake your principal's hand when you meet them. When you talk to the principal, don't mumble and speak as clearly as possible so that you give them a good impression. This may make the entire conversation smoother., Sometimes people get so scared of getting into trouble that they may lie or make things up to get out of it. This can backfire and get you into more trouble than if you just told the truth. When you start talking to the principal, don't make things up and remain honest.Lying here or there will make the principal question other things in your story.
Lying can cause more stress later on because you'll have to stick to your false story and it can be hard to remember made-up details.

, Tell the principal in detail what happened and don't leave anything out. Explain why you did what you did, and what led to the situation that you're getting in trouble for. Try to include as many details as you can so that the principal gets an accurate picture of the situation.


For instance, you can say, ""Joe put his foot out and tripped Maryanne, but she turned around and thought it was me. The teacher didn't see exactly what happened, so she assumed that Maryanne was right.""
Or you could say, ""Raul started screaming in my face, so I screamed back. He got mad because I called him out for how he treats other students and that's when he started punching me. I was just trying to get him off of me, I didn't really want to fight.""

, Talking over or interrupting the principal is rude. If the principal is annoyed with you, it may mean a harsher punishment. Instead, let the principal talk and answer their questions as they ask them.Talking over someone may also cause them to mirror your behavior, and it could prevent you from telling your side of the story.

, If you know that you did something wrong, it's best to take responsibility for your actions early on. This will actually make your principal respect you more. Think about what you did, what caused you to do it, and acknowledge the fact that you made a mistake.You can say something like ""I shouldn't have pushed John back, I can admit that. I was just angry that he shoved me, and it was an automatic response. It's not how I usually am, but I was wrong.""
Or something like, ""Honestly, I did skip school that day. I don't really have a good explanation, but now I know it's wrong and I take full responsibility for what I did. I just hope that it doesn't lessen all of the good stuff I've done over the school year.""

Talk to your parents or trusted adult about your issues.,
Stop trying to impress classmates with bad behavior.,
Think before you act.,
Don't hang out with people who get you into trouble.",How to Survive a Trip to Your School Principal3," If you try to stay out of trouble but can't stop your behavior no matter what you do, it could be because of circumstances in your life or a medical condition like ADHD. Talk to an understanding adult that can help with things going on in your life. Explain your emotions to them so that people can get a better understanding of who you are as a person.You can also ask an adult about the right strategies to use when talking to teachers or authority figures.

, You may enjoy the attention that you get from your classmates when you get in trouble, but you are the one that has to face the punishment for your actions. Try to find other ways to be popular in school, like being good at sports or art., Always think about the potential repercussions of your actions before you do them. More than thinking about the punishment you may get for your actions, think about how they will affect other people's lives. Be compassionate for other people, and always think about how your actions will affect you and others.


For instance, if you feel like trashing the lunchroom or leaving packets of ketchup on the floor, think about the person who has to clean it up and how it makes their day harder.
If you bully other people and make them feel bad about themselves, try to think about how it would make you feel if someone targeted you in the same way.

, Sometimes you may feel like you don't have a choice with who we are friends with, but you do. If you have friends who are always getting into trouble and getting you in trouble, you need to stand up against them. Either let them know that you're tired of risking it and getting in trouble, or tell them that you can't hang out with them anymore. Doing this should cut down on how often you're getting into trouble."

Make sure you have enough time to get ready and get to school in the morning so you don’t have to rush. Wake up 15-30 minutes before you normally do if you are having trouble getting to school on time.
, Focus your attention on the teacher and the lesson. Refrain from distractions like talking to your friends, passing notes, or looking at your cell phone. Rather than staring off into space or out the window, focus your attention on your teacher and what they are saying.

, Taking notes will keep you on track as well as help you remember the material you are being taught. Write down key words, definitions, equations, tips, and tricks that your teacher mentions., If your teacher asks a question and you know the answer, raise your hand. You can also ask questions or get clarification on things that are confusing. Participating in class will show your teacher that you are listening and trying to learn the material, which they will surely appreciate it., When your teacher assigns something, listen carefully to what they say and follow their directions. Do what is expected of you, even if you don’t really want to. It’s not up to you to determine if an assignment is worthy, you still need to complete it.

For example, if your teacher tells your class to pair up and discuss a book you’re reading, do so. Don’t ignore their instructions or talk to your partner about other things, simply bring up an interesting point about the book and ask your partner what they think about it.

, Make a planner that you can list all your assignments in so that you know what to do each day. Stick to your schedule and wait to play video games or hang out with your friends until your homework is done.

You can also pack your backpack each night before you go to bed so that you aren’t rushing around looking for your assignments in the morning.

, If you’re caught with something you shouldn’t have at school you are going to get in a lot of trouble. Leave banned items at home, or don’t buy them in the first place.

Never bring drugs, alcohol, or weapons to school. You can get expelled as well as get in trouble with the police, so it’s not at all worth it.

, Be respectful to your teachers as well as your peers. Don’t talk back to a teacher, just listen to them and understand that they are trying to help you. Avoid calling your classmates names, teasing them, or spreading gossip and rumors., You should admit when you have done something wrong, and tell the truth rather than lying. Not only are you likely to be caught in a lie, but then your teachers and parents won’t trust you moving forward. Own up to your mistakes and find a way to fix them.Never, ever cheat. You won’t learn what you are supposed to, and you’ll get in a ton of trouble when you get caught.

, Many kids get in trouble for using curse words or speaking inappropriately. Avoid talking like that at school or in front of teachers and parents. Think of other ways to express yourself in a mature manner.

For example, if a teacher assigns a 3-page paper, don’t say “This is BS! What a waste of time.” Instead, keep your thoughts to yourself or say something like “Wow, it’s going to be a long night.”

, Fighting will certainly get you in trouble at school, so you need to avoid it at all costs. If someone tries to pick a fight with you, simply laugh it off or walk away. It can be difficult to control your emotions in the moment, but it’s a far better solution than wailing on someone and getting suspended. If you feel like the situation is getting out of control, talk to a teacher or counselor.


For example, if someone says something rude to you, respond with “Hey, man, that was rude. Don’t talk to me like that.”

, Pay attention to who seems to do well in school and who is constantly getting in trouble. Don’t hang out with the kids that get in trouble, or you will likely get in trouble too. Find classmates who share your interests, and spend time with them.


For instance, if you love comic books, find a few friends who share your passion. You could even start a comic book club.

, Just because your peers think something is a good idea doesn’t mean it actually is. Think the situation through and trust your gut instinct. If you have a feeling you could get into trouble for doing something, don’t do it.

Say your friends want to steal a rival school’s mascot costume. Rather than going along with the plan, say “Nah, I don’t want to get in trouble. I’ll see you guys later,” and walk away. They may tease you about it, but they won’t be laughing when they end up in detention.

, A great way to stay out of trouble is to get involved at school. Join the student council/government or look for other ways to help out. Volunteer to organize a school event, such as a dance or fundraiser. You could also reach out to a coach and see if they could use your help managing a team or club., When you have a lot of free time on your hands, it can be easy to get into trouble. The best thing to do is to stay busy. Join a sports team or a school club so that you have activities after school. You can also get a job, which will keep you busy as well as provide you with some extra cash.For example, join the softball team, the art club, the swim team, or the drama club.
As for jobs, offer to babysit your neighbor’s children, mow lawns in your neighborhood, or apply for work at a local ice cream shop or restaurant.

Even if you are not planning to go to college, a good high school report card will help you to gain a better job. Popularity is not as important as your future.;
, Complete special assignments and hand them in on time. Do extra work, get extra grades.

, If there are any classes you struggle with, use this time to get better at them. If you're bad at any particular subject, study it in depth and consider getting a tutor.

, Set goals and work hard to meet them.

, Keep it natural and easy to maintain during schooling years.


If you must wear makeup, then make sure it's neutral, you want people to respect you instead of laughing at you. If you don't want to wear makeup, then make sure your skin looks healthy, drink lots of water and use moisturizer.







, Plan your hairstyle the night before, keep your clothes washed and pressed and choose the outfit ahead of each day (unless you have to wear a uniform).

, You want teachers to respect you as well, and spending every night in detention won't help your rep.


Get a quality school bag. A shoulder bag is best, but make sure it's allowed and it looks good with the uniform.







, Pay them an honest compliment, when you talk to them. Show them you are sincere and interested in becoming friends. Do not talk about others, do not gossip, but be helpful to others if you see they need it.

, How you act in high school, is also reflected on your high school records. Remember, these records remain with you forever, and could be the difference between becoming highly successful, or failing.

, Avoid the shallow group of girls people think are really ""cool"". You can't trust them because they are constantly spreading rumours and trying to steal your place. Being the ""Queen Bee"" is not as fun as people think, and once you're one of the shallow girls there is no way out because you would have already insulted all other potential friends. So don't do it!


Don't be rude to the shallow girls. You may hate them, but they are powerful. Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Always be friendly, it will make people respect you, but never be too friendly with the geeks or the shallow girls, for example never spend extra time with them out of school or people will think your one of them. Tell them your busy, it will make you seem mysterious and like you have far more important things to do... even if you don't.







, People need a reason to admire you, so find something that will make you special. For example, I love acting so I always show off in class presentations and drama class. You can have any talent, just find something your good at and practice.


Enter competitions for your talent. If you win a competition then the school is likely to find out and everyone will be really impressed. Film competitions are really fun and definitely my favorite.

Practice good manners.,
Be equally as nice to those that might not be as nice to you.,
Use positive body language to help you communicate better.,
Demonstrate small acts of kindness.,
Plan specific days to show gratitude.,
Appreciate your parents too.",How to Be a Good Class President1," Whether it is your best friend, your classmate, a teacher, a janitor, or any other school worker, everyone should be treated nicely. Because you are the class president, you have to set an example on how to interact with people so that everyone else will do the same. Let others speak before you speak. Interrupting someone when they haven’t finished their thought is extremely rude and shows disrespect to the other person. If it happens by accident, apologize for the incident and let them continue so they can finish what they were saying.
Stop what you’re doing and acknowledge whoever addresses you right away. Don’t keep people waiting to try to get your attention, address them quickly so they can see that you want to listen to what they have to say. If you wait too long to address them, they might think you don’t have time to listen to them.;
, This might sound difficult to do because your instinct might be to be mean back. You are showing great maturity and setting an example to anyone that sees you interact in a positive manner even if you struggle to do it., When interacting with your fellow classmates, positive body language can help you show that you care without having to verbally say it. There are several simple actions that you can do in different situations.


Make eye contact when speaking to others. Whether it is at the podium during a speech, or when you are having a conversation by the lockers, eye contact is important. It establishes a connection of understanding between people as well as emphasizes what is being said.
Smile genuinely when greeting others or when having a casual conversation. A smile sets a relaxed tone and will make people feel at ease around you.
Walk with purpose when getting from one place to another. Don’t slouch and walk with your back straight. By doing this you are showing that you take your responsibilities as class president seriously and that you are ready to take on any challenge that arises.

, It is as important as being respectful. Showing kindness does not have to be anything extravagant. Even the smallest gesture of kindness makes a difference.


Greet people when you pass by them in the hallways. Saying ‘Good Morning’ or ‘Good Afternoon’ is a great way to establish a positive connection with people. Greetings can also really make a difference in people’s days if they are not going too well.
Open the door for others when there are people walking behind you.This small gesture shows good manners and is very appreciated.
Help students carry their belongings if they have too much stuff on their hands. By doing this you are preventing any possible disaster of students tripping, papers falling everywhere, or projects breaking.
Show appreciation to cafeteria workers by saying ‘thank you’. It is so easy to forget to do this when you're busy talking to your friends, but doing this is important so everyone else can say it as well.

, School faculty, staff, and volunteers do a lot for students. Unfortunately, more often than not, their effort is not appreciated enough. Take the initiative to show appreciation through different activities where many students can get involved.


Get students to assist you in writing thank you letters to all faculty and staff. Writing thank you letters is a great way to involve a lot of your classmates and teachers will appreciate getting unique letters from different students.
Help organize a potluck for faculty and staff where the students brings all the food. A potluck can be a great bonding experience between teachers and students.
Pick a day to have sweets and treats delivered to teachers in their classrooms. Designating students to deliver sweets such as cookies or chocolate to teachers after a long day of lessons is sure to bring a smile to these hard working instructors.

, Everyone’s parents do so much to get them to school prepared and ready to learn. There are several ways that you can help students show gratitude to their parents for everything they do for their children.


Set up a station during lunch time with arts and crafts for students to use in order to create unique letters to give to their parents when they get home. Doing this will help students get creative and will allow them to have fun while showing gratitude.
Suggest to the music department that creating a song specifically for saying thank you to your parents would be a good idea. The song could be showcased by the student choir, during a talent showcase, or individual students could learn it and sing it to their parents in the comfort of their home.

Make sure you check these requirements well ahead of launching your campaign. Start by checking in with the student council faculty advisor, who will know what these requirements are., Once you know you’re eligible, spend some time thinking about why you’d make a good student council Vice President. Do you have a firm position about cafeteria food? The number of school dances every year? Thinking about this ahead of time will help you when it comes time to planning your campaign., Your campaign will be the most successful if you can demonstrate that it’s focused on the same things your classmates care about. Promising free ice cream every Wednesday sounds like a good idea, but might not be a priority for the rest of your class.


Put out a survey. A good way to find out what your classmates want is to give them a survey to fill out. You can make it open-ended, with questions like ""What improvement do you most want to see in our school?"" or more specific, by asking them to choose from a variety of options.
Talk to other students. You can also speak to your classmates in person about what they want to see happen in your school. Try starting with your friends. You can say something like ""I really want to run for student council Vice President, but to be a good one, I need to know what everyone wants from their VP. What do you want to see your VP do? What would you like to change about the school?"", Use the information you get from your classmates to create a platform. This means deciding what you want to do as Vice President. Maybe your classmates worry about eating too much junk food. Part of your platform could be increasing the healthy options in the cafeteria. The more your platform corresponds to what your classmates have said, the better., You need to have a plan to make your platform a reality or else your classmates will think you're just full of hot air! If your platform includes stocking the cafeteria with healthier foods, you might plan to meet with the school nurse to identify healthier options, and then with the principal to propose and implement these changes., You can't share your platform and plans on one poster, which is why a campaign slogan is so important. It should reflect why you’re running and what you believe in. Remember, it might be the only thing your classmates hear about you, so you want it to be good.Your campaign slogan can be funny or serious, but it should be simple. Something like ""Jane Seymour for Vice President"" will work. So will something like ""The most interesting man in the world doesn't vote for student council often. But when he does, he votes for Jane!"", You can’t make and hang posters, pass out flyers, and talk to other students all by yourself. Ask a few friends if they’re willing to help you campaign! You can say something like ""I really want to run for student council Vice President, but I won't be able to do it alone. Would you be willing to help me with my campaign?"" Or you can ask for more specific help like ""Would you be willing to help me hang my campaign posters?"", If you’ve put the effort into running for vice president, you don’t want to just hope that someone will vote for you. There are a lot of ways to get the word out that you’re running and whyMake posters. Your posters can be as simple or as flashy as you like. It might help to see what others are doing and then do the opposite – if everyone is making bright, bold, flashy posters, make a simpler but still easily noticeable poster. If everyone else is going plain, go bright! This will help you stand out.
Make a handout. Your classmates will be seeing a lot of posters during the campaign, so consider making a small handout to give to them, too. This should have your name, your slogan, and why you’re running. But make sure your school allows these first – some schools only allow posters!

, The most important part of your campaign will come when you’re asked to give a speech in front of your class or school, describing why they should vote for you. There are a few tips for writing a winning speech that you should follow!


Start by introducing yourself! You can say “Hi! My name is Jane and I’m running for Student Council Vice President!” Not everyone knows who you are, so introducing yourself is a good first step, and keeping it simple will help them remember you.
Tell them why you’re qualified to be Vice President. This is why thinking about these things ahead of time is helpful! You need to tell your class/school what will make you a good Vice President. You can say something like, “I’m a junior so I have experience knowing what the school needs” or “I’ve served as Student Council Secretary so I already know how it works!”
Explain your platform and how you plan to execute it. This should be short and to the point: list the main thing you want to address and how you plan to address it. You can leave a lot of the detail to your handouts and conversations you have with your classmates.
End with your slogan. Ending your speech with your slogan helps your classmates link the posters they see in the hallway to you and your plans., When you give your speech, make sure you deliver it in such a way that makes it easy to follow and leaves an impression. Your speech shouldn't be too long - only 2 to 3 minutes at most. Short and sweet is best!

, It’s a big day, but freaking out or having a meltdown won’t inspire confidence in the classmates who are voting for you. Stay calm – don’t yell at people to vote for you, don’t question people about who they voted for, and don’t panic and say nasty things about your opponents., This bears repeating because it’s as important when you give your speech as it is when people vote for you! Wear something nice to school on election day. A lot of people won’t decide until the last minute who they’re voting for, and seeing you already looking the part can change their minds!


You don’t have to wear something super formal, but you should at least look professional. Try wearing a jacket and some nice pants. Your hair should look neat. It might not be fair, but we all get judged by our appearance. If you look like you take your campaign seriously, other people will take you seriously, too., Shake hands with people as they vote. Smile at them in the hallways. People will vote for someone who is nice to them before they’ll vote for the school bully.

, If you are elected, there are a few things you should do immediately after the election before you get to work as VP!


Thank your volunteers. Make sure you say thank you to everyone who helped with your campaign. You can do this in person or you can write thank you notes. Or you can do both!
Remove campaign material. Take down your posters and clean up any of your handouts that might still be lying around. This is especially important if your school has rules about when this needs to be accomplished.
Congratulate your opponents. Whether you win or not, you should thank the people you ran against. This will help you maintain a good reputation if you decide to run again for another position or if you run for reelection in the same position. And it’s also good manners!, The VP's responsibilities vary from school to school, but you will likely be responsible for running student council meetings in the President's absence. You might also be in charge of specific committees. Make sure you're going to all of the meetings and checking in with the President!

, You ran on specific promises to your classmates. You can ask to add items to student council meeting agendas that focus on the issues in your platform. You can also speak up during meetings to make sure your voice is heard on all issues.

, Don't ignore your classmates once you get elected! Check in with them regularly to make sure they're happy with what the student council, and you in particular, are doing. You can do this in face-to-face conversations by simply asking ""What do you think of the job we're/I'm doing?"" Or you can issue new surveys that ask the same thing.

Talk to all of your classmates at least once.,
Remember the names of the people you talk to.,
Put together fun events outside of school.",How to Be a Good Class President2," Depending on your school and class size, this could prove to be a difficult task. But meeting as many people that you are representing as class president is important! Spend your time wisely during the day so you can meet different people during different activities.Start up a conversation with someone between classes. Even if you just stop by someone’s locker to ask how their day is going, it will help students understand that you are a friendly person.
Sit with someone new each day during lunch time. Look around the cafeteria to see if anyone is sitting alone and join them for lunch. This is your chance to approach students that are loners and get to know what kind of issues they want you to deal with.
Partner up with different classmates for projects in class. It is easy to stick with your friend for projects, but pairing up with different people can be rewarding because you will get to know them better while working together.

, Making sure you know your classmates on a name basis is essential of a good class president.Students will connect with you better if you honestly know who they are, and you don’t just pretend to care.


Introduce yourself when you see classmates you have not met yet.
Ask for students’ names and repeat it to them to make sure you’re saying it right.
Acknowledge people you’ve already met on different occasions by addressing them by name.
Recall parts of past conversations so classmates can see you pay attention to them.

, The effort that you put in getting to know your classmates in school is as important as getting to know them outside of school. It is easier for classmates to open up to you if you have fun with them away from the classroom.


Plan gatherings at the mall to shop together. There are so many stores and activities at a mall, so it is the perfect place to interact with your fellow classmates and learn more about them in a casual setting.
Get together to watch movies at the movie theatre as a large group.There won’t be much talking done during the movie, but the discussion after will help everyone get familiar with each other. This will open up the way for more serious dialogue at school in the future.
Organize a day in the park with everyone to play outdoors. You can play different games or even enjoy a picnic together. The perfect setting for relaxed conversation.

Help defend students that are being bullied.,
Plan activities to help end bullying.,
Find out what issues students care about.",How to Be a Good Class President3," If you see a student getting bullied or hurt, help them out. As a leader, it is your responsibility to help defend students that cannot defend themselves. There are several ways to handle difficult situations between students.Separate the students immediately and ask if everyone is ok. By calming everyone down and diffusing the situation, students will be able to relax and explain what exactly happened.
Ask a teacher or staff for assistance if the situation is too big to handle on your own. Sometimes having an adult present is the only way that students will behave, so asking for help should always come to mind in difficult situations.
Encourage students to report any injustices to you or to school officials. If someone tells you about a specific situation, let a school counselor know so they can approach the student professionally.

, Students should feel safe in school, and you can do a lot to make your school a better environment for everyone. You have to remember that this isn’t a job just for you, but with school faculty as well. Suggest to have hall monitors to supervise students between classes. Hall monitors can help make sure that everything is running smoothly while everyone is going to class. In case there is a problem, a hall monitor can address it or let an instructor know about the issue.
Help post anti-bullying posters around the school. By doing this, students will be aware of how they act and treat each other. Putting reminders for everyone will see can help reduce bullying.
Come up with workshops or seminars to help students speak up if they are being bullied.

, Knowing what kind of problems your classmates have at school is important, especially students that are shy or do not like to speak up. Many students do not want to openly admit they have problems. It is your job to try and identify these issues.


Let students know that you are available to talk with them whenever they need to.
Tell students your locker number so they can leave anonymous notes with the issues that bother them. You will still receive the messages you need to see, but students will be able to avoid the confrontation that they might not want to face.
Guide students who are actively voicing their issues to help others students voice their own problems as well.

"
"
Make your classmates’ ideas the priority.,
Be open to feedback about your leadership.,
Relieve stress easily with the help of others.",How to Be a Good Class President4," You will have ideas of your own that you might want to see in action, but you have to take your classmates’ ideas into equal consideration. Take the time to ask people what kind of issues they want you to work on and then try your best to address them.


Conduct periodic meetings where students can ask you questions or tell you what is important to them.
Actively seek out suggestions from both students that you interact with daily and others that you don’t see often.
Come up with different ideas to address the issues that students want resolved.
Seek students’ assistance to work with you in helping reach class goals together.

, You won’t be doing everything right as class president, and that is ok! But you need to seek constructive criticism so you can understand what you are doing right and what you are doing wrong. Doing this will help you develop into a stronger leader. Ask teachers to evaluate your leading method to see if there is anything you need to change.
Hand out “comments” cards to students so they can let you know what area you need to improve on as their class leader.
Create a “pros and cons” with fellow classmates after school for your leadership style.
Pinpoint your strengths on your own and try to apply that to areas where you believe you need improvement.

, Not everything will be easy to handle as class president. Some days will be harder than others because things will not go as smooth. Understand that nobody is perfect and that trying your best is what matters the most.


Take an hour of your day for yourself without having to worry about anything related to your position as class president if there are several issues you are trying to handle.
Divide the responsibilities you have with the rest of the student council so that you do not have an excessive load of things to do.
Remember that you can ask for help at any point to make things easier. Your classmates, teachers, and parents are more than willing to assist you in organizing workshops, planning school dances, running fundraisers, or completing any other activity for the benefit of your class.

Determine why are you getting tardies.,
Take responsibility for your sleep schedule.,
Organize school supplies.,
Prepare for the next day the day before.,
Plan time realistically.,
Hang around prompt people.,
Don't socialize.",How to Stop Getting Anymore Tardies," Are you disorganized in the morning? Do you tend to want to talk one more minute with friends in the morning before school? Do you underestimate how long it takes to come to school? If you can figure out where you're going wrong, you can fix it.;
, Go to bed on time. Most children, teens and young adults need at least 8-10 hours sleep; if you don't get enough, it will be difficult to be alert in the morning. Get an alarm clock.

, Figure out what you need, and have a place for everything. Know where everything is. You won't waste time searching for your homework if you always put it your backpack when you are done.

, What takes 15 minutes the night before can save you a lot of time in the morning. Pick out your clothes. Make sure that you have everything you need for the day in your backpack/bag.

, How long does it typically take you to get prepared, and/or travel to school? Just because it once took you 10 minutes to get ready for school one time, doesn't mean that's how long it usually really takes. Over a week, time how long it takes to get ready for school, or bike to class, or whatever. This will give you a more realistic time frame.

, If you have classmates who tend to make you late, wait until later in the day to socialize with them. Classmates who arrive on time can be a reminder that you need to get going to class.

, Not until free period, lunch, or the end of school, anyway. If your friends ask, then tell them that you can't afford to get anymore tardies. If they are your real friends, they should understand.

Find a cause.,
Identify the strengths of your argument and the weaknesses of the rule.,
Find support among classmates.,
Determine your 'battle plan'.,
Follow through.",How to Protest a School Rule," You need to feel passionate about what you protest against. Most of the times, school administrators implement a new rule that students find ridiculous: This can be an opportunity to spark something. If a fight-worthy cause comes up, make sure to act when it is new and when people are not used to it. Go through the official rulebook of the school to find out exactly what the rule is: Find out exactly how it is supposed to be enforced as well. Look at the rhetoric. If the rule is older, do a bit of research about what the rules generally were. Then, think about it: Is this worth protesting? Will it really make a difference to you and the student body, or do you just want to oppose the school?


Review the rules in your school handbook. Many are old, outdated, or may seem ridiculous. If they are enforced at outdated, this is an ideal way to abolish that rule.
Listen to teachers. They know what's going on in the school, and they will talk about the latest gossip, often including a rule or idea that they disagree with.;
, This is very similar to writing a persuasive essay: You need to find why the rule should not exist. Find its disadvantages, its weak points, and why you disagree. Talk with classmates and teachers about why they disagree or agree. There may (probably will) be several reasons. List and compile all of these reasons why this rule is not optimal. Then, find the advantages of not having that rule: Talk to anyone that you see about how life in school will improve without this rule. Remember to list and save these reasons as well! Put everything together and find the strongest arguments.


How will the school change for the better? Why will the school be better off without it? Will it better the society, the student body, the teachers, and/or the classes?

, If your opinion is a popular one, then this is simply a matter of spreading the word. Distribute flyers, tape things up around the school, ask teachers if you can make a thirty-second presentation at the beginning of class. One of the best ways to spread the word is by word of mouth: Tell all of your friends, or send out a mass email: Then tell them to do the same! You can ask teachers to tell students about your movement. Some school systems have announcements and intercoms: ask if you can take a moment to make a quick announcement. If you can get the attention of the cafeteria (stand on a table and shout for a minute) you can spread the word to over a hundred students at a time.


This will be much harder to do if your opinion is an unpopular one. If you have an assignment to give a speech, consider giving it on your opinion. Be aware that because you will be unlikely to attain a majority, it will be very hard to change the rule.

, The most common, and most effective, methods of doing this are staging a protest and forming a petition.


If you stage a protest, you might need to have a permit, depending on where you stage it. You will need to set a time, date, and place at least a week away. Put up flyers, tell everybody, make an announcement: Do whatever you need to do to get followers. Hold a poster-making session to create some spirit. Make sure that people understand that this will be a peaceful protest.

If you start a petition, make sure that it has a place for name, grade, and signature. At the top of every page type I oppose the requirement that ""insert reason here"". Print out multiple copies, hand them out to your friends, and take them to all of your classes. If you have after school or extracurricular activities with friends, take it to those activities to have them sign! Make sure that all signatures are in pen, and make sure that nobody signs twice for legal reasons.

, Present the petition or results of the protest. Set up a meeting with the principal or school board: Mention your cause, your argument, and stress how many people showed up. If you had at least 20% of the school, chances are excellent that you will succeed. If they do take public opinion into consideration, realize that they may not eliminate the rule in its entirety: They might adapt it, or not change it at all. We have the right to petition and peaceful protest, but they have the right to ignore us. Be proud of your self whether or not you succeed: You have made a difference.

, There's a very good chance that the students in the class you asked got something wrong. Teachers also give great tips on how to streamline the process of getting back on track. This works especially well if the teacher likes you, they may give you more time for the assignment.

, Do you like smooth gentle music? Or maybe does metal keep you up? Or will you study faster with silence? Whatever it is, use it.

, This helps avoid distractions. But also make sure your room is light enough so you do not get too sleepy!

For papers - everybody wants to be able to just write it and pass it in.",How to Coast Through School Easily," You can try pleading with them, but mostly, you should have friends who are willing to help. Copy their work as needed, but also study class notes to make sure you understand the material. Otherwise, you'll be in trouble come test time.;
, For example, if you have Algebra homework, don't whip out the huge textbook during English. But, if you have something like Algebra and you need to do some English, you can take out the small book you're reading and read it behind the person who sits in front of you. Just position the book so that the teacher can't see. It's not really that hard. If you sit in a closer row to the teacher, flatten out the book a little and put it under the notebook you're supposed to be writing in.

, Get them from a friend. If the notes are easy though, and it's not a lecture where you're just writing down what the teacher is blabbing on about, you could probably take the notes with no problem.

, Do it at lunch (after you eat), during homeroom (if you have it), or stay after school for a short time. For a change of pace, actually study in study hall!

, If you have to fill out a worksheet, for example, and you know the teacher doesn't read over the whole thing (most don't), your answers don't have to be perfect.

, The assigned books in high school are usually a decent read, but you may need that boost every now and then. CliffsNotes (available at most bookstores) are also good to get you over the hump.

, Don't waste time with minutiae. For example, if you have a problem in math, and for some reason can't get the answer to some problem, don't get someone to tell you the answer. Try to understand the concept and then you'll be able to do all those types of problems. Same thing for other classes - Don't memorize events of whatever book you're reading for English, merely know the themes and the characters.

, If you learn in class, you don't have to waste time on schoolwork outside of school. The teachers are teachers for reasons - they're probably better than your friends at explaining things. You're stuck in the room, at least make some use of the time.

, If writing just doesn't come naturally to you, you might not be able to just sit down, crank it out, and print it out. But there are ways to expedite the process. First, instead of just trying to write a paper line by line, think about your topic and just make up an impromptu little speech and try to make sure it flows well and transitions between ideas. Then, translate that into a paper by adding the appropriate details and analysis, keeping the smoothness of the speech. Another helpful technique that saves time is making an outline. Just get all your ideas on a paper in order and you won't get stuck while writing, and you can be at your most productive. As for proofreading, you can avoid this if you get in the habit of writing in the same tense consistently and then just spellcheck. General typing skills help also. And although this may go against the spirit of this wiki-how page, it is recommend that you know something about whatever topic you're writing about. Having the information in your brain ready to go facilitates writing greatly.

Hand work in on time.",How to Be Responsible and Have Good Grades," If you are organized you won't lose things, you won't panic and you won't give up easily. Being well organized will also show your teacher that you care.;
, There are lots of ways, including color coding, dating items, using different folders, filing items, etc. Ask your parents or teacher for ideas if you're stumped; or do a search online for good organizational tips for study or personal life.


Apps can help you stay organized, if you like that sort of thing. There are to-do lists, file sharers, time keepers, diaries, and much more, all in app form. Look in the ""Productivity"" sections of the apps stores.

, Stop thinking about yourself all of the time and learn to think about others; volunteering will give you the means to achieve this. Select a charity or cause you care about and get involved. Even an hour a week can be a way to connect with the community and give of yourself. In the process, you'll learn a lot about being responsible.

, If you're not old enough to have a job just do something to help the community. Maybe walk dogs, babysit, make a lemonade stand, wash cars, and other basic but useful services. Put the money into a savings account to start building a decent funds base for yourself and your future.

, When you say you will do something do it right then and there. This isn't just about your studies; it's also applicable to chores, promises, punctuality and getting back to people.

, Just tell yourself that you are responsible, then live up to that self-set standard. Do not worry about what others say or think, they're not you and they haven't a clue what goes on inside of your head; once you've made a determination to change, get on with it regardless of others' opinions.

, This is where the responsibility comes in. Make sure you check over your homework. Also make sure you use your notes. As much as possible, be neat; those marking your work appreciate not having to decipher things on top of having to comprehend your gist or workings out.

, If you are not sure how to do something, just ask. If you don't ask, they'll assume you either know or can't be bothered to know; it's hard for a teacher to crack that nut either way, so stop causing them to try. Remind yourself that there is no such thing as a dumb question; many people in class are often wondering the same thing and lack the courage to ask––be the hero and do the asking anyway.

, If you have good notes and you study you will improve your marks in time. Studying isn't just about sitting there staring at the page and parroting the author's information though. Study involves really breaking down the material before you and understanding it properly. Only you can find the way to make this work best but there is help if you need it; talk to the teacher, a counselor, your parents, etc., if you feel you need help with learning disabilities or you want extra tuition. Don't suffer in silence; it's too important to let slide.

, If you aren't paying attention in class you won't know what to do when you have a pop quiz. As an added bonus––the more you listen in class, the less work you need to do outside of it because you've already absorbed relevant information. With this head start, you can leap ahead and learn more than what class taught you, expanding your mind and knowledge quickly.

, Playing around with deadlines is the result of kidding yourself or playing games with the teacher (and yourself). At the end of the day, while the teacher has a role of encouraging you, it is not the teacher who needs to get good grades––he or she already has employment. It's you who needs to get the good grades. Look ahead to deadlines, count back and start working on the items early. That way––no panic, a job well done and early hand in (which means it's off your plate). Good for you.

Try to recall anyone else that committed the same offense.,
See the big picture.",How to Not Worry when You're in Trouble at School1," If you’ve done something small like forgetting your pencil in class or getting caught with a snack, you have little to worry about. Simply do as your teacher asks to fix the problem and then move on. There is no need to fixate on the problem and make yourself worried and distracted from the rest of the class.For example, you might tell yourself something like “Everyone makes mistakes. I’ll do better next time.”
Keep in mind that repeatedly doing small things might lead you to be in more trouble than if you just do it once. If you continue to worry, you’ll be distracted and more likely to get into trouble again.;
, You might feel like you can lie your way out of the situation, but that rarely works. You are far better off to own up to your actions and accept responsibility. This way, your teachers are more likely to think that you are taking the situation seriously and will respect you more.

, You may have gotten caught breaking a rule, and now your mind has gone straight to the worst possible scenario. Instead, think about anyone else in the school that has done something similar. Try to remember what their punishment was like, or if they had one at all. This will be a good indicator as to what kind of trouble you are in., Even if you get in trouble a time or two, your life isn’t over. Avoid the urge to create a doomsday scenario in your mind. You will still be able to graduate, have a good career, and lead a happy life.

Ask about expectations for yourself and your child, including details about homework and school involvement.Take an active role in your child’s transfer process. A mid-year transfer can be stressful for everyone, including your child’s teachers, so make sure you are aware of all of the requirements involved.;
, Curriculums often vary by state, or even by school district. Learn whether you or your child will be right on target with coursework, or ahead or behind. If your child’s new school has a curriculum more advanced or further behind your child’s current curriculum, work with your child’s new teachers to make sure your child is up to speed.You can request coursework from your child’s new teachers, and go over this coursework with your child so they know what to expect from a new school and classroom.
A tutor may be necessary for the first few months if your child’s current curriculum is behind the new curriculum. If this is the case, talk with your child about tutoring beforehand and explain why it is necessary.

, Get a feel for the school’s reputation and strengths and weaknesses by talking to parents familiar with the school’s ins and outs. Educators are likely going to focus primarily on the school’s academic habits and accomplishments, and might not be as aware of the school’s social dynamics.


You can request to contact the PTA through the school office, or, if distance permits, you can go directly to the school, explain your situation, and approach some of the parents you see dropping off or picking up their children.
Have questions prepared prior to talking to parents. In the particulars of introducing yourself to someone new, you might accidentally forget a few important points to touch on. You might ask how their children like the school, if they have experienced any troubles with any faculty or staff, if homework and testing are rigorous--ask questions to get a better idea of what your child should expect.

, Some schools require a lot of paperwork to be processed before a transfer is complete. Begin the transfer process as early as two months before your intended move, if possible.Begin by explaining your intent with your child’s teacher or teachers. Ask them how you can help make the transition a smooth one.
Visit your current school and new school’s offices (or call, if the distance is too great). Determine exactly what needs to be done prior to transferring, and how you can help it go quickly and easily.

, Whether you are all moving across the state, or your child is moving to another school in the same city, plan your move and every aspect of moving that might impact schooling. This might include completing homework ahead of time, finishing up a unit at your existing school to get a concrete grade to transfer, or saying goodbye to the friends and faculty at your current school.Take some time to thank any teachers or faculty members who have had a significant impact on your child’s life.

, Most schools will require a minimum of proof of address, transcripts, and vaccine records. Some may require report cards, letters from teachers, and evidence of a move. Find out what the new school requires early on, and gather the necessary paperwork, keeping it in an easily-accessible area.A binder or file folder will be sufficient to keep all papers intact. If you have multiple children, or multiple schools, divide the paperwork accordingly, and carefully label each storage container.

, Most school districts require a record of immunizations, and many will not accept a child who is not up to date on their vaccines.These are not difficult to obtain, fortunately, and typically only require a quick call or visit to your child’s pediatrician or your family practice physician.


If your child has been diagnosed with a disability of any kind, you may be required to provide additional medical information, such as medicine and dosage information, diagnosis information, etc.
If your child suffers any particularly volatile illness such as epilepsy, make sure you let your child’s new school know. In such cases, it is best to give your child and the school a small card with emergency contact information.

, To demonstrate where your child is grade-wise and curriculum-wise, you must present your child’s new school with transcripts. These can be delivered directly to the new school, or you can deliver these yourself.


If possible, wait to move schools until your child has completed a semester or quarter; transcripts are much easier to provide if a grading period has ended and grades have been distributed. Although it is not impossible to create transcripts in the middle of a semester or quarter, it will require additional notes and may be an added obstacle in your child’s new school.
Find out if your child’s new school requires transcripts to be sealed. Some schools require transcripts to be delivered in sealed envelopes directly from the institution they originated from. Although this is not common in elementary, middle, and high school, it can be a frustrating obstacle to encounter.

, Public schools usually have specific zones drawn, detailing which children attend which school. For this reason, schools will require you to not only provide your home address, but also a proof of address.Utility bills are usually accepted forms of proof of address. These might be difficult to come by your first month of living in a new place, but you may be able to request a “proof of service” letter from your utility companies.
If you have purchased a new home, your home deed’s title page should be enough to verify your address. To keep this important document safe, it is best to make a copy to deliver to your child’s school.
Bank statements are often acceptable address proof forms, though some establishments might not be willing to accept these. Contact the school office to ensure this is an acceptable form of address proof.

, If your child is 16 or older, make copies of their driver license to provide to the school’s office. A younger child will not have a driver license, but most states allow children to have verified ID cards under 16. Obtaining an ID is a simple way to establish your child’s identity with the new school office.Middle schools and high schools use school IDs in most areas. These will be acceptable forms of identification, if they are available.

, It is not uncommon for school offices to have mix-ups regarding paperwork. To be safe, request copies of all of your child’s transfer paperwork and information, and have them with you when you visit the new school for the first time. If a mishap has occurred, you will not have to postpone your child’s first day.


These forms are also good to have on hand to get an idea of where your child is in their curriculum. If teachers or other faculty members have questions, you can refer them to your child’s transcripts directly.

, If your child’s school uses student IDs, schedule your child’s ID portrait as soon as possible--preferably on or before their first day of school. IDs may be used to verify a student’s identity, to allow access to the school, or to purchase school lunches, so getting this task completed early on is a definite must.

, Your child may feel frustrated or angry at the sudden change in schools and social circles. Create an open line of communication between your child (or children) and yourself, making it clear that emotions are not off limits.


Discuss how the first day at a new school may look when transferring in the middle of the year.Talk about how children might react to new students, how to talk to the teachers if you need help, etc.
Offer to escort your child to their new classroom or homeroom. Although many children will decline, some may need the added boost of confidence having a parent present provides.

, Extracurricular activities will vary from school to school, both in terms of offerings and in terms of timing. Getting your child involved in extracurriculars they enjoy is an excellent way to help them find friends with similar interests.


Acquaint yourself with elective courses, as well as after-school activities, and go over them with your child or children, helping them choose which to enroll in.
Start slow. Your child may have a wide range of interests, but scheduling too many activities may overwhelm your child, particularly in the wake of a move. Start with 1-2 activities, and build from there., Children may feel too embarrassed to mention falling behind in class, or struggling to perform in gym or sports. Keep in contact with your child’s teachers and coaches, checking in once per month to make sure everything is going well in the classroom.Keep these interactions friendly. You might feel defensive if your child begins to struggle, but you need teachers and coaches to be your allies.

, Although your child’s school has changed, home routines don’t need to. Continue to provide breakfast and dinner at the same time, if possible, and continue any weekly traditions (think family nights, game nights, and so on) to create a sense of normalcy.If you don’t currently have routines, ask your child or children what types of traditions they might like to start. This will help them have some control over their day-to-day activities and may ease some of the difficulty of moving schools.
If your child moved schools due to a parent’s job change and old routines are no longer possible, try to mimic them as closely as possible. If you can no longer be there for breakfast, for instance, make breakfast before you leave for work and have it ready for your kids., Changing new schools is difficult; children must not only learn a new routine, but have to develop new friendships and acclimate to new teaching methods. It may take a couple of months for your child to be as well-adjusted as they were in their previous school. If this is the case, try not to worry too much, as your child is likely going to be just fine.If you notice your child has still not been able to assimilate within a reasonable time frame (4-8 weeks), calmly discuss with your child any ways you can help make the transition easier.

Apologize for getting into trouble.,
Offer to correct the mistake.,
Accept the punishment.",How to Not Worry when You're in Trouble at School2," The first step to getting out of trouble is to acknowledge you did something wrong. Apologize to the teacher or other disciplinarian for what you have done. This will go a long way toward easing the consequences.For example, you might say to your teacher “I’m sorry that I fell asleep in class today. It won’t happen again.”

, Apologizing is a good first step, but it does not correct your mistake. Offer a suggestion as to how you could fix the situation. Be ready for your teacher to change your idea a bit. If you are willing to compromise, you might be able to move past the incident without getting into much trouble.Given the example of falling asleep in class, you could suggest to your teacher that you will get to bed earlier so that you aren’t so tired.

, Whether you are truly sorry or not, you might still have to face consequences. As long as these consequences are fair and within reason, accept them without complaint. This will show that you do truly want to fix the situation.Do not be combative, even if you feel the consequences are much too severe for your actions. If you feel that you were treated unjustly, talk to your parents or the school counselor/principal.

Realize that there are consequences for breaking rules.,
Make an effort to do your work.,
Follow school policies.,
Get along with other students.",How to Not Worry when You're in Trouble at School3," It is no secret to you that your school has a lot of rules. Whether you agree with them or not, they are still expected to be followed. Before doing something that could get you into trouble, think through the situation and decide if the risk is worth the consequences if you get caught., A common complaint amongst teachers is that students do not attempt to do their work. This leads to a defiant and ineffective classroom and a frustrated teacher. If you want to stay on the teacher’s good side, complete all of your assignments on time and turn them in.For example, if you have a book report due, get it done on time (or early) instead of asking to turn it in late.

, All schools have policies in place. Common ones include things like tobacco bans, bans on weapons, dress codes, or attendance policies. These policies must be followed by each and every student. If you fail to follow these polices, you will get into trouble.For example, if you bring alcohol onto school grounds, you will certainly get in trouble.

, Conflict with other students can lead to trouble. Whether it escalates to a physical fight or simply causes class disruptions, these conflicts are not amusing for your teachers. If you make an effort to get along with your fellow students, you can avoid these conflicts entirely."

Know your rights regarding protest.",How to Protest Part of Your School's Student Code," Before staging a protest, you should carefully review your school’s dress code policy. If the policy is not online or in a student handbook, you should request a copy from a school administrator. In order to have a successful protest, you must fully understand the policy and how it infringes on your rights. When reviewing the policy, consider the following:


What clothes are deemed acceptable and unacceptable?
Who makes the determination as to whether clothing is unacceptable?
Are you required to wear a uniform or just dress in accordance with certain guidelines?
You should note differing requirements for men and women.
If the policy prohibits “disruptive” clothing or clothing that “interferes” with school activities, check whether the policy defines what activity constitutes disruptive or interfering.;
, A successful dress code protest needs to have a reason. Usually it will be based on a view that the dress code is unfair, discriminatory, or even harmful. Decide what it was that first made you upset about the dress code.Many students are demanding changes in dress code policies because they want the policies to reflect changing norms in society. A code that was written 20 or more years ago will make certain assumptions about boys and girls that are not generally true today.
Students are also challenging dress codes because they unfairly burden women and gender nonconforming youth.

, Before launching a formal protest and even after the protest has been initiated, you should request a meeting with your school administrator. By maintaining an open dialogue about students’ concerns, you may educate the administration about changing dress and gender norms and explain why you find the policy discriminatory or offensive.In a meeting, you can present your concerns in a persuasive way and even bring research that backs up your position.
A meeting may allow school administrators to take action on students’ dress code concerns before a protest is conducted.

, Some school administrators and teachers may not realize that the dress code policy is offensive or harmful to certain students. By requesting a meeting with teachers and administrators, you can explain why you find the policy harmful and ask for their help in correcting the problem.


For example, in some schools, administrators may be dealing with gender nonconforming or transgender students for the first time and they may need help in understanding how the policies negatively impact these students., If the school insists on keeping the dress code, you can ask that students be involved in creating a more inclusive dress code. This would allow students to engage in creating a dress code that better represents current clothing norms and gender equity.


By involving students in policy making, students may be more likely to adhere to the dress code since they helped shape the policy., If you are planning to stage a school protest it is helpful to recruit as many fellow students to your cause as possible. One of the easiest ways to gather support is by creating a school petition. By setting forth your reasons for protesting the dress code policy and collecting signatures in support of your protest, you can show school administrators how many students want a change to the dress code policy.


A petition also lets you figure out how many other students will be willing to engage in other forms of protest.
When collecting signatures from your classmates, ask them what other forms of protest they would support.

, Another way that students have been protesting school dress codes is by staging walk outs.On a designated date and time, students leave class and gather at a central meeting location. At the location, students then engage in picketing the school. For some agreed time, students would march on school grounds carrying signs that explained the protest and the change that they want to see.


Be aware that by leaving school without permission, you may suffer a disciplinary response from the school.
If you can get a significant number of students to participate in the walk out, it would show the school that the students have serious concerns over the dress code.

, To protest biased dress code policies, you can write the language of the policy or words that teachers or administrators said to you when explaining why your clothing violated the dress code. If the language used by the school is inflammatory or gender biased, your clothing becomes a protest statement.


For example, after being sent home for a dress code violation, a student wrote the words that her administrator said to her across her shirt and returned to school. The words were, “It doesn't cover your crotch. You'll distract the boys.”, Similar to a walkout, you can prearrange with members of the student body to wear clothing that would violate the dress code as part of a protest. For example, to bring attention to how the dress code affects gender nonconforming students in one school, boys dressed in skirts and dresses for a day and girls dressed in more traditional “boys” clothing., Generally students have broad rights to express their discontent and protest as long as they use off-campus computers to express themselves. You could create a website dedicated to airing complaints that students have about the dress code. The Supreme Court has ruled that students’ critiques of their school on a website is protected speech under the U.S. Constitution.It is important to keep the protest focused on the topic and use appropriate language. If you create a website for comments, you need to monitor it and delete messages that are off the topic or that use offensive language. Any threatening language should not be tolerated either.

, Another way to gain support and protest student dress codes is to post pictures of you wearing clothing that was deemed offensive and in violation of the dress code. If you were sent home for clothing that would seem appropriate to most individuals, you should consider posting a picture of yourself in the “offending” outfit on social media. If your picture and comments about the dress code are shared often enough, the photograph can be used not only to highlight the problems with the dress code but also to help you gain support for other forms of protest.


Some students have even created hashtags such as #IAmMoreThanADistraction to create an online space for other people to discuss humiliating and/or sexist experiences they had with school dress codes., There are a number or websites that allow users to create free online petitions. As students tend to be more tech savvy, it may be easier to create an online petition than to use a more traditional paper petition. When creating a petition, you are generally asked to describe the situation that you are trying to change. Explain all of the reasons why the policy is outdated, discriminatory or not inclusive. Once you have created your petition, you can circulate it via email and through social media. An online petition may allow you to reach many more people than just those who you see at school., Schools have the duty to apply rules that provide students with an effective public school education in a safe and secure setting. To create this school atmosphere, schools are permitted to require a dress code that furthers the mission of the school and prevents violent and abusive behavior.


Schools are generally allowed to have dress codes that ban vulgar or obscene clothing, or clothing that disrupts school activity.
Schools cannot prohibit clothing that censors student expression, particularly when the school doesn’t like the student’s message., Schools run into trouble with dress codes when they act to limit a student’s right to self expression or free speech. The freedom of speech is not unlimited in school settings. Even if a student is engaging in self-expression, the school can limit the student’s right to self-expression if the school believes that the student’s speech or expression would be a substantial disruption of school activities or invade the rights of others.For example, the Supreme Court said that wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam war was protected by the 1st Amendment.
The Supreme Court ruled that giving a lewd, vulgar political speech at a school assembly was not protected speech because it was outweighed by the school’s interest in teaching students appropriate behavior.
Dress codes cannot be used to limit religious freedom, which is also protected by the 1st Amendment. For example, individuals have challenged dress codes based on religious freedom for the following: Muslim girls suspended for wearing a head scarf; codes that banned cross necklaces; bans on traditional dress such as wearing tribal feathers to graduation; and ban on rosaries., You have the right to peacefully protest a dress code policy. However, if you engage in an activity that violates the policy or breaks other school rules, you may be punished according to the student handbook. You cannot be punished more harshly because you violated the school’s dress code or rules during a protest."

Be self-deprecating.",How to Be the Funniest in School," To be the funniest in school, you have to know what your classmates find funny! Listen to them and see what makes them chuckle. Do they lose their cool when you make fun of your teachers? When you make fun of yourself? How about physical comedy? Or do they prefer jokes that make references to TV shows, comedians, and all of pop culture?


And even within your group of friends, different people are going to find different things funny. Try to take note of each of your close friends' tastes. How are they different?
Know how to handle your teachers, too. If you were assigned to write a variation of the famous ""to be or not to be"" speech from Hamlet and you go up and recite the lyrics to ""Should I Stay or Should I Go?"" by the Clash, some teachers may find it hilarious. Others? Not so much.;
, Turns out all humans are kind of the same. There are a few basic premises we have always found and will always find hilarious:



Pain. If you've ever seen even just one cartoon, you know this concept. Think Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner. Garfield. Bugs Bunny. Mickey Mouse. They all do the pain schtick. It's timeless.

The unexpected. It's only when we don't see things coming that they have the potential to be anything -- surprising, scary, funny, you name it. So take any normal circumstance and go somewhere else with it. Cloudy out? Put on sunglasses. No one laughed at your joke? Bust out laughing. Trying to hide? Hide behind a small plant. Be as ridiculous as you feel comfortable!

Wordplay and puns. More on this bit later, but twisting words can be a great way to make people laugh. Talking about WWII in history class? Don't Jewish you were there?

, For most jokes, it's pretty much all that matters. This is something you sort of just have to feel, so we'll skip the wordy explanations. Just be aware of it -- the next time someone else cracks a joke, think about how the timing effected how funny it was.


Think about dead silences. Take the line, ""Who wants the last mozzarella stick?"" Not funny. But when you and your friends are sitting at the lunch table and no one's talking, everyone is totally awkward, and no one has anything to say (cricket, cricket, cricket), and you bust out a nervous, eye-shifty, ""So...who wants the last mozzarella stick?"" while creeping your fingers along the table to eat it yourself.

, This article has covered making fun of yourself -- now it's time to make fun of your friends! In nice ways, though; you want to be their friend after the joke! Find something you can poke light fun at -- something they can laugh at too -- to get the crowd roaring. Maybe they can dish it back!


For example, when your tall, skinny friend walks in the room, ignore them briefly and then say, ""Oh, I'm so sorry! I mistook you for a lightpost."" They obviously know you didn't think they were actually a lightpost. It's clear it's a joke, so they shouldn't have reason to be offended.
Some people aren't great at taking jokes. If you have friends that you know are like this, avoid this tactic with them. Only poke fun at people who you know are okay with it.

, Slapstick comedy has been around for ages and still gets our sides aching. Anything from pulling your friend's chair out from underneath him to falling out of your own chair because someone made such a dumb comment you couldn't take it qualifies. You don't need actual words to be funny!


If you've ever heard of Lucille Ball (one of the most famous comediennes of all time) or the ""I Love Lucy"" show, you might remember that the most popular episodes of this show were where she was learning how to stomp grapes, where she was shoving chocolates in her face, and when she was eating a meat drink. The most timeless comedy is physical.

Dunno who she is? Then think Mr. Bean or Charlie Chaplain! They each have entire bits without words dedicated to the art of physical comedy.



, Puns can be the worst, but a good pun -- or even better, good wordplay -- gets everyone going. The next time your friend talks about his camping trip, say, ""Wow, that sounds in tents!"" Did that same friend crack a chicken-across-the-road joke? Man, that's poultry in motion, isn't it? Get clever!


Need some examples? wikiHow has that, too!


, When people trust that you're the class clown, cracking jokes gets a lot easier. They'll be practically ready to laugh at anything you say -- and you'll have the confidence that you will. So start feeding your funny bone now, busting out jokes left, right, and center. You want to be the person that everyone says, ""Man, they crack me up!""


The only way to do this is keep everything light and funny. So even when you have a terrible test coming up or things are looking a little bleak, be the one ready with a joke to liven up the situation.

, Having the words and the physicality is great, but the look will help too. Make part of your personality eccentric on the outside to match the eccentricities of your jokes! Could you pull off a monocle? Maybe a cape? At least semi-matching socks?


Sometimes your image will help your humor. Imagine your boring Aunt Marge trying to tell jokes. Wouldn't it be a lot funnier if she were wearing shoulder pads and a terrible, terrible hat?

, We're not saying to steal jokes, but it's definitely a good idea to listen to comedians to get a feel for the types of humor and styles out there. And if you happen to repeat a joke that your friends don't know is from someone else, well, no need to mention it! Let them think it's from you.


Go a little outside the biggest names to get away with murder. Try Tig Notaro, Pete Holmes, Jim Norton, or Nick Kroll on for size. And don't just use their jokes -- take their jokes and make them your own!

, Having a handful of jokes at your disposal can take the heat of you having to improve something on the spot. If there's some dead air in the room, you can fill it with a joke you have up your sleeve. Listen to those comedians we just talked about, watch some comedy television, and spend some time online building your armory.


Try not to use them too often. You don't want people to groan every time you start, ""So this Canadian walks into a diner...""

, At the end of the day, you need to be relaxed to get away with your humor. If you're so nervous about people finding you funny (or not finding you funny), that'll be the only thing people see -- your awesome jokes will go totally unnoticed. Be carefree about it -- if you think you're funny, your classmates will fall in line, too.


If they don't laugh, so what? You'll hit 'em next time with a great line. You don't have to be funny 24/7. Comedy is a process of trial and error. Some comedians hone the same joke for years. Give yourself a break!

, Even the best of jokes fall flat if you don't deliver it like you believe it's funny. When you can get behind a line with some well-timed arm flailing or by making a face that is so expressive it almost says the line for you, the joke is that much better. Whatever you're saying, say it with your entire body, too.


Aziz Ansari has a good bit where he talks about trying to meet girls. None of them like him, so he consoles himself by telling them, ""It's okay. My friend Brian likes me."" Not an especially funny line! But he delivers it with gusto and almost anger, pouting, scoffing, and widening his eyes. It's his embodiment of his emotion behind the joke that seals the deal.

, Inside jokes, even if they have you rolling on the floor, will be lost on everyone else. You need to have content that everyone gets and can understand. To make it so the entire room is laughing, use lines with pop culture references. Poke fun at what's going on in the world right now -- that way, everyone is in on the joke.


What do you and your friends pay attention to? Do you have favorite TV shows? Favorite music? Favorite celebrities? Allude to these in your jokes! Bust out Gangnam Style to the beat of your teacher's choral music. Stick out your tongue and purr like a cat when Miley Cyrus comes up on your friend's iPod. Quote you and your friends' favorite TV show when an opportunity arises. Be ready for it!

, One of the most common forms of humor is sarcasm. If it matches your personality, it can be your go-to. It's often dry, biting, a bit absurd, and pokes a little fun at whoever or whatever is the subject of conversation. As long as people know you're being sarcastic and not serious, it can be hilarious!


Sometimes you can use it to mean the opposite of what you actually mean. Think along the lines of ""George Bush was the best president ever"" or ""Wow, that's the best idea you've ever had!"" Or you could use it to say something a bit absurd: ""You like dogs? I like dogs, too. Let's exchange recipes!""
A lot of sarcasm comes in the tone of voice. If you say that George W was the best president with a serious face, acting all offended, people won't know whether you're kidding or not. That method can work too -- just know when you need to drop the act to let them in on your joke.

, Being consistently funny (and you want to be funny all the time, not just once in a while, right?) means you have to stay alert and ready to roll with the punches. Let's say a person you're friends with walks in the room and sits down. Without missing a beat, you turn to everyone else and say, with a furtive glance downward, inching your chair out, ""Do you think he saw us yet?"" Be aware of your environment so you don't miss any opportunities!


Try to take the normal, everyday, mundane stuff and turn them into a punchline. By staying alert and observant, you can do just that. Say your friend is showing you pictures of her on vacation and she says, ""Ugh, I look so fat."" You respond with, ""It's okay; they say the camera adds 10 pounds. How many cameras are on you here?"" Just make sure your friends won't get mad!

, Alright, so enough with the poking fun at others stuff. It's even funnier to poke fun at yourself. No one will be offended and in addition to you being hilarious, you're down-to-earth and modest. Win, win, win.


Need an example? Let's say your best friend just got called on by your teacher. He has no idea what to say, so he goes, ""Umm...I...well...huh...yes?"" You then slip in a, ""God, it's like me trying to talk to girls."" Instead of making fun of him, you turn it onto yourself!

, There's no specific type of studying to do. We all have different minds and they all work in different ways. Studying improves grades. Having good grades is a trait absolutely needed to be close to perfect! Being an obstacle to yourself is an issue most kids have in studying. When you don't wanna do it, but you also do wanna do it, JUST DO IT!

, Find a group of friends that you want to be best friends with and be okay friends or act friendly around other people. Having a wide variety of friends helps a lot. Don't just be friends with on certain type of group, TRY to be friends with everyone.

, Like I said, you need good grades. But you also have to excel in other things like gym and art. Gym is fun and it should be fun, but don't slack off, build the muscle. Don't stop exercising when your coach turns around. Have plenty of laughs but make it your priority to finish gym by doing everything all the way. Exercising with a friend makes it a lot more fun than doing it alone too. Take tips from your coach, try out for a sport too. For art, you need to practice, have your art teacher explain to you how to draw a 3 dimensional pumpkin. Make it a priority to get the project done, colorfully an beautifully.

, Maintain a healthy weight, instead of eating cookies for snack, eat a banana. For lunch, have a sandwich with meat. I encourage you to try out for a sport, because you have to exercise not just eat right. If you're not sure, try out for a sport with a friend. This especially works if you have a friend who is perfect, make it your goal to beat her.

, Brush your teeth. Did you know that brushing your teeth doesn't give you nice breath? Use mouthwash. Get braces if needed. Go to your dentist to see what you need to do.

, Use scented lotion. I suggest a flower scent. Also use germ-x... no you don't have to use disgusting smelling germ-x. There are germ-x scents in mini bottles at Bath and Body Works. Always wash your hands. Keep a small bottle of hand-sanitizer in your purse and a bigger one in your bathroom. Use them to get into the habit of using hand-sanitizer first, then washing them to get off the dead germs. It makes your hand feel, and be, especially clean!

, If you want to, you can paint them a pretty color. If you want to you can keep them clean cut, not dirty, and clear or glitter nail polish should go on the nails. If you are a guy, pick the dirt out, and keep them trimmed.

, If you have a boyfriend, don't cheat on him. If you want to break-up let it down slowly and make sure its okay. Just be nice about it. Don't have a trashy boyfriend. If you are young, I advise you not to have a boyfriend for now. They can be hard to handle with all this stuff.

Every apology should start with the two magic words: ""I'm sorry,"" or ""I apologize."" It's important to give a genuine apology, because these words express remorse about what you did.Be genuine with your apology. If you don't feel bad about your actions, try to view your actions from your teachers perspective. This may help you understand why you got in trouble.
Look your teacher in the eye when you apologize. Don't look at the floor or around the room. Looking your teacher in the eye will show them that you're being genuine.
If your teacher genuinely believes that you are sorry, they may take you out of detention.;
, When you are apologizing to someone, it is usually important to them that you admit your mistakes. Acknowledge that you messed up by saying “I take full responsibility for my actions.”


Describe what happened without placing the blame on others. Trying to place the blame on others makes you look like you're avoiding the blame. If you want your apology to be taken seriously, you need to own up to your mistakes.
Use the phrase ""I was wrong"" when you are taking responsibilities for your actions.
Acknowledge how your actions have negatively affected others. For example, if you were being a distraction in class, tell your teacher ""I'm sorry for distracting my classmates. I regret that my actions hurt you and them.""
If a teacher sees that you are taking responsibility for your actions, they may decide that you no longer need detention., It is important that you state a clear plan to change. Your teacher won't accept your apology if this is a recurring problem. Learn from this mistake and genuinely vow to not repeat this bad action again.


Say ""Next time..."" or ""In the future, I will..."" to explain your plan to change. Provide your teacher with a valid plan for the future.
For example, if you were talking back to your teacher, say ""In the future, I will express my concerns to you privately after class instead of talking back to you in front of other students.""
Tell your teacher that you don't need detention because you've already learned from your mistakes., If you believe you don't deserve to be in detention, ask your teacher if you can speak with them privately. Maybe somebody else blamed you for something that they did, or maybe your teacher got the facts wrong. Telling your teacher the truth may be able to get you out of detention.


Stay civil when talking to your teacher. Don't yell or get upset, because it will look like you are being defensive. Instead, remain calm when telling your teacher your side of the story., Being a kid or a teenager can be difficult – you have to deal with hormones and puberty, bullying, your new love life, your home life, confidence issues, etc. Any of these reasons can sometimes cause you to act out, or do something you normally wouldn't. If you are struggling with something, try talking to your teacher about it.


Talking to your teacher might help them understand your actions. If you're battling some personal problems, that might explain why you're acting out in class. Try to be honest about what's going on in your life with your teacher. Are you having problems at home? Are you being bullied? Maybe your teacher can help you deal with your problems.
Getting out of detention is only one small perk of telling your teacher about your problems. Teachers can be great resources for advice and problem solving., Be honest with your teachers instead of making excuses. Even if your honest reasons aren't good reasons, your teacher will appreciate your honesty. If they see that you are willing to be honest about your actions, they may forgive you, resulting in you not having to serve detention.


Honesty is appreciated by teachers. If they believe you're being honest about your actions, they'll believe that you're being honest about not making the same mistake again.
Don't downplay your actions or make them into jokes. This will show your teacher that you are not sorry for your actions and you will most likely have to serve detention., Arguing, yelling, cursing, lying, threatening, or challenging your teacher in front of other students will not get you out of detention. In fact, those actions will most likely get you more detentions. Your teacher is an authority figure, so you should treat them with respect.


Challenging your teacher's decision in front of other students will make your teacher feel obligated to maintain their authority. If you want to talk with your teacher, do so privately and remain calm.
Never lie about your reasons for your behavior. Teachers can usually detect when you're lying, so honesty is your best bet.
The worst thing you can do is threaten your teacher or swear at your teacher. Doing this will make matters even worse.Telling your teacher that they're not being fair or honest might be true, but it might not be helpful if your goal is to get the teacher to change their mind. If your teacher is genuinely being unfair, move on to Part 3.

, Your parents talking to your teacher might help in a few different scenarios. Get your parents involved if talking to your teacher on your own hasn't worked.


If you are going through a hard time at home, sometimes it can help to have your parents talk to your teacher. Maybe there's been a recent death in your family, it might help for your parents to communicate that to your teacher. Having a parent talk to your teacher will stop you from looking like you're making excuses.
If you think your teacher is being unfair, you should tell your parents. Your parents may be able to help the situation by getting involved., Talk to another teacher about your situation if the teacher you're in trouble with won't listen to you. If a teacher is sick of hearing excuses, they might refuse to talk with you about your detention. However, if you firmly believe you don't deserve detention, talk to a teacher you are close with about the situation.


This teacher may be able to talk with the other teacher that you're in trouble with and get you out of detention.
This teacher may be able to listen to the situation and help you understand why you were wrong., If you've already talked to your parents and your teachers, but still believe that you have been given unfair detention, talk to your principal. This should only be considered if you are certain that you did nothing wrong and that you don't deserve to be on detention.


Principals are typically very busy, so don't bother them about your detention until you've tried every other possible option."

Search the internet for tips from other people who struggle with anxiety.,
Talk about your struggles.,
Request disability accommodations.,
Identify your feelings.,

Use a comfort object or favorite fidget toy.,
Avoid using technology as a distraction.,
Take one small step to fight whatever problem you're afraid of.",How to Be Ready for Anxiety at School," Preparation is the key word. It avoids last-minute stress and give you a good feeling when you know everything is taken care of. Try to have everything prepared the night before.



Clothes. Choose which clothes you're going to wear the night before. Put them somewhere in your room so don't have to go looking for it. Also, this way you know that it's not still in the dryer or something like that.

Books. Look at your schedule to see which subjects you have the next day. Put this in your bag and make sure you don't forget anything. Also check if you have the school supplies in your bag, such as: agenda, case, calculator, etc.

Homework. Be sure you have finished your homework. Try to do your homework as soon as you know what to do. This way you won't have last-minute stress when you forgot something or something happens. This will also help avoiding late nights when you have underestimated your homework.;
, Does your friend keep making racist remarks and making you feel upset? Stop hanging out with him. Are you overwhelmed by your coursework? See if you can switch to a lighter schedule. This is not ""giving up""—it is making decisions to protect your health.

, Turn a two-page essay into a list of paragraphs to complete one at a time. (You don't have to start with your first paragraph!) Turn a long reading into 5-page sections, or go one chapter at a time. This will help make it more manageable, and you can reward yourself each time you get one piece done.


Remember, avoidance makes anxiety worse, and taking small steps reduces anxiety. Do something now.


, Every night, write down two things that you're grateful for today. Let it become a habit. Studies have found again and again that thankful people are happier people, and experience less anxiety.


""I'm thankful that my little brother hugged me today and asked to play with me. I can tell he loves me very much.""
""I'm thankful that my mom took time to help me with my physics homework.""
""I'm thankful for the warm, sunny weather there was today.""

, Spending time outside can help you feel more relaxed and energized. Try taking walks with loved ones, playing backyard sports, swimming, hiking, or biking. Even taking five minutes to walk around the block is better than not going outside at all.

, Your health is important, and taking good care of your body will place less stress on your mind. Get 8-10 hours of sleep, fill 1/3 of your plate with fruits and vegetables, and find little ways to get exercise. You are your own best friend. Take care of yourself.

, Help them with projects, snuggle, go places together, or just hang out. Spending time on people who make you feel relaxed will help you unwind.

, This may seem counterintuitive, but giving your brain a break will allow it to perform even better when you work. Relaxation will help your mental health. Try snuggling, knitting, reading, hanging out with loved ones, or working on your hobbies.

, People with anxiety disorders often congregate in disability/mental illness communities, such as mental health websites or parts of Tumblr. You can ask them for advice, read the resources they write, and support each other.

, Try to talk with a specialist (like a psychologist or school counselor) about it and search for some helping tricks. You could also talk about it with a friend or just write about it in a diary. Having someone act as a sounding board, or simply being able to vent, will help keep the thoughts from consuming you. Also, you can find out what makes you panic and what makes you relax.

, If you have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, you have a documented disability and can receive help. This may include extended time on tests, flexibility with due dates, or allowance of extra absences due to frequent illness. Accommodations are required of many schools, and will help you get the equal access you deserve.

, Are you nervous, worried, stressed, on edge? Why do you feel this way? Understanding your feelings and labeling them is the first step in handling them.


The website tumblr has a lot of relaxation blogs that can help refocus and reassure you.

, These will help you focus on something besides your worries—either something physical or something imaginary. Tell yourself that the next five minutes are for relaxation only, and you can do something after that.


Count, or recite multiplication tables in your head.

Focus on your senses and what's around you. Describe it to yourself in your head.
Do breathing exercises.
Imagine a nature scene in your head. Build the details into the nicest place you can.

, Toys such as tangles, stress balls, or tiny stuffed animals may be relaxing to you. Try manipulating a toy in one hand while you write with the other.


If your teacher asks, explain that it helps you focus. As long as your toy is not disruptive (i.e., silent and fairly discreet) it should be allowed.
Vitamin drops, hard candies, and gum (if allowed) can provide a similar relaxing effect.

, Finding random YouTube videos or playing on your phone will only allow anxiety to build up under the surface. You need to do something productive, either to lessen the thing that is causing your anxiety, or to counteract anxiety symptoms.

, If you're scared of an essay, write two sentences of it. If you're worried about your grade in your Java class, work on a program or study code a little. Sometimes, the act of doing something (even something small) can greatly relieve your anxiety. Say to yourself, ""There, brain! I did something. Now be quiet!""

Pass notes.,
Draw or write in a notebook.,
Create a challenge for yourself.,
Read.,
Listen to music or podcasts on your headphones.,
Take a walk through the halls.,
Daydream.,
Play with your phone.",How to Have Fun During a Detention1," If you're bored during detention, sometimes socializing can be fun. However, talking is often not allowed when you're being punished. Therefore, passing notes can be a great way to socialize without getting in more trouble.


There are many stealthy ways to pass notes in class. You can write notes on small pieces of paper. Slide them to a classmate. You can also fold up a piece of paper until it's very small and then ""accidentally"" drop it near a classmate while going to, say, sharpen your pencil.
Watch what you write. In the event your note is found, you do not want to write anything that could get you into more trouble. Avoid writing down the names of teachers or classmates. Do not include your own name anywhere on the note.;
, Most schools will allow you to have a small notebook on your desk during detention. You can use the notebook to pass the time. Draw or write when you get bored.


Just start writing. Let your thoughts pour onto the page. Try starting with, ""I'm bored"" and go from there. You may find a lot of new and interesting ideas spilling out when you release your thoughts without filter.If you're a creative type, try to write a story. Look around the room and find three things and try to incorporate all of them into a short story. For example, write a story that includes an eraser, a lunchbox, and a boy named Jason.
If you like drawing, try drawing or doodling in your notebook. Draw a rough sketch of the teacher overseeing detention. Draw a picture of a scene outside. Doodle a fun comic to pass the time.

, Oftentimes, boredom stems from a lack of challenges. If you're being forced to sit and do nothing, this can grow boring. If you want to combat boredom, try to think of a challenge for yourself to pass the time.Think of your favorite song. See if you can write down the lyrics from memory.
Write the alphabet down the side of a piece of paper. Then, pick a category, like ""Girl's names."" Try to think of three girl's name for every letter of the alphabet. For example, ""A. Ava, Ada, Annie, B. Bonnie, Bridget, Brita, C. Cassie, Carol, Camille..."" It may seem easy, but it can get tricky when you get to letters like ""X"" and ""Y.""
Is there a clock in the room? If so, try to write down that poem you had to memorize for 8th grade English on a piece of paper. See how long it takes to write it down. Then, try to beat that time.

, If you're allowed to do so, reading can be a great way to pass the time. You can escape to the world of a book, making the hours fly by more easily.


Ideally, you should choose a book you're reading for pleasure. If you're reading a book for school, you may feel bored by it more easily.
However, some schools may have rules that dictate you have to do homework during detention. Try to at least pick a book that deals with a subject you enjoy. If you loathe your science class, but always enjoyed history, thumb through your history textbook during detention.
Some teachers may allow you to read as long as it's educational. Try to find fun educational books in your school's library. New Journalism, for example, is a form of journalism that uses literary techniques to talk about historical events. It can be more engaging than a typical history book. Try reading some Gore Vidal and Joan Didion and see if you feel engaged.

, If you're able to listen to your headphones in detention, this can be a fun way to pass the time. Try listening to a podcast you like or an album you enjoy. This can make detention pass by more easily.


If you're not allowed to listen to your headphones, you may be able to do so in secret. If you have a hooded sweatshirt, for example, pull up your hood and place your headphones in your ears.
If you're listening to anything not appropriate for school, keep the volume low so your teacher doesn't overhear.

, Oftentimes, a short walk can help to alleviate boredom. If you feel like the time is dragging on, a short walk through the hallway can break up the monotony. Ask for the bathroom pass or claim you need to get something from your locker. Then, enjoy the freedom of walking through the hallway for a few minutes.Try not to be gone too long. If you take 15 minutes to run to the bathroom, or are getting your science book for 20 minutes, your teacher will get suspicious. You may end up in more trouble than you were to begin with.

, Daydreaming can be an excellent way to pass the time in any given situation. It's particularly nice in detention because it's risk free. Your teacher cannot read your thoughts, so you'll be able to daydream without getting in trouble.


Fantasize about imaginary realities. For example, what would it be like if you had super powers? How would you feel to be part of your favorite television show? Have you ever wondered what it would be like to meet a celebrity?Allow your daydreams to occur organically. It's very hard to force yourself to daydream if you're not in the mood. If you're struggling to daydream during detention, try to do something else., If you're allowed to have your phone out during detention, playing with your phone can be a great way to pass time. You can text your friends, watch videos, go on the internet, play games, or listen to music.


If you're not allowed to have your cell phone in detention, you may not want to risk it. It's very hard to stealthily use a cell phone, and you may risk getting your phone taken away if you're using it in detention.
Be careful when using the internet. If your school does not have wifi, streaming movies on Netflix can eat up a lot of your data.

Get the detention.,
If a friend or acquaintance, or even an enemy, asks what is wrong, don't tell them.,
Try to talk to the teacher.,
When you get home, especially if your teacher has contacted your parent, they might be...pissed off, to say the least.,
If they won't quit interrupting you, tell them, respectfully, ""Please, let me explain.,
When explaining, don't cry!,
Before your detention, you will need to deal with what you will do there.,
Be respectful when you are in your detention!",How to Be Okay at Your First Detention," Your teacher has just talked to you and you are crying. This is bad...especially if it is at the beginning of the day, because then you'll just have the worst day ever. You need to take a breath and dry your eyes. This time is about you. Ask if you may go to the restroom, if you need a few minutes to yourself.;
, The whole world does not need to know what just happened. That is your information and for you to know and them not to find out.

, Don't make excuses and DON'T try saying you didn't do it, because they might think you are lying. Just explain what happened and tell them that you are sorry. Let them know, even if you don't truly, that you understand why you are in trouble. Tell them--and be true to your word--that you will not let it happen again.

, Start by asking them how many detentions them and their spouse have ever gotten. Let them know that even Einstein got in trouble every here and there. You aren't the first good student to get in trouble, and you won't be the last.

, I understand I made a mistake. Would you please just let me explain what happened?""

, Talk in your big boy/girl voice, or else they will think you aren't ready to explain. Tell the full story--even your mistakes. Tell them what you told the teacher--about how you understand that you made a mistake and you promise you won't let it happen again.

, Depending on your school, you can do different things. If you can draw--great! See, you can already do something semi-fun, depending on the mood you are in that day! I would advise getting any homework you have for that day--and your textbooks. Then you could hang out with friends and chill after you serve your detention. Bring books also; at least two. If you finish all of your work and can't draw, you will want to read a good book.

, If you are not, that is a good way to have to serve another detention--and get grounded.

"
"
Complete any required activities.,
Do your homework.,
Do extra credit.,
Set some goals for yourself.",How to Have Fun During a Detention2," If you have to do certain activities during detention, try to take them seriously. While they may not seem fun, in comparison to sitting around with nothing to do, they may seem like a relief. Do not rush through activities and end up bored for the next 40 minutes.


In detention, you may have to write down why you got in trouble. A teacher may ask you to reflect on your actions in an essay, for example. Try to do the best you can. Spend some time seriously considering the assignment.
You may learn something from the required assignment. If you're in detention because you hurt a student or teacher's feelings, for example, it's important that you reflect on what you said.

, While doing homework may not seem like fun, it's a good way to pass the time. You may feel like you're having fun if you feel like you're being productive. Doing homework can give you a feeling of accomplishment, which can be enjoyable.


Try to do assignment you'd be likely to put off at home. This way, when you finish detention you can relax and unwind.
If the person supervising detention is a teacher, doing homework in that teacher's subject can be a good way to pass time. If your algebra teacher is supervising you, you'll be able to ask for his or her help if you're struggling with a math problem.

, You may not have homework to do during detention. However, there are other ways to be productive and make the time go by faster. Are any of your teachers offering extra credit? You could take your detention period as an opportunity to complete an extra credit assignment. You'll end up passing the time while earning additional points in your course.

, Do you have any goals you want to set for yourself? Detention could be a good to reflect on your goals. If you're in middle school or high school, you may want to start thinking about your future.


Make plans for your education. If you want to get into a decent school, think about what you can do to increase your chances. What extracurricular activities would look good on an application, for example? Should you work on bringing your grades up in any subjects?Set dates for yourself. For example, if you're working on a short story, pull out a calendar. Plan to have a draft done by, say, the 15th of February. Then, plan to have that revised by the 8th of March."
"
Know the teacher's personality.,
Respect the rules.,
Reflect on why you're in detention.",How to Have Fun During a Detention3," It's great to try to make the most out of a negative situation. However, you want to make sure you avoid getting into further trouble. Know who's running the detention and what that teacher's personality is like. Some teachers may be very strict and vigilant while others may be somewhat lax about the rules.


If you don't know the teacher, ask other students who've worked with this teacher in the past. They may be able to offer some insight that can help you navigate detention.
If you're stuck with a strict teacher, make a point of following the rules. Even if it's difficult, you want to avoid getting into further trouble.

, What are the rules in your school regarding conduct for detention? Make sure you know them going into detention. You want to avoid getting into more trouble.


You do not want to end up in detention in another week or have to face more serious consequences. If your school has strict rules, try to follow them.
Some rules are easily bendable. For example, while outside reading may be forbidden, a particular teacher may not strictly enforce such rules. In that situation, bend the rules to pass the time.
However, if a teacher asks you to stop a particular behavior, do not push it. You are in detention for a reason. Being disrespectful of the rules could land you in more trouble.

, During detention, take some time to reflect on why you're there. You may be able to figure out how to avoid ending up in detention in the future.


If you're in detention because you had too many tardies, think of ways to better manage your time. Plan to get up an hour early in the mornings. Think about avoiding checking your phone or going on the computer until you're showered and dressed.
If you're in detention for disrespecting a teacher, consider why you were disrespectful. You do not want to get in trouble again. If you have trouble managing your outbursts, talk to your parents about possibly seeing a psychiatrist to talk about regulating your emotions.
If you hurt another student's feelings, reflect on how that student may feel. Think about the comments you made. Imagine how you would feel if someone said something like that about you or a friend. After detention, make an effort to genuinely apologize to that student.

"
"
Accept the fact that you have a detention.,
Make a note of the time and place and who it's with.,
Check what you are doing.,
Make travel arrangements.,
Arrive on time.,
Present yourself well.,
Don't repeat what you did to get the detention in the detention.,
Do what the teacher tells you i.e.,
Some schools ask you to write lines in accordance with what you did to get the detention; i.e.,
Be polite, and calm in the detention.",How to Survive an English School Detention," Whether you think you deserve it or not, accept the fact and deal with it later. Do not assume or insist you are right and that the teacher/person who gave you the detention is wrong. It may be the other way around.;
, If it's a break time, lunchtime, after school and whether it's in a classroom, a hall or in a different building. Make sure you know who it's with - a special detention supervisor, a teacher or even the watchful eye of the principal or headmaster/headmistress - make sure you know.

, Some schools have a rubbish collection scheme going on or may make you clean under desks (especially if you were caught chewing gum in some schools) during detention time, and may expect you to take part. In that case, don't wear fancy clothes or shoes, and expect to get dirty.

, If you catch a bus, make sure you know whether there is another bus, or whether you will have to walk home. Ask if your parents can pick you up, or if you will have to take a taxi. If there is no available transport you will have to ask your parents or guardians to write or telephone the school as to changing the time, i.e. if an after-school detention for an hour can be changed to two half an hour lunchtime detentions. You should be the one to check that, and you should do it before the day of the detention. Be reasonable and accept that if you live close by and go home by walking, you are unlikely to be allowed to change an after-school detention to a lunchtime one.

, Just because you think you don't deserve it, you can't turn up late. Arriving on time presents a positive image, and can make people less predisposed to handing you a new detention. Using the bathroom before going to detention is often a good idea because you may not be allowed to use the bathroom during detention.

, If you wear a school uniform, wear it properly, i.e. with the tie done up properly, shirt tucked in e.t.c, with no extra additions like funky belts or badges. If you have to wear them, keep them in your bag, and put them on after the detention. If you don't have to wear school uniform, still wear decent clothes, and wear them properly. Hitch up the trousers, pull down the skirts to a reasonable length and just grin and bear it. As soon as you step off the school premises, you can put your clothes back to how you like them.

, If you got the detention for being late to a class, ARRIVE ON TIME TO THE DETENTION. If you got the detention for carrying an mp3 player or wearing incorrect uniform, don't wear them or hide the device/buttons/badges/belts. It's an hour maximum of your time. Surely taking your belt off for that amount of time will not kill you. If it does, you may want to see someone about it. Do not chew gum. It is a prime time way for teachers to give you a new detention.

, where to sit. Don't argue or ignore them. It is not in your best interests to do so.

, ""I must arrive on time to all my lessons."" Others will just expect you to sit down and read or do homework in the allocated time as long as you do not communicate with others in anyway.

, Do not loudly proclaim innocence or how unfair the detention is. It is a sure fire way of getting another one.

Talk when you're not supposed to.,
Irritate your teacher.,
Make a lot of noise.,
Start singing, and get other people to join in.,
Forget all of your supplies.,
Look up your school policies, so you don't take it too far.",How to Get a Detention1," Want to get in trouble real quick? Just talk when your teacher is talking, or when you're supposed to be quiet. Here are a bunch of ways to talk when you're not supposed to:


Wait until you've just been given a test, then start raising your hand and asking questions about the homework.
Interrupt other students when they're reading out loud, or if they're presenting their Science/Biome Projects. Start by saying inappropriate phrases to make their words more funny. After those students are finished, yell out, ""BOO!"" or ""You suck!"".
Wait until you've got silent work time and start talking to your neighbor, or laughing loudly.
When another student is answering a question, yell out, ""Wrong!"" or ""Fake!"", even if it's right.
Just start talking without raising your hand. Instead of waiting to be called on, launch into your question or comment.
During a video, start responding to everything the characters say as if they were in the room with you. Or, say inappropriate phrases at any part of the characters' sentences to make them more funny.;
, Your teacher will give you a detention if you're just being an irritating presence in the class. Want to get on your teacher's nerves quickly? Try out some of these:


Call the teacher by their first name, a nickname, or someone else's name all through class.
Argue with a teacher, claiming there is a test today and you know it. Or, claim there was no homework.
Write a fake note saying you're excused from class because it is boring. Teachers will automatically know it's fake. Say it's true and deny everything. When the jig is up, consider bursting into tears or screaming, whichever one you'd prefer.
Correct the teacher whenever you can. Make sure all of your corrections are completely off-topic or incorrect. Always pretend you're right and never let the teacher speak.
Ask a lot of personal questions about the teacher. Be as annoying about this as possible. Give them suggestions about their love life, driving skills or their teaching. If they mention anything at all related to LGBT, ask them if they are gay, then start telling everyone about how we need to be nice to gay people.
When the teacher asks a question to the whole class, reply loudly, ""Your Mama!"", ""Your Mom!"", or ""Your Grandma!""
Every ten minutes, ask when class will be over.
In class, yell out ""BORING!"" There's a definite detention for you.

, If it's quiet, or your teacher is talking, just start making a ruckus without saying anything at all. Here are some good ways to get your teacher annoyed with noise:


Try imitating someone with brain damage, pretending to have a seizure and twitching a lot.
Beat box loudly. Beat box in the middle of a test when the teacher has asked for no talking.
Tap your fingers on your desk for the whole class.
Click your pen or tap your pencil on your desk.
Keep a phone or iPod hidden and play random animal sounds. Start acting scared, because you hear lions.

, Start quiet, and then get louder and louder as you go, trying to turn your class into a school musical. Almost a guaranteed detention awaits any of these ideas:


Sing random songs you know almost everyone hates - like ""Friday"" by Rebecca Black or ""Baby "" by Justin Bieber. Better yet, do it right in the middle of the lesson.
Compose a rap about how bad school is. To be as annoying as possible, sing it near the principal's office or the detention room very loudly.

, While this might get you into more grade trouble than you want, it also might be a good way to get a detention if you use it to start a general distraction in class. Here are some ways to come to class unprepared and be a nuisance:


Ask to get your supplies one at a time when you need them. Turn to one neighbor and ask loudly, ""Can I borrow a pencil?"" Five minutes later, turn to another and ask, ""Can I borrow some paper?"" and so on.
Spend a good ten to fifteen minutes trying to get a hoodie on or off. Make sure it has some rude slogan on it you might get in trouble for.
Behave well all day, then volunteer to read aloud. As you read, start stammering on every word and read like a 4-year old, or add inappropriate phrases to make the sentences more funny.
Read as loudly or softly as possible, or make everything you read a run-on sentence.

, At your school, there will be all kinds of different ways you can get into trouble. Find out the policies that you can break that are detention-worthy, and make sure to avoid the ones that are suspension-worthy.


Most schools will have ""strikes."" If you do something once, you'll usually get a warning. If you do it twice, you may get a detention. More times might get you into more trouble, so know when to quit.
Other more serious offenses shouldn't be done if you're just trying to get a detention. You don't want to end up suspended. Pulling fire alarms, stealing, robbing, and other methods will actually get you into trouble with the police.

Move around when you're not supposed to.,
Annoy other students.,
Text on your cellphone.,
Break specific classroom rules.,
Fake some bodily functions.",How to Get a Detention2," If you want to do a little more than just be a general nuisance in class, acting out in goofy ways can get you a couple of detentions, when done properly. Here are some ways to get up and disrupt class physically:


Wait until everything is silent. Get up and start doing press-ups. Do it until you get to twenty, and then roll over and start doing sit ups. If you do it making as much noise as possible, then before you get to five press-ups the teacher will ask what you are doing. That's your cue to say, ""Well, I don't want to look like you, do I?""
Sit on your chair upside down. Make sure your head is where your legs should be and your thighs are stood up where your upper body would be and your legs are dangling down the back of the chair.
Walk out of class. If the teacher asks why, just say you were thirsty or you forgot a pencil from your locker. If you really want to get your teacher mad, say you're leaving because you're bored.
Do the exact opposite of what the teacher says. If she says to turn in your papers, keep it under your chair.
Be tardy as often as possible. After a few times, you'll get a detention.
Put your head down and try to fall asleep in class. Snore loudly. Don't get up when your teacher calls on you.

, You don't have to just annoy your teacher. If you're bothering other students, they might tell on you, and you'll end up in detention. Try poking them, throwing things at them, or starting pointless conversations with them. Here are some other ideas:


Pass notes around, or better yet, throw them at random people, including the teacher. Avoid making other people look guilty so that the teacher can tell it is you.
Throw pencils or pens.
Shoot spitballs at random people. Yell ""DUCK AND COVER!"" and shoot a whole bunch at once. Hit the teacher as often as possible, if you're daring, but this could merit suspension.
Set up folders around your desk. When the teacher asks, say ""I'm afraid someone will cheat!""
For no reason, duck low and do an air-raid-siren sound. Then point at your teacher and say, ""We're being bombed again by Hitler!""

, If the teacher decides to take your cellphone away, refuse to hand it over. This may result in many detentions and/or your device taken away.


Take your iPod or iPhone. Try to watch a movie. For a little extra annoyance, eat a lot of popcorn or candy with the movie. People will ask for some and it might distract people from the teacher for a while.
If you listen to your iPod, listen to your music as loudly as you can. Dance to it, too. If your teacher decides to take away your iPod, refuse to hand it over.

, In some classes, the following steps might not get you into much trouble, but in others they might be detention worthy. Check out your specific classroom rules for more ways to get detention:


Chew gum in class, or eat something. If your teacher doesn't notice, blow big bubbles and pop them and smack your lips loudly. Offer other students a piece, or charge them for it.
Sit in your seat, and do nothing. This can irritate the teacher very much, and you could get in trouble.
Eat, and do so very rudely and loudly. Bring in a bottle of soda, a water bottle, a cereal bar, or a small bag of chips. Chew with your mouth open. Gargle the drink. Then, choke on it and spit it out all over someone.
Bring in your whole makeup bag, a brush, and a small mirror. Pile it across your desk and make yourself pretty! If for some reason the teacher doesn't notice, ask her if your lip-gloss is too dark or your eyeshadow too light.
Get changed in class. Wear a tank top and shorts. Put a shirt over the tank top, then a hoodie or another shirt. Put jeans over the shorts. Wear flip-flops. Take them off, and put on socks and tennis shoes.

, When nature calls, you can have a good excuse to cause a big scene. Or even if nature isn't calling, you can fake it. This will annoy everyone in the classroom:


Ask to go to the restroom in the middle of an important lesson or a test. When the teacher says no, wait five minutes and ask again. Do that about three times. Grab your crotch, raise your hand, and yell out ""I GOTTA GO PEE! OH, OH PLEASE! I GOTTA GO PEE!""
Run to the trash can, lean over it, and make puking noises. Wait until everyone looks over. Take your head out and laugh, saying ""I GOT YOU NOW, DUMBHEAD!!""

Break rules in the cafeteria.,
Act out in convocations or assemblies.,
Act out at performances or concerts.,
Mess around in the computer lab.",How to Get a Detention3," The cafeteria can be a loud and rowdy place. The perfect place for getting into trouble. If you want to get busted into detention, here are a couple of ideas:


Throw any kind of lunch bag, piece of tinfoil, or an empty bottle at somebody. If a nearby adult catches you, you might get kicked out of the cafeteria.
Take food off of someone's plate and just start eating it. Wait for them to tell on you.
If there is a huge crowd of people entering the hallway from the cafeteria, and you're one of those people, find a couple of people and bang into one another. Shove people out of your way. If a nearby adult sees you, you will be given a verbal warning. If it continues, you could get a detention.

, If you have to sit around with a bunch of other kids, it's probably an important time to sit quietly and learn something important for everyone. Or it could be a great opportunity to get busted. If you want a detention, try out the following:


When the principal walks in and starts talking, shout, ""Who IS that chump?""
Start asking any students who have to speak or get up on stage. Just yell weird or random stuff: ""Voldemort loves you Mr. Douchebag!""
Squeak your chair loudly, or talk loudly to your neighbors. Keep doing it when you're told to stop.
Tell a speaker to shut up, that you're trying to sleep.

, If you have to sit through a band concert or a choir concert at your school, it's important to be on your best behavior. Unless you want a detention. Here's how to get one:


After the song, yell out ""BOO!"" to the performers. Or don't clap to the performers and stand up and start asking them questions instead.
Comment inappropriate things to your friends about the song. Be aware that this may distract the rest of the audience.
Laugh at the performers during or after the song. Or disrupt them by shouting/saying inappropriate words that make the lyrics funny, or making jokes about how they look.
If you have an assembly before your lunch period, bring out some small candy from the cafeteria. People may ask for some. Better yet, chuck them at the performers instead.

, Technology class is a great place to learn and interact with technology. It's also a great place to get detention. If you want to stick around before/after school or during lunch, try out these ideas:


If you need to use a computer in class, go on another website instead of what you’re supposed to do. Tap friends’ shoulders and show them what you're doing.
Start playing a computer game instead. Scream Yeah! if you get a point. If you lose a point, shout something inappropriate.
Crank the sound on a YouTube video and start blasting it. Play Lil Wayne's ""A Milli"" or anything that would get you into trouble.

"
"
Get organized.,
Get a decent backpack.,
Get yourself a locker.",How to Be Good at School1," Buy or unearth some new supplies that will keep you organized. For example, use folders, binders, files, trays and pencil cases to keep everything in its rightful place.


If you love stationery (and who doesn't), consider purchasing items in your favorite colors, or covering your trays/binders, etc. with patterned paper that pleases you. By making things more appealing, you're more likely to use them.;
, Use one that can carry all of your books and other bits and pieces, as well as fitting your back properly. Backpacks should be comfortable and able to support your posture. Avoid any backpack that feels uncomfortable or pulls on your back and neck.

, The locker will allow you to store stuff at school and have it easily available when you need gym clothes, binders, etc. Don't leave valuables in it though; always follow school policy with respect to bringing such things to school and where to leave them during the day.


Put in shelves, a calendar, and all the things you need for class.

"
"
Do your homework regularly.,
Learn to follow the teachers' directions.,
Take notes on what the teachers are saying.,
Study every night just to see what you have learned.",How to Be Good at School2," Set aside a regular time each day to do homework. Even if the time shifts around due to other commitments, always stick to it. Homework exists for a reason––to expand your understanding and to force you to think for yourself, rather than simply relying on what the teacher has to dish out. See it as improving yourself, only this part of yourself is your mind.


If you have trouble with anything, ask the teacher, read further in the book, use your notes or search online. When something is difficult, use this as an opportunity to extend yourself and learn more, rather than as an excuse to give up.

, Teachers ask you to do things for your own benefit. It might not seem like it at the time but in the long run, learning to listen to authority and follow instructions does have a purpose. You will have to do this throughout your life, so the sooner that you realize this is a useful skill, the better. Of course, this doesn't mean that you can't question what is asked of you. But there is a polite way of doing so, which will always work better than the brusque way. Be polite, show that you have thought through things before simply snapping or rebelling. In the long run, knowing how to ask intelligent questions that show that you both understand the instructions but see a better way of doing things will be more likely to get you what you want.

, Make it short notes in a notebook or a composition book. Summarize. This will help you to keep track of the things you need to learn in greater depths.

, Do this every night no matter if you have a test the next day. Gradual retention is always better and longer lasting than last-minute cramming.

Consider why you think it's beneficial to play up at school.,
Realize that people's tolerance doesn't last forever.,
Stop doing it.,
Ask for help.,
Apologize.,
Get on with your life.",How to Be Good at School3," Perhaps you get attention, perhaps it's just fun to be cheeky or perhaps you are covering up an inability to do something. In some cases, you may have found it has been easier to be a bully than to reach out and get help for the reasons you're lashing out at innocent people. Whatever the reason, try to identify what is motivating your bad behavior.

, Even if you've been getting away with bad behavior, you'll already have a reputation and eventually, even the patient people will get tired of your behavior.

, It's really as simple as that. While it may feel odd, by no longer doing the badly behaved things, you can move on. People may say things to remind you of what you used to do, but simply say that's how you used to be, that you've thought about it and have changed things. You don't need to make up any excuses, just move on.

, If you're finding it hard to stop behaving badly, seek help from someone you trust. This might be a teacher, a parent/guardian, a friend, a counselor, a person of faith, or any other person you trust. Explain what you're going through and see how they can help you move past it.

, If you've hurt people as a result of your behavior, it can be a good way to start over by apologizing to them. Do not expect them to be convinced by your apology or to believe that you've mended your ways, simply be genuine in your own intention and move on. You will prove to these people that you mean your apology through your future actions towards them.

, Do all the things outlined above to improve academically and start filling your life with external activities that you enjoy, such as sport, a hobby or chatting to friends. Don't linger over what was. Look forwards.

Don’t hold a grudge.,

Turn off your cellphone.,
Use it as a life lesson.",How to Deal With Detentions," All schools have written rules and use disciplinary actions like detention to encourage students to follow them. Your school most likely issues an official student handbook that outlines its detention policy.


If you believe you didn’t break any of these rules, politely explain that the rule is not properly stated or should be clarified.;
, Teachers are often stressed out because they deal with a large number of students every day and have limited time to get through their lesson plans.They need a classroom that is focused on the work and may be strict because of this.


Empathizing with your teacher can help you accept your situation and not take it personally.

, If you aren’t clear about the rule you broke, politely ask for clarification.


Consider your tone when asking or you may come off as combative and make the situation worse. Say something like ""Excuse me. I understand you think you I broke a rule but I can't seem to find it in the handbook. Can you explain which rule I violated?"" to start the conversation. Make sure to have a copy of the rules on hand.
If asked sincerely, this can demonstrate that you’re interested in avoiding issues in the future., Detentions often require that you receive a signature from your legal guardians before you return to school the next day. Plan your approach so they understand your side of the story.


Even if your school doesn’t require a signature, your guardians will likely find out anyway so being forthright with them is your best chance at controlling the situation.
Start the conversation by saying something simple like “Hey, I have to tell you something.” Avoid alarming introductions like “I have some bad news” because it may set a more negative tone for the conversation.

, Being honest about what you did wrong will be appreciated and give you credibility.They will likely be more upset if they find out you are not being honest about the situation.

, It’s important to tell your guardians about your detention as promptly as possible. But if they are coming home from work or are otherwise stressed out, you may want to wait for the right moment.


Try to deliver the news calmly. Make sure you’re not too emotional.
If you tell them at the wrong time, they may react in anger and it will be more difficult for you to tell your side of the story., Explain what you learned from the experience and what you will do differently the next time.


Even if you are maintaining that you did nothing wrong, explain how you will avoid putting yourself in bad situations in the future. For example, by avoiding students that are known to get in trouble or creating a better relationship with your teacher., A respectful tone can make all the difference when having a tense conversation so don’t interrupt or get an attitude, even if you feel they’re being unfair.Finding out their child has a detention can be stressful for your guardians. Try to understand that their first reaction will most likely be disappointment and it’s your job to improve their perception by demonstrating you’re responsible and mature.
If there is a punishment, accept it gracefully.

, If you were given detention by your teacher, you will obviously continue to see them on a regular basis so don’t let this ruin the rest of your year.


Even if it’s an administrator, you’re likely to see them in the hallways or cafeteria.
Find a constructive way to either repair your relationship with them or avoid further confrontations.

, You have nothing to gain from holding onto your frustration. Like it or not, this teacher controls your grades and can potentially give you more detentions.


Even if you don’t intend to create any problems, simply remaining angry can lead to negative confrontations in the future. Holding a grudge can also be bad for your health., If you did something wrong or if you made an honest mistake, a simple apology is a great idea.


Because they deal with youths all day, most teachers appreciate maturity and will see a sincere apology as a sign that you’re taking an adult view of the situation.Approach your teacher before or after class and be direct. Say something like “I understand why you had to give me detention. I didn’t mean to cause any disruption. I’m ready to get back to work.”
It may surprise you how quickly a teacher can go from having a negative attitude toward you to a positive one when you demonstrate maturity.

, Like an apology, maintaining a constructive focus on the classwork and performing well on assignments is an excellent way to demonstrate maturity to your teacher and create a positive relationship with them.This is also the best way to deal with any awkwardness between you and the teacher.

, You probably won’t consider your detention a good thing but focusing on the positives can help you get through and make your wasted time as productive as possible. Most schools will allow you to study during detention.


The silence of a detention room can provide the perfect opportunity for you to get your work done.Plan your work ahead of time. Make sure your textbooks, class notes, calculator, worksheets or anything else you’ll need to get something done during detention.

, If you don't feel like completing school work or need materials that won't be available in detention, try drawing a picture. It's a great way to pass the time, stimulate your mind and build an art portfolio.


Even if you aren't a particularly artistic person, practicing art on a regular basis can build your creativity, improve your mental acuity and relieve stress., Another great way to pass the time is to practice your creative writing. Even if it isn't based on a class assignment, you can build a writing portfolio that will be useful for college and job applications.Creative writing during detention improves student behavior and academic outcomes.You can use your experience getting or being in detention for inspiration.

, If it goes off during detention, you could get in more trouble. Turn off any other device that may make a sound that could get you in trouble like a digital watch alarm.

, Even if you believe you truly didn’t do anything wrong, there is still a valuable lesson involved. Not all institutions, rules or authority figures are just and benevolent and coming to terms with this fact in a constructive manner is an essential part of adulthood.If you feel that you were punished by an unfair rule, ask if other students have had similar experiences and see if you can start a conversation with the administration to change it.

Think before you act.,
Avoid fights.,
Get on your teachers' good side.,
Don't be nasty to anyone else.,
Adhere to the school rules.,
Don't tattle-tale on someone, attack that person or make him/her upset.,
Don't take advantage.",How to Avoid Getting Detentions," It seems hard to do and nerdy, but it's very much worth it. Do so before you give a sadistic punch to that kid who beat you at soccer, before you cheat off that smart and highbrow person in your class, and before you vehemently talk back to your teacher. Think, reflect and judge. ""Could I get into trouble if I do this?"" ""Could I get a detention?"" ""Could I endure the punishments?"" ""Would my teacher/parents approve of what I'm about to do?"" It'll take some practice, but soon enough, it'll come automatically like an intuition.;
, This is hard for everyone, but it will save you a good many detentions. Don't pick on anyone or say anything that you could get into trouble for. Avoid physical fighting at all costs.


If you have to stick up for your friend or you can't just let someone insult you, stick to stuff like, ""Push off/Go away,"" ""You can't talk,"" and ""Oh, shut it."" That stuff still sounds cool and assertive, but it's just mild enough to keep you out of trouble, rather than physically attacking people.







, If you and your teacher loathe each other, you're more likely to get a detention. Obey and respect your teacher at all times. Don't suck up to your teacher, just make sure you listen in their classes and aren't too cheeky and disruptive. A little mouth shutting and behaving well can pay off, big time.

, It might seem like this has nothing to do with detention, but you'll find that if you're nice to people, they'll back you up and won't dob you in. So have patience and be nice to everyone. Try to avoid the impulse to give them wet willies. A little smile could save you from a deadly detention.

, This is a very important step. Reread your school's rules and regulations and abstain from vandalizing, etc. By being lawful, you don't have to worry about receiving a detention.

, If that person tattle-taled on you, calmly tell your teacher your side of the story.

, If another student does/says something that you know is wrong, or think may possibly be wrong, you might be in doubt as to whether it is acceptable. Do not copy his/her behavior. This applies, even if he/she is labelled by school officials as a rightful person. Sometimes he or she may do very bad things, but copying him or her could result in a detention.

"
"
State your opinion in class.,
Do your homework.,
Respect your liberal professors.,
Discuss, don’t battle.,
Take your learning beyond the classroom walls.,
Make sure your school has conservative publications.,
Be aware of your own biases.",How to Be Conservative in a Liberal School1," Even if it is unpopular, you have the right to express your point of view. A good professor will be respectful of differences in opinion, and will be able to create a good discussion to the benefit of everyone’s education.;
, Stay current with reading assignments and papers. Being a good student lends credibility to your arguments. Read beyond the text to back up your beliefs with additional insights.

, It is not your imagination, professors are generally liberal,and have even moved further to the left in recent years.Nevertheless, offer them your respect. In spite of their political beliefs, they are still knowledgeable in their field, and have a lot to offer your education.

, Keep your conversations casual and civil. You will make friends instead of enemies. People are more receptive to new ideas if everyone remains friendly!If your opponent becomes angry, try not to feed into it. It makes you the bigger person to try to deescalate the situation and remain calm.
It is up to you if you want to continue to engage with someone who is being hostile. To end the conversation, try saying, “I think we should revisit this another time when we’re not so worked up. Can we agree to disagree in the meantime?” and change the subject.

, You are not limited to your classes for an education. Take the initiative to teach yourself.


Find a recommended reading list of conservative works and read these in your spare time.
Volunteer to work on the campaign of a candidate whose ideals you support. This is also great work experience.
Help get people registered to vote.
Be a poll worker on Election Day.

, Check your school’s library and make sure there is a broad spectrum of political writings represented. Talk to your school’s librarian if you think something is missing.

, How has your upbringing shaped you? Reflect on your heritage and life experience and consider how this has shaped your belief system. Your culture, family, socioeconomic status, and more come into play when you develop your political beliefs.Realize that your classmates’ upbringings also influence their beliefs and create biases. Learning more about your classmates’ backgrounds, as well as sharing yours, can increase mutual understanding. Try asking, “What was your family like growing up? What was your neighborhood like?”

"
"
Know you’re not alone.,
Cast a wider net.,
Learn more about your classmates.,
Look online.,
Consider transferring.",How to Be Conservative in a Liberal School2," College students as a whole are generally more liberal, but that doesn’t mean there are no other conservative college students even on your liberal campus. This can be an opportunity to be a leader and organize like-minded students.


Post flyers around your school or use social media to look for people to join a conservative student group.
If there isn’t a chapter of such a group on your campus, start one! The College Republicans, for example, offer some start-up advice: http://www.crnc.org/chapters/start/


, Broaden your search for fellow conservatives to include your local community, houses of worship, local government, and political parties. As a bonus, getting connected at the local level can give you a real opportunity to affect political change.

, Just because someone identifies as liberal doesn’t mean they don’t have some conservative opinions. In spite of increasing polarization, it doesn’t mean that you will not be able to find some common, middle ground.Take the time to learn about your classmates’ beliefs, and you may be surprised at what you have in common.


Your fellow students will not be as liberal as their professors. Incoming freshmen across all universities are more likely to identify as politically moderate.Therefore, you may find some unexpected allies in class discussions.

, The internet is full of a wide range of political beliefs. If you are unsuccessful in finding people on your campus or in your community to talk to, you will find them online.

, If all else fails, and you do not feel a part of your campus community, look into changing schools. Look for a school that is more in line with your conservative beliefs.


While it is important to stand up for what you believe in, arguing all the time and feeling like you are all alone can be harmful to your mental health. There is no shame in finding a place where you don’t feel like you are constantly fighting a battle!

"
"
Stay true to yourself.,
Learn how to debate.,
Pick your battles.,
Take action.",How to Be Conservative in a Liberal School3," Don’t feel like you need to conform to whatever is popular. Your opinion, though different, is still valuable.


Be open-minded and receptive to hearing new ideas, but this does not mean you need to agree with them. Education is about being exposed to and analyzing different perspectives.

, Read books on the subject, practice your skills, or even join a debate team. This will help you in your classroom discussions, and is a valuable skill to have in life.Stay calm and respectful during debates. Avoid loaded language and name-calling. Instead of “Obamacare was idiotic. He was clearly conspiring with insurance companies,” try saying “Obamacare has become a bureaucratic nightmare, and now insurance companies are profiting off it.”Back up your arguments with facts and statistics. The argument that Ronald Reagan was the best President for the economy will be stronger if you can support it. Try saying, “During Reagan’s presidency, he cut the top tax rate from 70 percent to 28 percent. Freeing up this money from the government allowed industry to create jobs and innovation in the country.”, Expressing your frustration at every liberal perspective will not endear you, or your points of view, to others. Sometimes it may be better to remain silent, or speak with your instructor after class.


Try saying, “Sometimes I feel like I am always the person bringing this up, but I didn’t our discussion on drug offenders offered all perspectives. Instead of raising my hand and having everyone get frustrated at me again, I decided to wait until after class to talk to you.”

, If you feel the classes are too left-leaning, and that your instructors do not do a good job sharing all points of view, be an advocate for your education and work for change.


Write a letter and present it to your principal, dean, school board, or university official. Send it to your school newspaper or local paper as well.
Run for student government. While you may not win due to your school’s demographics, your presence can bring the issue to the table and start a conversation.

Take notes and study them when you get home from school.

Try to finish your work early.,

Sometimes, being disabled will bring you down.,
Be yourself.",How to Be a Good Autistic or Special Needs Student," Every single most successful student paid attention in class. You won't learn anything if you're zoning out while your teacher is talking about the Revolutionary War, even if it is boring.;
,, The teacher won't think less of you. Teachers want to hear questions. Look at it this way: those who ask questions demonstrate an engagement with the material and a desire to understand it better. If you're nonverbal, you can ask questions via email, written notes, sign language, etc.

, Befriending other disabled people can be really helpful, since you can exchange coping tips and sympathize with each other. However, don't limit your social circles either: consider making friends from other walks of life! Their perspective may teach you a lot about the world, just as you may have much to teach them. Girls and boys, blacks and whites, special and non-specials should all be friends.

, Being different is hard sometimes, but it also means that you have a lot to offer. Neurodiversity is a blessing to the world.


There is no shame in things that come along with disabilities, either: therapy, IEPs, asking for accommodations, etc. You face challenges that most of your peers don't, and these are tools that help you overcome and minimize them. You are okay the way you are.

,, For example, the Autism Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN) and the Autistic Women's Network, both of which are run by autistic people, teach self-advocacy skills and ways to adjust to a neurotypical world. The autism community also has a large network of bloggers and social network users. These people can teach you.

,, For example, if you have trouble making friends, it may be good to recognize that you will never have an enormous social circle like your dad's. This frees you from constantly spending energy on pointless tasks. Pick your priorities, and realize that sometimes it's okay to quit. This will give you more energy to focus on school and things that make you happy. You don't have to match other people's expectations.

, They are here to help you.


However, if you are being abused, speak out. You do not deserve abusive therapy, and the fact that you're disabled doesn't make it okay. Therapists should never hold you down, coerce you, hit you, pinch you, yell at you, withhold food, lock you in empty rooms, use electric shocks, or ignore you if you tell them that their tactics are distressing you.Tell someone if you're being hurt or mistreated. You don't deserve this, and you have every right to speak out.

, This is a way to know other students better, and learn more about your favorite interests. Following a career path related to your special interests is a way to become happy (and successful) for the rest of your life.

, Stimming helps many autistic people focus.However, make sure that any stimming or other activity you're doing is enhancing your learning, not distracting you from it. Pick something discrete and effective. If you're worried about disrupting other students' concentration, try stimming underneath your desk (e.g. holding a tangle in one hand on your lap or silently jiggling your feet).

, There's nothing wrong with asking for accommodations to help you do well in class. Doctors and therapists can offer suggestions of things that would help you. Things such as clear written instructions, extra time on tests, bringing you laptop to take notes, and a classroom aide are all examples of reasonable accommodations.


If you are denied necessary accommodations, talk to the school about it. You have the right to an education.

, With things like therapy, meltdowns, sensory overload, and the regular trials of family life, life can be hectic at times. Completing your homework right away can help take some of the load off your chest. And if it turns out that your day is open, then that means you have free time for the rest of the afternoon!

, Explain that while you are disabled, you aren't any younger than your peers, and they can treat you like the young adult that you are. A lot of disability rhetoric focuses on parents, which means that sometimes people forget that autism and other disabilities don't vanish when the person reaches age 18. If you have trouble with difficult face-to-face conversations, try scripting what you want to say, or writing a letter or email.

, Dealing with non-disabled people can be rough. They may make you feel useless or inferior. Remember that disability stereotypes say nothing about you, only about the people who create them.

, You are a strong and intelligent student, special needs and all.

Teachers will be very happy to help you if you have any doubt.;
, Always be polite to them. Never make fun of them and always obey them. Paying attention to whatever the teacher says and submitting the home works and projects given by the teacher on time are great ways of showing respect towards them.

In many ways, school is a sort of training ground for the work ethic and personal responsibilities that you'll need to develop in order to live successfully as an adult. You wouldn't last very long at a job if you were constantly unprepared, late, or calling in sick, so start taking school just as seriously.Show up to every class on time and always come prepared. Make sure you've done the homework and reading assignments, and that you have everything you'll need for class that day.
Sit in the front of the class room and be involved in class. Listen actively, respond to questions, and ask questions if there's any material you're confused or uncertain about.;
, Your notes are the building blocks of your study sessions later in the semester. Without strong notes, you may end up doing very poorly on your exams. Start by doing the reading every night and coming to class with a working knowledge of the material you'll be discussing that day.Start each day's notes on a fresh page in your notebook and write down the date and most recent reading assignment. This will help you track the material as you prepare for exams.
Write anything that your instructor puts on the board. These notes are usually very important and often quoted verbatim on quizzes or tests.
You don't have to write out every word your instructor says - this may not even be possible, depending on the class. Instead, write down the major points, like any important names, dates, events, relevant details, and results/implications.
Try to develop a system of abbreviations that works for you. Writing your notes in short-hand can help you take notes faster and with greater efficiency.

, It can help to rewrite the day's notes later in the day in a separate notebook. Rewriting helps you process the information and can help you have a cleaner, more organized set of notes from which to study.


You may also find questions or inconsistencies in the days' notes that you can ask your teacher to clarify the next day.

, In addition to rewriting your notes from class, it's important to review those notes and build off of them as you complete that class's reading assignments. Some studies suggest that reviewing your notes within 24 hours of class can significantly improve your retention of that information.Try writing questions in your notes. Interrogating the material, rather than simply glossing over it, will help you commit that information to memory and develop stronger critical-thinking skills.

, Managing your time will significantly help you become a better student and a more-productive worker. Time-management skills are highly valued by teachers and employers alike, and they can help ensure that you never miss a deadline or fail to prepare for an exam.Use a calendar or planner to help you keep track of deadlines, appointments, and other obligations.
Don't procrastinate. You won't actually buy yourself any time, and you'll just be even more stressed later on.
Break your tasks down into smaller, more manageable parts. This can help make a big project much easier to accomplish.Have a timeline for the things you need to accomplish and work on those tasks in a logical order. Decide which tasks are a priority and which tasks/projects need to be completed before the next can be started.

, Every instructor designs exams differently. If your teacher hasn't specified how he or she arranges tests/exams and which material will be covered, you'll need to ask your teacher outside of class. That way you'll be able to adequately prepare for the test more efficiently.


Start studying early. Avoid procrastinating and cramming right before a test/exam.
Try to understand the material both broadly and precisely. Start out with the general concept and work towards understanding the details of each subject.
Test yourself as you study to determine which subject areas need more work. Use flash cards to review terms/names/dates, then design a self-quiz to see if you have a firm grasp on the material.

, Whether you missed an important class, have trouble with certain concepts, or are dealing with a stressful family emergency, there's a chance that your grades might slip at some point. If this happens, it's important to get help right away. Remember that you don't have to resign yourself to bad grades if you're proactive and dedicated to your studies.


Keep track of your grade in the course and recognize patterns of poor grades. Your instructor may not address your grades unless you bring them up.Set up a meeting with your professor as soon as possible. Explain your situation (if you have a compelling one) and ask your instructor to help explain the material you're struggling with.Try working with a tutor if you're really struggling with an important concept. You may be able to find a tutor through your school, or you can find one in your area by searching online.

, If you fail to finish your homework, turn in a paper on time, or show up to your job on time, it's no one's fault but your own. Accepting responsibility is a major mark of maturity, in part because owning your obligations can help you stay focused and committed to what needs to be done in the future.

Give credit for any sources you use in your homework and assignments. Never plagiarize or steal intellectual/creative property from others.
Finish your assignments on time, and give yourself a few extra days to review the final product and make any necessary revisions.
Respect the ideas, beliefs, and opinions of others, even if you disagree with them.
Always conduct yourself in a respectful and appropriate manner, and never make excuses for your behavior. Taking responsibility involves both the good and the bad outcomes of your choices.

, Holding down a job while you're a student can be tricky, no matter what level of education you're at. It requires a lot of time management and prioritization. However, it's ultimately a very rewarding experience that can teach you a lot of fiscal responsibility while giving you a little extra spending money to have fun with your friends. Even if you can't realistically work full time, having a part-time job can still teach you a lot and prepare you for future responsibilities.Find a job that's willing to work with your school schedule. Not all employers are flexible, so let them know up front that your education is a priority.
Manage your time. Make sure you don't put off homework or projects until after work, as you may be too tired to do homework after a long shift.
Try to stay balanced. Make some time on weekends or after school on weekdays to do fun things you enjoy like spending time with friends.
Figure out a realistic budget that balances your expenses against your income and stick to that budget.
You can find budget planning help online, or by talking to a guidance counselor at your school., As you think about your future after you graduate, you'll need to begin setting your sights on a career. The main factors you should consider are whether you would enjoy working a given job day after day and whether that job can realistically sustain you. Look into employment statistics for that job, average starting salaries, any additional training/certification you may need, and whether you would need to relocate in order to work that job.


You can find current information on many different careers by reading through the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website.You can also try talking to working professionals in the field you're considering.

, Whether you're planning for college or are currently attending college, you may be looking into student loans. Loans are a great way to pay for your education, but they often come with steep interest rates that can saddle you with debt for years to come. Before you take out any loans or renew your existing loans, think about the long-term costs and look for other options that might be more financially sound.The general rule of thumb for students is that any loans you'll need to repay each month should not exceed eight percent of your anticipated gross monthly income.
Think about what your anticipated career is, and look into what someone just entering that field can realistically expect to make each month in their first year of employment.
If you're in college or planning on attending college, look into financial aid that you won't have to repay. For example, try to get any grants, scholarships, and work-study positions your school offers.
If you won't be able to afford your loan repayment, think about other alternatives to taking out a loan. You can work a second job, try to pay off your finances in installments, or ask a trusted friend or relative to lend you the money.

, Internships are a great way to gain valuable skills while you're still in school. Both internships and networking events can often lead to employment opportunities once you've established yourself and made connections in your desired field.


Many schools offer internships to students. If not, you can find internships in your area by searching online or reading through the classifieds section in your local paper.
Find out about networking events by joining relevant clubs and talking to working professionals in your desired field.

, Eating a balanced diet is essential for building strong muscles and bones, maintaining a healthy weight, and having enough energy to get through the day. A healthy meal should balance fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat or fat-free dairy. You should also try to avoid saturated fat, sodium, and sugar.Girls under age 13 should aim for around 2,000 calories each day, while boys in the same age range should aim for approximately 2,200 calories.Girls ages 14 to 18 should be getting approximately 2,300 calories each day, while boys in that age range should be getting around 3,000 calories.
Students age 19 and up should aim for around 2,400 calories each day for women and around 3,000 calories each day for men.

, It's generally recommended that adolescents should get at least one hour of physical activity each day, with the majority of that time devoted to moderate- to high-intensity aerobic exercise.

Adolescents should also engage in muscle-strengthening exercise sessions at least three days each week, though many aerobic activities build muscle while working the cardiovascular system.Bicycle riding, jumping rope, walking, jogging/running, and most organized sports are excellent forms of exercise for adolescents and young adults.
If you're pressed for time, even just 20 to 30 minutes of vigorous walking or jogging can help relieve stress and burn calories., It's essential for growing bodies to get enough sleep and to get quality sleep every night. Teenagers generally need 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night, though some may need even more sleep. Young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 generally need seven to nine hours of sleep each night, though some may need up to 11 hours of sleep. Listen to your body and adjust your schedule if you're chronically tired or easily fatigued.Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening to get a better night's sleep. Alcohol can also disrupt your sleep, so try to drink in moderation (if you're of legal drinking age) or avoid alcohol altogether.
Turn off all electronic devices, including cellphones, tablets, computers, and televisions, at least 30 minutes before bed.The glow of electronic screens can disrupt your body's production of melatonin, making it harder to sleep at night.
Find something relaxing to do before bed every night, such as reading, meditation, or exercise. Be aware, though, that exercise may wake some people up, and might be best reserved for the morning.
Stick to the same sleep schedule every day, even on weekends and days off. That means going to bed at the same time each night and getting up at the same time every morning.

, Drugs and alcohol can impair your ability to succeed in school, affect your performance at work, and potentially get you into trouble with the law. Many people end up making poor decisions while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, and prolonged use can lead to dependence, addiction, and other health problems., Tobacco is often used as a stress reliever, but it is actually a stimulant. Tobacco use can affect your ability to sleep at night, and prolonged use can lead to serious health problems like cancer and respiratory ailments.Even second-hand smoke from others can cause health problems over time. It's best to avoid smoke altogether to protect your health.

Eat less during breaks.,
Avoid daydreaming.,
Sit close to the tutor.,
Ditch all devices.,
Take notes.,
Get plenty of sleep each night.",How to Be Attentive in End of Day Classes," Having a heavy stomach after lunch or dinner can cause you to feel drowsy as your body focuses in digesting food rather than concentrating on listening.

Have a light meal for dinner if you have evening classes. You can always eat something more substantial after class. A sandwich, a bowl of salad or a soup and roll are some good choices before an evening class.;
, This can be done by active participation in the class exercises and discussions. Have speaking notes in dot point form to help you keep involved in any discussion sessions., It will be easier to hear the tutor, see the lecture slides or board notes and it feels more involved than hiding away at the back of the class or lecture theater., These will distract you. If you're trying to text a mate, email a friend or earn gems in a game, you won't be paying attention to class. Which means you'll miss things that you have to catch up on later rather than hearing them right then., Note-taking is a great way to stay focused and alert as you are thinking in motion about what points to take down, listening and digesting at the same time. As an added bonus, you get some useful notes at the end of class.

If it's easier, you can record a lecture or class but remember, that's just one more thing you'll have to attend to later, listening to it again.

, It's easier to make it through a busy day when you've had sufficient sleep each night."

Be good in general.",How to Be a Good Student in a New School," If you are starting at the beginning of the school year, this means that you absolutely must do your summer reading. Even if you could get by without doing it at your old school, your new school might test you on it right away. Although summer reading isn't always the most fun thing in the world, it's much easier to tackle that summer reading assignment if you do your reading ahead of time. At the very least, you won't have a clueless look on your face when your teacher asks about the summer reading or math assignments.;
, If you have to attend a new student orientation where teachers are present, be sure to ask about what's expected from you academically.

, Even if you are an A+ student, neglecting your studies result in that horrible 64, or D- on that reading assignment you could've easily avoided had you studied. Try to study in a quiet area where you can concentrate and can't be disturbed.

, It may take more work to get an A at your new school than it did at your old one. Take their feedback seriously and use it to improve your work.

, Some schools expect you to be a more active participant and encourage students to ask more questions. In that case, try to match the participation level of your classmates. Even if it is uncomfortable at first, your teachers will respect you for making an effort. At the very least, try to raise your hand for something other than asking to go to the bathroom.

, Some schools, especially smaller private ones, have teachers who will grade you on your homework. You don't want to lose points for not doing homework or doing it poorly. At the very least, doing your homework will give you a better understanding of the material, it will give you a sense of what you need to improve on and you won't get in trouble.

, Some teachers are big fans of pop quizzes and as the new student, you won't have a sense of who they are. It helps to do as much preparation as you can.

, Behave well toward everyone -- even to that jerk who tripped you and made you land flat on your plate of beans at lunchtime. Do as Hiawatha did in the Native American days and be nice to everyone, even your enemies. Doing this will make you new friends, which means more fun for you!

, It can make you look like an idiot in front of your friends, crush, or teacher. It can also get you in big trouble.

, This is easier to do if you avoid hanging out with people who make you feel uncomfortable or who just don't like. Give yourself some leeway to make mistakes, but be sure to learn from each and every one.

Disguise fruits or vegetables.",How to Pack Healthier School Lunches," Including a source of lean protein in your child's lunch is essential. Protein will provide them with the energy to pay attention during the day, support muscle and tissue development and metabolism.Leaner protein sources are preferable to high fat, highly processed or fried protein. Lean protein is lower in calories and fat which makes it fit well into a balanced diet.Include 1 – 3 ounces of protein in your child's lunch. They only need about 4 – 6 oz of protein total each day.Offer a wide variety of lean protein to help expand your child's palate and provide them with a larger variety of nutrients. Try: seafood, poultry, eggs, lean beef, beans, nuts, or tofu.
Options to try include: a hard boiled egg, lean deli meat or tuna salad on a whole wheat mini bagel, 1/2 cup of oven-fried tofu bites, or two deli meat and cheese roll-ups.;
, Both fruits and vegetables are essential part of a child's diet. They provide valuable amounts of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants to support healthy growth and development.


Include a 1/2 cup serving of both a fruit and a vegetable each day in your child's lunch.Include a variety of items throughout the week to expand your child's palate and preferences to these sometimes, tricky to eat foods.
If you're purchasing canned fruit, fruit cups or frozen fruit, choose items that are packed in water or 100% juice instead of syrups. For vegetables, choose canned or frozen items without added salt, gravies or sauces.

, Although dairy foods are typically considered part of the ""lean protein"" food group, they should be considered as a separate food group for children.


Dairy foods contain high amounts of calcium and Vitamin D which are essential for healthy bone growth. Unlike adults, children have the ability to continue increasing their bone density as they age. Calcium is essential for this important process to occur.Children need a total of 2 – 3 cups of dairy foods during the day. Including one serving at lunch can help your child meet this goal.Most children above age 2 or 3 years old, do not need full fat milk or yogurt. Go for or low-fat options for younger children, and low-fat or fat-free options for older children for your child's dairy foods.
Choose a variety of items like: milk, cheese, yogurt and cottage cheese.

, Like other food groups, including the most nutritious source of grains, like breads, wraps, pastas or rice, will boost the overall nutrition of your child's lunch.


Include 2 – 3 ounces of grains in your child's lunch. They only need about 4 – 8 total each day.100% whole grains are a preferable choice for your child's lunch. These grains are minimally processed, contain higher amounts of fiber, protein and other nutrients that will support your child's growth.Instead of items like white bread, plain flour tortillas, white rice or plain pasta, go for 100% whole grain options. Try whole wheat bread and tortillas, brown rice or quinoa, whole grain oats, or whole wheat pasta.
Some children might not like the look of whole grains or their more intense flavor. Try ""white"" whole grain foods to help disguise these nutritious grains in their diet.

, Like adults, children need to drink adequate amounts of fluids everyday to keep their little bodies hydrated.


Most children need about 5 – 8 cups of water or other hydrating beverages each day.This amount may change if your child is more active or plays a sport, it's a hot or humid day and how old they are.
Children truly only need to drink either water or low-fat milk. Try packing a small 8 oz water bottle or low fat milk box (similar to a juice box) in your child's lunch. Freezing them in advance can help your child's lunch stay cold in their locker or cubby.
Skips sodas (even diet), fruit juices, sports drinks or smoothies. These generally have a lot of additives and sugar which children do not need.

, Even though you may want to make your child's lunch super nutritious and healthy, remember they're still a kid and should enjoy the occasional treat.


When you're including a sweet or salty treat in your child's lunch, take advantage of nutritious foods they already enjoy. For example, if they love fruit, use fruit in sweet treats or if they love nuts, use those as part of a salty snack.
Nutritious sweet treats for kids can include: fruit with a peanut butter yogurt dip, brownies or muffins made with zucchini and whole wheat flour or whole wheat pita chips with fruit salsa.
Better salty snacks can include: homemade tortilla chips and hummus, homemade trail mix with roasted nuts and dried fruit or baked sweet potato fries with low-sugar ketchup.

, Processed foods should be limited for children (and adults). These foods are generally high in calories, sugar, fat, sodium and other additives.Try to avoid these foods as often as possible.


Avoid typical processed foods like: pre made lunch packs (with deli meat, cheese and crackers), juice cocktails or sports drinks, sweet pastries like cakes or cookies, chips and candy.
It can be difficult to avoid processed foods in your child's lunch - especially if they're asking for certain foods or many of their friends eat these types of foods.
An occasional processed food item is fine and shouldn't be a cause for worry. However, try making similar items at home or from scratch so your child can enjoy these items, but without all the additives. For example, if your child is asking for chips, consider making baked whole wheat tortilla chips at home and packing those instead of regular potato chips.

, When you get your child involved in prepping and packing their lunches, they may be more likely to try new things and eat the foods that are packed.Children love to help. Take advantage of this when you have more time and allow them to participate in the packing of their lunch.
If children feel they have some ""say-so"" over what goes into their lunch, they may be more likely to eat all the foods that are packed.
Also, if you allow your children to prep or cook certain parts of their lunch, they are more likely to try new foods., Many schools are teaching kids about nutrition on a regular basis. A common teaching theme is to ""eat the rainbow."" This fun trick teaches kids to eat foods from each color group everyday.


""Eating the rainbow"" is a great idea to follow. When you eat foods that are all different colors, you're expanding the amount of vitamins and antioxidants in your or your child's diet.If your kids are learning about healthy eating or nutrition in school, try to keep up with those themes with foods in their lunches. If they're learning about different fruits, pack some of those items in their lunch. Or if they're supposed to try a new fruit or vegetable, allow them to choose something new at the store.
In addition, including many bright and vibrant colors in your child's lunch may be more visually appealing and tempting to your child's senses., Remember that children might have some difficulty eating or preparing certain foods in their lunches. If it's difficult or they cannot do it by themselves, they are more likely to ditch the food.All foods need to be easy to eat. Don't expect kids to put much work into their lunches. Plus, many lunch sessions are short and rushed and don't allow children much time.
For example, peel your child's orange, wash and chop raw veggies, wash and slice a raw apple, quickly blanch raw vegetables to help make them easier to chew, or cut sandwiches in half or quarters.

, Kids will always go for ""fun to eat"" foods or foods that are stimulating visually.Include ""finger foods"" in your child's lunch. Finger foods are fun for children and are easy to eat. Include items like: grapes, blackberries, segmented oranges, baby carrots, small cut raw vegetables with dip or small cubes of cheese.
Make cutouts of their sandwiches using cookie cutters. Make sandwiches and then use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes out of their sandwich. You can also make ""sushi"" by rolling their favorite sandwich fillings into a whole wheat wrap and slicing it into small individual rounds.
Make fruits and vegetables fun as well. Try: making fruit kabobs or skewers, make homemade veggie chips, make sweet potato fries or ""tots"", or create animal figures with fruits or vegetables.

, Although many kids will love fruit kabobs or homemade vegetable chips, there are many kids that won't go near these nutritious foods no matter how exciting they are.


Work to sneak in more vegetables into your child's diet. If they don't see them or taste them, they're more likely to eat them.Blend or puree vegetables into foods. Blend vegetables into sauces like tomato or pizza sauce, cheese sauce for mac and cheese or use pureed vegetables in a soup base.
You can also shred vegetables into baked goods like meatballs, meatloaf, casseroles or sweet baked goods.
Another easy way to get in fruits and vegetables is by making your child a fun smoothie. Mix yogurt, milk, spinach and pineapple into a morning breakfast ""green monster drink"" for a fun and sneaky way to get in some extra nutrition.

You may want to wear one main color (e.g. blue or pink) along with a few light, dull, or neutral colors., Wear something comfortable and well-fitting, such as a T-shirt and jeans. Don't wear a suit or a dress or anything expensive looking, because that will definitely make people notice you.Avoid wearing baggy, revealing, overly fashionable, or brightly-colored outfits, as it will draw attention to you.
Find a personal style that feels comfortable, suits you, and blends in nicely with the rest of the students.

, If it's going to rain, wear something with a hood. If it's warm out, definitely don't wear a jacket, because you'll really stand out when everyone else is wearing shorts and tanks., Put away that bold statement jewelry. Avoid sporting necklaces with big beads or dangling earrings, and stick to only one or two minimalistic pieces of jewelry with your outfit., Don't dye your hair bright colors or style it in crazy hairdos; this will only make people notice you more! Usually people dye or style their hair when they want to be noticed. Wear your hair in a neat, plain hairdo that's also flattering around your facial features., For example, don't carry your iPod or wear your headphones while you're walking down the hall. You may be drawing more attention to yourself or to your stuff than you think., Don't act as though you're frantically trying to get somewhere, but don't walk too slowly, either. Walk the way you normally would at home or in your neighborhood.Walk with a purpose, as if you're meant to be doing something and you don't look out of place., Raise your hand occasionally (if at all), and try to avoid answering questions unless called upon. Pay attention, though, so if you are called upon you know the answer to the question and avoid looking flustered. Sit in the middle or back of the classroom, and focus your attention on the teacher.


If participation counts towards your grade, then raise your hand enough to get a grade that you are satisfied with.

, Share personal news (e.g. breakups, successes) within your small social circle, rather than announcing them to the world. Do your best to present a serene face to the outside world, and save your inner struggles for a few close friends, family members, or trusted adults who can listen and keep a secret.

, If you don't want to be noticed between classes, like during lunch, then study or do your homework during this time. Students study in school, so it's not like you're doing something out of the ordinary.

, Find friends who share your interests. Don't feel like you need to slip off the radar altogether; school becomes much easier if you have the support of like-minded friends. Find a group that is fun and relaxing to hang out with, and stick together so you don't look like a loner.Don't feel like you need to avoid meeting people altogether! If someone seems nice, go right ahead. It would be rude not to reciprocate.

, Don't hang out with people who are always getting thrown into detention. These kind of people can get you into trouble, even if they don't mean to. Getting in trouble will definitely get you noticed, and not in a good way.

, Don't attend parties that everyone knows about and that are held by the most popular groups in school. Everyone talks about those parties, and you do not want your name linked up to them.


Go to your friends' parties, and people you usually hang around with. Do the same with school-related events. Stick to your own crowd, where you will be surrounded by others like you.
Small groups may be more fun for you than big parties.

, It can drain your energy, and the more effort you put into it, the more people will notice you online. Keep most of your social interaction in person, or on anonymous websites that aren't connected with your school.

, Never gossip or talk trash about people, classes or events. This can deeply hurt others' feelings, and it will bring you to the forefront of their minds in a very bad way. If you don't like something or someone, try a shrug and a noncommittal ""It's okay"" or ""She and I don't really click, so I don't hang out with her much.""

Break time is a great time to make friends. If you see someone doing the same thing you like go over and say ""Hi"". Talking to people is one of the best ways.
Don't worry about being popular, or hanging out with the popular kids. Worry about hanging out with who you like, and avoid the people you don't.
Try also getting a best friend so you can have someone who really understands you.;
, Another great way to make friends is by joining a formal club or group at your school. For instance, you could join the music club, chess club, and even the dancing club. Check out the options offered at your school and consider joining one that lines up with your hobbies.


If none of the clubs sound appealing, consider starting one at your school. For example, you could have an after school video game club, or a Magic: The Gathering group. Once you have come up with your group and determined how it will benefit your school, you will need to find a teacher to sponsor it, or start it yourself with some friends.
Try joining a club that you have no interest in, in order to meet some people you might not meet normally. Even if you're not a great singer, try making the school choir work for you. Use it as a chance to socialize and make friends.

, Some schools offer team sports that allow you to compete against other schools and make friends with your fellow students. Most of the students have never played before, so it's more or less an even playing field at most schools. Soccer, track and field, basketball, and football can all make school a little more fun.


If you don't want to play sports, consider attending the games and cheering on your team with your friends. Most of the time, you can get in for free, and it can be a great way of making new buddies.
Sports aren't for everyone, and students sometimes overemphasize the need for playing sports. It can be a great way to learn skills, make friends, and have fun, or it can be a needless source of stress. It is not recommended to play games that add to your stress; only play games that you enjoy.

, You could take a practical joke personally and get your feelings hurt, or you could laugh it off and start planning your response joke, and make it an epic one. One way to make friends is by being less serious at school and learning to cut loose every now and then. School shouldn’t be your dungeon. It can be a great place to have fun too. Expect that you'll have fun and you'll start having fun and making friends.


Kids like to be friends with kids who seem fun and funny, not kids who seem serious or angry. If you want to make friends, you should be loose and comfortable.

, You could wake up each morning with a bad attitude and each morning will turn into a bad day. Or, you could crank up some energetic tunes, eat a breakfast of champions, and make your school day epic. If you decide that your day will be fun, it likely will be.


Pick a ""get up"" song to listen to each morning before school. You can even sometimes set an alarm on your phone or clock radio to play a particular song, so that the first thing you hear in the morning can be the tune that gives you energy and makes you happy. Forget that annoying buzzer.
Try to eat a good breakfast each day, to make sure you have the energy to get through the day. Focus on healthy fruits and whole grains, avoiding overly processed and sugary items like Pop Tarts or sugar-bomb cereal. You could eat an apple for instance.

, If it makes you happier and more comfortable with your environment, try decorating your backpack, binder, notebook, locker, and other supplies necessary for school. Use stickers, glitter pens, your favorite band's emblem, or other stuff to make your school things a little more fun to carry around with you.

, Trends go in and out, so it's hard to say what the coolest clothes will be at any given time. However, enjoying school doesn't necessarily mean wearing the latest and the greatest mall wear. Wear the clothes that you feel comfortable wearing, and the clothes that allow you to cut loose and have fun at school.


If it helps, plan out your school clothes the night before, so you can make sure you have everything that you'll need, clean and ready to go, for the morning. Learn to do laundry yourself so that you won't have to worry about whether or not your favorite shirt is clean.

, It's a fact: sometimes school is going to be boring. You will have to sit through a few lectures and while away a few dull hours of waiting. You can use your imagination to make it more fun, though!

Imagine school as an RPG with you at the helm, or a story being written with you as both writer and protagonist. Cast yourself as a secret agent, sent to school to report back on the activities of these local youth. Find some way to add a little spice to the dullness.







, One of the most stressful and frustrating parts of school can be making sure you have everything that you're supposed to have. Where's your English homework? Where's that math assignment? Is your pencil sharp? The less you have to worry about these little things, the more you'll be able to focus and enjoy school. Be prepared for class and everything will be easier.


Get a good binder to organize your notes and homework assignments. Put each important document into it when you receive it, and regularly clean it out so junk doesn't build up. If you've got a bunch of old assignments in there, throw them out.
Keep a homework journal, or keep a daily planner up to date. Do this so that you will never be caught off guard with a homework assignment you forgot about. Keep close track of due dates so you'll stay ahead of the game.

, Teachers are like students: some are great, and some are less than great. However, teachers are always the ones in charge of the classroom, and even if you're feeling frustrated or bored in class, you should choose to be nice to your teachers, and chances are that they will be nice back to you. That makes everyone's day a whole lot easier.


It may seem like talking in class and cutting up with your friends while the teacher is talking will make class more fun, but in the long run, it might make it a whole lot more stressful and boring with a bad grade and a detention.
If you have a ""reputation"" at your school for being a class clown or troublemaker, you might have an uphill battle, but you can still make a change. Wait after class and tell your teacher that you're trying and you want to do better. Ask your teacher how you can do better in class and avoid getting into trouble. He or she will be impressed that way.

, Homework will be a lot less of a burden if you save enough time to get it finished completely. Eliminate the worry and stress of homework by starting it early and getting it done quickly instead of waiting until the last minute. Wouldn't the morning before school be a lot less stressful if you weren't scrambling to finish your work? Wouldn't the school day be more fun without worrying that you'll get a bad grade?


Say you have one month before you need to turn in a big project. You could put it all off until the last night, or you could spend 30 minutes on your project each night. That does not take much much time, but it is a lot less stressful than completing six hours of work straight at the last minute., If you're struggling in school, don't try to take it all on by yourself. Make it easy. Ask for help at school by joining an after-school study group, or going to the tutoring center if your school has one.


Ask your parents or older siblings for help. Since they have most likely gone through the same subjects at school as you did, they will be a great help. Use your family as a resource for help with school subjects.
Ask your teacher if you can stay 10-15 minutes after school to ask a few questions about your homework, if you're embarrassed to ask during class. It's always better to ask than to be confused.

, If you're feeling bored and uninspired at school, or are getting bad grades and acting out, it might be because you're not being challenged by the material. School might be more fun if it was challenging your mind more with engaging material that's closer to your interests. Explore the options in your area and consider switching to an alternative school or finding out whether or not you might qualify for skipping a grade.


Private schools can be expensive, but you may also qualify for scholarships or financial aid. You will never know until you find out what options are available in your area.
If your parents are unwilling to explore the options with you, talk to your guidance counselor or a teacher that you get along with. Tell them how you're feeling and ask for help.

, It might seem like sneaking an iPod into your sweatshirt would be a great way of having fun at school, but it also risks getting you into trouble, and forcing you to fall behind when you're not paying attention. It may not seem like it, but the best way to enjoy the lessons you're learning in school is to listen more closely, not find ways to distract yourself.It may sound corny, but pretend like there's going to be some really critical bit of information in your math teacher's problem. Pretend it's not multiplication that you're learning, but complicated formulas to build robots. Use your imagination to find some way to stay focused.

Always think things out beforehand.,
Know your environment.Learn the layout of your school.,
Know your enemy.Study your teachers and other staff.,
Maintain cover.Be a good student!,
Weigh the risks versus the rewards.",How to Get Away With Stuff at School1," Think of yourself as a master criminal, like an art thief. Do the best art thieves just decide on the spot to grab a painting off the wall and run for it? No! They plan every detail well in advance. So do the same and know exactly what you are going to do before you do it.Acting rashly leaves you wide open and exposed. You don’t know who is watching or who will be coming around the next corner.
Every now and then you might get away with something that you did purely on impulse. Consider yourself lucky.
Don’t assume that everything will work out exactly the same way twice just because you got away with it once.;
, Don’t limit yourself to just the basics, like where the cafeteria or library is. Note every nook and cranny, too, like that spot under the stairs in A-wing’s stairwell, which hardly anyone passes because the fire exit there faces the woods instead of the parking lot. Have a perfect working knowledge of where to find the best place to get away with stuff unobserved.


Find out where each exit is. Also note whether the doors have alarms that will ring when opened.
Check for blind spots. Scan the ceilings and upper walls for cameras and mirrors. Make a mental note of any spots hidden from view.
Note which halls are patrolled by hall monitors and how frequently.
Make a mental map of the outside grounds as well. Note which areas are wide open to view from the school's windows, and which are covered by trees, bushes, and other structures.

, Learn their habits and schedules. Get a sense of how strict and observant they are in general. Note if they tend to get more upset over very specific infractions (like cheating) while letting other bad behavior slide (like being five minutes late). These are the people you need to sneak around, so plan your actions around them.


Pay attention to how your teachers act in class. Do they walk up and down the aisles a lot? Do they stick to the blackboard in front? Do they mostly sit at the desk or do they remain standing with a better view of the class before them?
Use bathroom breaks to note which teachers monitor which halls. Do they spend that time grading papers with their noses glued to the page? Or do they actively walk the halls, on the lookout?
If you have to sign in for the bathroom, note which teachers are assigned to which bathrooms. Learn which bathrooms are assigned to teachers of the opposite gender, so they are less likely to enter while you’re in there.
Don’t forget the other adults who work there! Pay attention to the maintenance people, cafeteria staff, grounds crew, and office workers, too.
Pay attention to schoolmates who might rat on you, too. For example, if your arch-nemesis is seated right beside you in class, asking for your classmates for help during tests may be much more risky.

, Remember: you want to get away with stuff, not be known as the “bad kid.” Earn the trust of your teachers and the other staff. Convince them that your consistent good behavior is never going to change. This way they are less likely to notice when it does!


Having straight A’s can help you look like a good student, but grades aren’t everything. Whether you ace tests without even trying or struggle to earn okay grades, remember that your behavior is most important.
Impress your teachers as someone who is really invested in their schoolwork and takes it seriously, even if school isn’t your strong point.
Turn assignments in on time. Take notes in class. Participate in discussions. Get to class before the bell. Ask for help from your teachers if you’re having trouble.
Treat your schoolmates with respect to avoid being known as a ""bad kid,"" even if you're a straight-A student.

, Before you do anything, ask yourself if it is really worth it. Be aware that punishment will vary according to your offense, your school's policies, your parents' attitudes, and even the law. Find out exactly what you might be in for if you get caught, and then reconsider moving forward. For instance:


Being late to class might only get your written up.
Cutting class may land you in detention right away.
Skipping school will give you one less day that you can be considered absent without repercussions (even if no one catches you).
Smoking cigarettes on campus might get you suspended.
Offenses that are considered actual crimes (like smoking marijuana) might get you expelled or even in trouble with the police.

"
"
Prepare for the worst.,
Deal with every scenario.,
Review your plans yet again.",How to Get Away With Stuff at School2," Whatever it is you intend to do, assume you will get caught. Improve your chances of succeeding by knowing each and every way that you could possibly fail. Brainstorm every single way this might happen. For instance:If you plan on skipping school, the school may call your parents to let them know you are absent. Also, you may need to turn in a doctor’s or parent’s note the next day. Plus, any neighbors who stay home during the day may notice you doing the same.
If you’re cutting class, your escape to the parking lot might be in full view of classroom and office windows. If you do get away, you might bump into teachers or other staff who left campus for lunch break. In the meantime, your teacher that period might check the school’s absentee roll.
If you cheat on a test, your teacher may spend the test period patrolling the aisles. They may also instruct you to put all of your belongings in your bookbag, meaning that hiding a cheat sheet will be tougher. And even though your fellow classmates may want to help, they may be unsubtle about it and get you both into trouble.

, Start sketching out different plans that address each way you could possibly get caught. You may not find one that addresses them all, but try for it, anyway. Decide on which plan is the most foolproof. Don’t discard the others, though. Keep them as backup plans in case Plan A falls through.If you’re skipping school, consider these different actions: asking your parents directly for a mental health day; faking an illness; calling the attendance office in the morning and posing as your parent before the school calls them; putting a show on for the neighbors by leaving for school and then running back home as if you’re sick.When cutting class, think about: only skipping classes during lunch periods when kids are allowed to leave campus; avoiding businesses and other public spaces; risking a write-up for being late to homeroom so you end up on the absentee roll.
To cheat on a test, consider: using items that you are allowed (like tissues, beverage labels, or even your pen) to write or hide cheat sheets; writing answers on your skin and using clothes to hide them; training beforehand to read cheat sheets quickly while the teacher’s back is briefly turned; training with your friends so everyone is comfortable.

, Leave as little to chance as possible. Go over your plans with a fine tooth comb. Make sure that you aren’t forgetting anything. Try to think of any details, no matter how small or random, that might trip you up.Remember, your teachers can hit or miss, but you can’t miss, not even once! Think about things like:


Whether any special events (like assemblies or book fairs) are scheduled that day, which might disrupt the school’s normal flow.
Any student-teachers, special speakers, principals or other higher-ups, or any other new people who might be observing your class soon.
If a change in weather might spoil your plans (like, say, a sudden rainstorm soaking you wet when you cut class to hang out behind the football field)."
"
Keep it to yourself.Remember that the first step in getting caught is sharing your secret.,
Include as few people as possible.,
Pick the right time.,
Be slick.,
Lay the groundwork for your cover and excuses.",How to Get Away With Stuff at School3," Even if you have come up with the most brilliant sure-fire plan ever, put your pride aside and seal those lips. Avoid the risk of someone else spoiling your fun with their own loose lips. This goes for both before and after.


Telling someone else about what you’re going to do might inspire them to do the same. Trouble is, they might not have thought things out as much as you. Then, when they get caught, the adults know what to look for.
Bragging about it afterward is just as bad. Remember: gossip travels fast, and you could get busted. And even if the school can’t prove what you did, they now know to keep their eye on you in the future.

, Whatever you’re doing, if you can do it by yourself, then do it by yourself. Don’t run the risk of someone else getting caught and spilling the beans. Even if you trust them to not tattle, keep in mind that they still might brag to other kids about what you got away with. If you have to make it a team effort, then:Keep your numbers small. Only include your most trusted friends. Swear them to secrecy so no one outside your circle knows what you’re up to.
Keep your best tricks to yourself. Let’s say that hidey-hole at the back of your locker is key to your plan. But does anyone else need to know it’s there? Probably not.

, Just because you have a near-perfect plan, don’t put it into action willy-nilly. Keep in mind that even the best laid plans can fail. Understand that there is ALWAYS a chance of being caught, even if you pulled this off once before. With that in mind, ask yourself whether the risk is worth taking today or if your plan would be better saved for another time. For example:If you’re skipping school or cutting class, consider what’s being taught that day. Can you afford to miss this lesson, or will skipping it put you behind?
If you have a substitute teacher, does that improve your chances? Or does this unknown person make your plans less certain?
If you’re about to cheat on a test, ask yourself how badly you need this grade. Would it be smarter to settle for a C today and save your master plan for when you really, really need a better grade?

, One of the best ways to avoid getting caught is to look like you aren’t doing anything wrong, so don’t act guilty!Imagine yourself as an adult who is watching you. Check yourself for any little thing that might call attention to yourself or give away what you are doing. Change your behavior, appearance, or gear as needed.


Walk at a relaxed pace, like you own the place, with your chin up and your eyes straight ahead. Avoid slouching or rushing, which shows that you have something to hide.Take nice, deep breathes in through your nose and out through your mouth to stay relaxed.Come up with innocent-looking signals to communicate, like curling your hair in your finger or raising your chin and scratching your neck.
Use your pen or pencil to tap messages back and forth, like three quick taps followed by two slow taps to ask for help with question 32 on your test.
Use doodles as a written code to hide your cheat sheet’s meaning. For example, with “2 + 2 = 4,” use triangles for “2,” a square for “4,” a circle for “+,” and a slash for “=.”

, If getting away with your stunt means changing anything major in your appearance or behavior, don’t wait until the last minute. Ease into it instead. Remember that you want to come across as acting normal, so if you need to act differently in order to succeed, let everyone get used to your new ""normal"" before putting your plan into action.If you know you’re going to skip the next school day, start acting a little sluggish and under the weather the day before.If you plan on cutting class later on in the day, maybe use the early morning to make a lot of emergency runs to the bathroom so it seems less odd if you don’t show up for class later.
If you intend to use tissues or a beverage label as a cheat sheet, start bringing them to class each day, not just the day of the test.
If you use doodles as code for cheat sheets, make a habit of always doodling in your notebooks and on your book covers, so it just looks like something you do to pass the time.

Calm and center yourself.,
Choose to remain silent.,
Check your nonverbal responses.,
Put the incident in perspective.",How to Ignore Annoying Classmates1," Annoying people tend to bring out the worst in us. When you feel yourself getting frustrated and overwhelmed by the actions of those around you, take a moment to compose yourself.


Take a long, deep breath in, followed by a slow exhale. Continue to take deep breaths until you feel in control of your words and actions.
As you breathe, you may find it helpful to repeat a simple mantra to yourself, such as “serenity,” “tolerance,” or “love.” Focus on your one word mantra instead of your annoying classmate.;
, When an annoying classmate intentionally, or perhaps unintentionally, pesters, teases, or provokes you, the only thing you have control over is how you respond. Don’t fuel their negative behavior with poor behavior of your own. Choose to remain silent. Silence is not equivalent to weakness or cowardliness. Rather, it can be the mark of a strong individual who has control over their emotions.While some situations benefit from inaction, others do require our attention. If a classmate is bullying you or others, stand up for what is right.

, In addition to expressing our annoyance with witty remarks and spiteful comments, our bodies also convey our annoyance with eye rolls, mutters, and disgruntled faces. If you are truly going to ignore your annoying classmate, you need to limit or minimize your physical response to their behavior too. Don’t groan, sigh, or roll your eyes when they do or say something that gets on your nerves., In the moment, it is easy to fixate on the annoying behaviors of others. Their quirks can consume our thoughts and drive us mad! To prevent yourself from overreacting, you must ask yourself this: does their annoying behavior negatively affect my life beyond this moment? Most of the time, the answer will be “no.”"
"
Do homework for another class.,
Write to-do-lists and weekly schedules.",How to Find Things to Do in a Boring Class1," This way, you’ll pass the time doing something constructive and you don’t have to worry about the homework later.


Ask your teacher whether it is okay to do the homework in their class. This only works if you are bored in class because you are not challenged.
Sit in the middle or in the last row. Try to stay as far away from the front of the class as you can.
Keep the materials for your other class out of your teacher’s sight.;
, This will give you a sense of doing something important in an otherwise boring environment and will look as if you are taking notes.Vary your to-do lists. Write down what to search for online later, or birthday gift ideas,or your top ten favorite things of any category (i.e. Bands, video games, TV shows, etc). This can really pass the time, deciding which of your favorite things make the list and which are left out.

Write down the song lyrics to your top five songs, your favourite quotes from a Videogame, TV show, Book, etc. It'll get you thinking for a while and passes time.


Divide your list up into goals, projects and tasks- this will give you an overview of how to spend your time outside of class. Write an imaginary schedule: Stuff such as Monday: Mass destruction of school books, Tuesday: World domination. Wednesday: fitting of mute button on all siblings and parents. Thursday: World domination again. Friday: Sleeping.

Imagine how your teacher would react if they saw what you have written down.

Pay no attention to the class clown.,
Limit your interactions with competitive students.,
Tune out chatterboxes.",How to Ignore Annoying Classmates2," Jokers, or class clowns, devote their time and energy to providing comic relief for the classroom. When you are in the mood for the class clown’s antics, their jokes are hilarious; when you are not in the mood, their attempts and humor can drive you mad. Since class clowns thrive on the reaction of their “crowd,” the best way to ignore a joker is to have no physical or verbal reaction to their jokes.


Class clowns aim to please and are highly sensitive to criticism. If you can not remain silent, a choice remark could put a temporary end to their comedy bit.If you get in trouble for something the class clown did, don’t overreact. Remain calm and ask the teacher to speak with you after class. When you are speaking one on one with the teacher, explain your side of the story and apologize for any inconvenience you may have caused. Work with your teacher to develop a plan on how to avoid situations like this in the future.

, Overly competitive students thrive on the knowledge that they are better than others. Their determination to prove themselves as superior students can leave others in the class feeling unintelligent and overlooked. If a competitive classmate asks you how you did on an assignment, they are just looking for chance to brag about their score. When this happens, just walk away. If their pestering persists, tell them that you prefer to keep your grades private.For example, you may say: “Sorry, I like to keep that kind of information to myself,” “You did really well on the test. Thanks for sharing your score; I prefer to keep mine private,” or “Please stop asking me. I am not comfortable sharing my grade with you.”

, Overly talkative classmates often struggle with self-awareness and egotism. Ignoring chatterboxes is extremely difficult. Their incessant chatter is inconsiderate and distracting. Try to tune them out and stay focused on the lecture or task at hand. If necessary, politely ask them to be quiet or speak softer.For instance, you may say: “I’m having a hard time hearing the teacher. Will you please lower your voice or stop talking?” or “Your talking is really distracting me. Can you stop talking so that I can focus?”
If you could not hear what your teacher said, raise your hand and ask them to repeat it. “Sorry, I missed what you said over all the chatter. Can you say that again, please?”
If you are at your wits end, seek help from your teacher. Stay after class and talk to your teacher about the chatterbox. Your teacher may rearrange the seating chart and or talk to the student privately.

Do not concern yourself with detached classmates.,
Remain patient with shy classmates.,
Occupy yourself when clueless classmates talk.",How to Ignore Annoying Classmates3," When the teacher devotes time to trying to engage a detached student, your classmate’s inability to actively participate can become annoying. While this can feel like a waste of time, you must remember that it is part of the teacher’s job. Instead of concerning yourself with this student’s disinterest, use the time to get homework done.


If you have to work with this student in a group setting, don’t waste your energy trying to get them to help. Instead, ignore them and do your best to compensate for their lack of participation.

, If you are partnered up with a shy student, you may find their struggle to interact with you annoying. Unlike the detached student, you can’t just ignore your shy classmate. Do your best to engage your partner in conversation.


Before you start on the project, try to get to know them first. If they feel connected and comfortable around you, they may be more inclined to talk.
Consider trying a few icebreakers.

Play a quick round of two truths and a lie. List two true statements and one lie about yourself. Your shy partner must guess which statements are true and what statement is false.
Tell a few jokes or riddles.
Ask your partner a series of random questions. These could include: what’s your favorite food, where were you born, what’s your favorite carnival ride, do you play any sports, or do you have a pet? Let your partner ask you a few random questions too!, While you may master content easily, others students might struggle to comprehend what they are learning. If you have a classmate that constantly asks for clarification, don’t shame them for trying to understand the material. As they talk to the teacher, do your best to check your verbal and physical responses. If you won’t benefit from the additional clarification, occupy yourself with other homework or activities.

Chew gum, or suck on hard candy.,
Draw or doodle things on notebook paper in the margins of notes.,
Look out of the window, or look around the classroom.,
Read magazines or novels.,
Sleep.",How to Find Things to Do in a Boring Class2," You'll still have to listen to the lessons, but you can have all sorts of fun manipulating the treat inside your mouth.


Find out if there is a no-food policy in your class.
Make the decision to chew or not- weigh the consequences of getting caught.
Put your piece of gum or candy in your mouth when your teacher is not looking.
Keep a straight face while enjoying your treat. You don’t want to give yourself away!

, Bring an empty notebook or some paper to class and use it as your drawing notebook or just use some binder paper. Not only does it occupy you, it can also indirectly boost your writing skills.Write everything on the board into your notebook- you will still need your notes, as there will be a test at some point.
Sit far from the teacher and tilt your notebook up- it will just look like you are taking notes.
Draw whatever shapes come to mind- geometric patterns, circles, blobs- most teachers won’t mind, as it keeps you occupied and you don’t disturb the class.
Look up and glance at the teacher every so often- it will give the impression that you are paying attention.

, This is another quiet way to pass the time- and what is more interesting than your fellow classmates?


Entertain yourself by counting how many students are wearing a school sweatshirt, how many have dyed their hair, etc.
Play classroom bingo with your neighbor. It's fun and hones your observation skills.Zone out, but but try to remember the last sentence your teacher said, just in case your teacher asks you to prove you were listening.

, They are often more engaging than the textbook, and you can disguise them easily.


Pick a book or magazine that is smaller or the same size as your textbook.
Hide the magazine behind the book, and read it.
Look up every once in a while, not only to feign interest, but also to check if the teacher makes rounds.
Find a way to hide your book or magazine quietly and elegantly before you get caught.

, This may not be distracting to others, but is truly rude towards your teacher. However, sometimes you’re short on your sleep.


Stay in the back of the room, if you can sit behind a bigger classmate, even better.
Try to hide behind a book.
Have a friend near who can wake you before your teacher notices.
If you get caught sleeping,then say you had a migraine or come up with an acceptable excuse.

Have your phone in reach- either in your pocket or under the table, but out of your teacher’s sight.
Put your phone on silent- if you put it on vibrate, people WILL hear (for most phones).
Text your friends without looking on your screen too much.
Look up into your teacher’s direction repeatedly, to feign interest and attention.

, The old fashioned version of text messages, time goes by quicker if you commiserate with friends.


Take a small piece of paper- either rip a piece out of the back of your notebook, or use pre-cut pieces of paper.
Write your message- keep the paper on your notebook so it looks as if you are taking notes.
Keep your message brief- you don’t have much space.
Make sure your teacher is not looking
Fold your message, write the recipient on the outside.
Pass it to your neighbor inconspicuously, who will pass it along.
Look into the other direction, and wait for a reply!
Consider learning Morse code and using that- it adds a layer of mystery to your notes.

, It is silent and a fun way to communicate.


Keep your hands low so the teacher doesn't see you.

, The art of folding paper will keep your hands and mind occupied in a boring class, and can actually help you concentrate after all!Familiarize yourself with the basic folding techniques.Start out with simple, fun shapes, such as a dog or a cat.Practice folding without looking too closely- that way you can always look up to your teacher and pretend you’re listening.
Keep and ear out for what your teacher is saying while you’re folding. If you get caught and can at least repeat their last words, the punishment may be less severe.
Fold slowly and quietly- origami paper can be quite loud.
Offer the cute origami animal to your crush- or to your teacher if you get caught!
Make a fortune teller once you are a bit more advanced, and play with your friends!, There are several fun ways to spin a coin, which can entertain you and your classmates.


Look for loose change in your pockets- quarters are best, but any coin will do.
Stand the coin under your right index finger, and flick it with the other index finger so that it spins.
Vary your methods. Try your right index finger, then your thumb, or let it roll of your hand., It’s a fun way to impress your friends and keep your hands occupied.


Start with an evenly weighted and smooth pen. Watch a tutorial before you go to class- you want to have an idea of what you are doing.Begin with simple balancing tricks, and then work your way to greater tricks.
Spin when your teacher is not looking at you- especially in the beginning, you will drop the pencil very often.

, You can play these on either your phone, or a small hand held device.Make sure your device is fully charged- you don’t want to run out of battery in the middle of your game.
Decide whether you want to play online with others (even your classmates) or just for your amusement.
Pick the game you want to play and have it ready by the time the class starts.
Turn all sounds off.
Keep your device hidden beneath the textbook. Under the table is another option, but it will strain your neck after a while.

,


Keep your mini skateboard in your pocket or your binder.
Build little ramps from pens and other books- your school supplies can serve as a mini-skatepark
Play with them on a notebook or a binder. This will soften the loud impact when they land.
Keep an eye on your teacher and put them right back in your pocket the moment they notice something.

,


Sit in the back of the room, if possible against the wall
Use small in-ear headphonesthat are not easily visible.
Try to listen with only one ear. Hiding only one headphone is easier and you can still somewhat pay attention.
Put the wires under your shirt or hide them under long hair.
Rest your head on your arm to cover the earphones even more.
Keep the volume low- you don’t want to get caught by blasting your music loudly.

, This is a creative way to keep you entertained for probably more than one boring class period.


Keep an extra notebook, that looks very similar to your class notebook.
Start by drawing out characters, plot lines, and story ideas.
Write the script and design your own battle system.
Write the game play sections as if you were writing a guidebook for others.

, This will probably only keep you occupied shortly, but it’s a fun way to express yourself and passes the time!


Decide which colors you want to use. Be creative; you could paint your nails in a pattern, or add little ornaments to the color.
Put a sheet of paper underneath your hand- you don’t want to stain your notes.
Slowly paint your nail in the chosen color.
Apply the sharpie or white-out in regular outward strokes.
Softly wave your hands in the air and wait for the color to dry.

Read the assigned material before you arrive to class.,
Get a coffee, tea or caffeinated beverage before class starts.,
Listen carefully to the teacher and follow along with the lesson.,
Participate and ask questions.",How to Find Things to Do in a Boring Class4," If you know what the teacher is talking about, the lecture will be less boring.


Print out the syllabus and, if they are available, the power-point slides for the class. This will help you keep track of when what assignments are due, and prepare accordingly.
Take notes on what you are reading.
Write down what you don't understand and ask the teacher about it in class.

, This will help you be attentive.


Check whether you are allowed to bring a beverage to class. If not, drink your coffee before class.
Know how much caffeine is enough to keep you alert. Every individual processes caffeine differently- so you don't want to be over-caffeinated and jittery.Drink the coffee at least ten minutes before the class starts. Caffeine takes effect as fast as ten minutes after the first sip, with alertness increasing 30-45 minutes after consumption., Even if it's not the most fascinating lesson, you may save yourself time on the homework or grief on the tests later.


Take exact notes on what the teacher is saying.
Use your favorite pen, or special paper to take notes- a little motivation can go a long way.
Think about how to structure your notes- you don't need to write it down sentence by sentence, but can organize your notes with bullet points, subheadings and even little drawings.This will help you understand the material and pass the time.

, The time will pass much faster when you are engaged in the material.


Ask about the assigned text and what you haven't understood. This will also give your teacher feedback, and will help them structure their classes differently in the future.Disagree with someone's point of view. In a respectful manner, argue your counter-point. Even if you lose the argument, you've sharpened your argumentative skills, paid attention, and passed class time.Offer to volunteer in group work or demonstrations- even if you are not perfect, your willingness to participate can boost your grade.Make eye contact with your teacher. Any teacher will respect you for trying your best and signalling them if you're lost.

Make sure you have all of your supplies.,
Bring decorative supplies.,
Come with things to pass out to your class.",How to Make Your Class Fun Without Getting in Trouble1," Class will be much more stressful if you don’t bring everything you’re supposed to. Make sure to bring your textbooks, pencils, homework, paper, and anything else you will need to be prepared. It’s easier to have fun in class when there is no unnecessary stress. Being prepared for class will also show your teacher your seriousness about the subject, which can improve relations, and in turn, make class more enjoyable for both parties.Bring a few extra pens and paper to lend out to other students who may have forgotten their supplies.;
, Personalizing your supplies and locker can make class more enjoyable. Cover your folders with stickers or drawings. Bring cute erasers for the tops of your pencils. Put pictures of your friends and family into binders. Add any decoration that you enjoy looking at, as long as it’s allowed in the classroom.You can also ask your teacher if it’s possible to help decorate the classroom for holidays like Halloween and Valentine’s Day.

, It’s not likely that this is something you can do regularly, but occasionally bringing things to pass out to class can liven the mood. First, ask the permission of your teacher. If it’s okay with them, you can bake cookies to pass out to your classmates, or bring another snack that can be enjoyed by everyone. Coordinate with your friends to take turns bringing treats to class.Ask your classmates if anyone has any food allergies before choosing a treat to bring.
Bring healthy snacks like banana bread and popcorn cups.

"
Politely decline.,
Use favorable items secretively and keep them out of sight.,
Wait to get out your item if everyone needs it immediately.,
Attempt to distract the person and/or get away.,
Be polite to anybody who asks.,
Pretend that you either don't have the item(s) or cannot distribute it for some reason.,
Tell them that you have only a small quantity left.,
Pretend to be sick if asked for items that you could contaminate.,
Tell others that you don't share items that could spread germs.,
Reserve items of lesser quality to lend out.",How to Get People to Stop Asking to Use Your Stuff in School," Just say ""No."" If the person asks why, you might say, ""It's not important—I just don't lend stuff out."" If that doesn't work, resort to other methods. If the person asking for a pen is your friend, smile and joke ""What do you guys think I am, some walking-talking drugstore?"". This is funny but the other people get the idea.;
, Try giving your friends things before class. Either bring enough for everybody or don't let everybody know about it. Naturally, if you have some sort of desirable item, everyone is going to want it. As soon as you pull out things like food, you will probably get requests, so eat snacks quickly and quietly.

, If the teacher tells everyone to get some paper, wait until the last possible moment to get yours. The moochers will borrow paper from other unsuspecting classmates and you will be free!

, If the item is not currently visible, there are many excuses that could enable you to get away from the person that is asking and avoid the situation altogether. Tell them someone else has the item. If they persist, pretend you have to go somewhere (i.e. your locker or home) to get the item. This is perfect if the teacher doesn't let you out of class. Most likely the person will forget.

, Do not be snappy and mean when people ask to borrow something. Act like you are genuinely sorry that you do not have/cannot let them borrow the item.

, If the person is asking, ""Do you have a dollar I can borrow?"", just say, ""No. I don't have any money."" Or even better, say ""I don't have a dollar you can borrow."" In most cases, the person will just find someone else to ask but if the person knows you have money, say, ""Oh, no, sorry. That's my lunch/friend's/gas money."" Pretending your parents don't let you lend money or other expensive things is also effective. Be creative!

, This works well with paper, pencil lead, tissues, gum, etc. Make sure that the item(s) are hidden away if you want to use this method.

, If people ask to have some of your lip gloss or balm, make-up, or drink, just say you are sick--like you have a cold sore or a cough. However, this will not stop some people. If so:

, For example, if you are in the bathroom, fixing your hair and somebody asks to use your hairbrush, you could potentially get head lice by sharing your brush. You might just have to say, ""Sorry. I don't share hairbrushes because I'm paranoid about lice."" In the case of lip balm or similar items the person might say they will wipe it off. A good reply would be, ""No. Please don't, okay? I'm really picky about letting people use my (item) because I get sick easily.""

, For example you probably have a bunch of low-quality wooden pencils lying around or just have an old pen. Keep a few in your pencil pouch and lend those out. This way you won't be sad if they are lost or broken!

Participate in class discussions.,
Make jokes when appropriate.,
Ask the teacher to do something special.,
Take notes in a creative way.,
Give yourself a reward.",How to Make Your Class Fun Without Getting in Trouble2," Class can seem much more boring if you are not paying attention and if you’re not an active participant. You may feel nervous about it at first, but try to participate in class discussions. You should also try to answer questions when the teachers ask them. Being engaged in your learning environment will make the time pass faster, the material more interesting, and it will benefit your education.Make notes about points you would like to make or questions you’d like to answer.
Ask for feedback about points you’ve made.

, A classroom doesn’t always have to be strictly serious. Depending on your teacher, make jokes about the course material during class discussions. During breaks, joke with your friends. Be sure that you aren’t making inappropriate jokes or disrupting the classroom environment.If you’re learning about physics, learn some physics jokes. For example: Q: What is the name of the first electricity device? A: Sherlock Ohms., Your teacher may say no, but it doesn’t hurt to ask your teacher to do something out of the ordinary occasionally. Ask to prepare a lesson that is more interactive than usual. You can also ask to have class outside on an especially beautiful day. Plan the activity according to the subject you’re learning.


For example, if you’re in an environmental science class, ask the teacher if it would be possible to go outside and learn about the environment firsthand.

, If taking notes seems boring, find a way to liven it up. Use colored or glittery pens. Find colored paper, or use paper that has a design in the corners. Bring multicolored highlights to highlight important parts of the lecture. You can also doodle in the corner of your paper if it helps you focus on what the teacher is saying.Work on some different, fun ways to organize the notes until you find a way that works for you.

, If you can’t manage to make class itself more exciting, create rewards for yourself for doing well in class. For example, get a candy bar to eat after class if you manage to sit through class without losing focus. Or, allow yourself to watch an extra hour of television that night if you take notes throughout the duration of the class."

Sit next to friends.,
Chat with friends during break.,
Talk to a new person.",How to Make Your Class Fun Without Getting in Trouble3," You may not be able to talk during class, but sitting next to people who you like can make the classroom more enjoyable. If this isn’t possible due to assigned seating, try to be friendly with the people that surround you. Liking the people you’re in class with makes the experience a lot easier.


If you’re having trouble starting a conversation, ask about last night’s homework. If you don’t want the subject to be about school, compliment them on their hair, outfit, or backpack.

, Avoid getting into trouble during class by saving your talking for the break. Even if it’s just a few minutes, use that time to talk with your friends. If you’re teacher isn’t busy during break, you can use that time to talk with them. It doesn’t hurt to get to know your teachers.


If you don’t have a break, chat with your friends a few minutes before or after class.

, You will be spending a lot of time with your classmates, so it is good to get to know as many of them as possible. Don’t be afraid to talk to a new person. They will already have things in common with you, like age and what you’re learning. It’s especially nice to talk to the students who are shy and don’t seem to have many friends.Ask the person about their interests and what they enjoy doing outside of class.

Change the way you chew.,
Do not chew very fruity or tasteful gum.,
Practice a few minutes a day at home talking with gum in your mouth.,
Think like the teacher.,
Chew the gum outside of the classroom during a passing period.,
Distract people away from your mouth.,
Stop chewing your gum when the teacher is nearby.,
Don't blow a bubble.,
Create a diversion.,
Discard the gum.,
Swallow the gum.,
Admit defeat.",How to Chew Gum in Class," Chew slowly and discreetly. Make sure your mouth is shut. Do not make unnecessary chewing noises. Practice chewing this way for edible food that you put in your mouth. It will help you chew more quietly during class.;
, There are many varieties of gums you can choose from.Certain chewing gums can leave a very powerful and strong scent behind, which your teacher can easily smell. Choose a non-colored gum; one that is preferably white or pink and looks similar to the features in your mouth.

, While speaking, maneuver the gum with your tongue to the top left or right of the upper corners of your mouth near your molars (the teeth closest to the back of your head). You can also hide the gum under your tongue or on the roof of your mouth. Eventually, you will become skilled at speaking with gum in your mouth.


If you lift up your upper lip to your nose you will see your gums. Hide your chewing gum there and suck back to flatten it. This can be painful if done for too long.

, Put yourself in his/her shoes. If you were the teacher and thought that a student might be chewing gum, you'd probably try several different tactics to find the culprit.


Avoid patterns of chewing gum in the same class. A teacher may begin to notice that you always chew gum in his/her class. Chew gum at different classes and times of day to create a habit of spontaneity.

, Try to do this before you get to class. If you have a fresh piece of gum, have a drink of cold water as it drains away the scent.


The longer you chew the same piece of gum, the harder it gets to chew. Note that this may lead to more noise when chewing.
Chewing can also help the scent of the gum to dissipate more quickly.

, Draw people away by using hand gestures and direct eye contact when speaking. Gum can leave a very powerful and strong scent.


When answering yes or no questions, feel free to nod instead of answering.

, Just let it sit in your mouth. Do not move the gum with your tongue because your throat will move as well.

, Your teachers and classmates will hear it pop. They may even be watching as you blow the bubble with your mouth.

, Ask to use the restroom to avoid being suspicious. Pretend to yawn during class, while cupping your hand over your mouth. Pretend to bite your nails. You may also act like you're getting something out of your teeth. Try a fake sneeze or cough to stay out of trouble.


If you have braces, and the teacher sees you move your mouth in a chewing motion you can always say that it was wax. If you think your teacher is suspicious of you having gum, ask to go to the bathroom to fix the wax/bracket/etc. It makes him or her think it was an orthodontic issue, not chewing gum!
If the teacher smells your gum and asks about it, hide the gum in your mouth or simply say you had some candy earlier. If they ask what candy, answer with something that smells like your gum.

, When you throw your gum away, hold your hand up to your face like you are scratching your nose and with your tongue move the gum into the palm of your hand. Always make sure you have a tissue, old wrapper, or piece of paper in your pocket to put the discarded gum into. Remember, some teachers know this trick, they were at school once too!


You can also pretend to blow your nose while discarding the gum.

, The popular misconception that it will take 7 years to pass through the digestive system is not true. The gum will pass through quite harmlessly without sticking to anything that it should not. However, there's no point in doing so if the teacher has already seen it.

, If your teacher has caught you, own up to your gum chewing. Let them know you'll never do it in their class again. There's no point in enraging them any further by swallowing it or lying about it (which may get you into even worse trouble). Admit defeat, practice, and try again in another class.


When asked if you are chewing gum, reply no and state that you were chewing on your tongue. If they don't believe you, open your mouth while hiding the gum and stick out your tongue. Keep in mind that your gum may fall out, or fall down your throat while doing this. Do only if you are absolutely sure that the teacher is not certain you're breaking the rules.
If you get caught, bite a little bit off and spit some of your gum in the bin. When walking back to your seat, you'll still have a bit of the gum. Start chewing discreetly when your teacher's back is turned.

Wait until class has started.,
Take off facial accessories.,
Find a comfortable position.,
Use a makeshift pillow.,
Bring your feet off the ground.,
Adjust to the noise level.,
Do silent breath work.,
Listen to soothing music.",How to Fall Asleep in Class1," If the bell hasn’t rung and you are already dozing off, you’re more likely to draw attention to yourself. Hold off until roll call is finished and a few minutes of discussion has passed. This tactic allows the teacher to feel confident that their students are paying attention. Once the first few minutes of class have passed, you’ll have a better chance at sleeping undetected.;
, This step depends on your sleeping posture. If you intend on putting your face or head down on the desk, this is a must. Whether you wear eyeglasses, prescription sunglasses, or have facial piercings, you’ll most likely want to remove them. Otherwise you risk breaking them and/or causing harm to your face while sleeping.


Keep your glasses nearby in case you are called on and need to read.
Facial piercings are harder to remove; consider taking them out before class so it is done safely.
If you don’t want to remove any piercings, choose a position that doesn’t put pressure on them. This will prevent any cuts or bruising to the face.

, The two things to consider here are your comfort, and how much you want to risk being obviously asleep. Consider your relationship with the teacher, the likelihood of punishment if caught, and whether you can handle those consequences.


Put one elbow with your arm standing up on the desktop. Put the side of your head in your hand like Rodin’s ‘’The Thinker’’ statue. This position is good if you need to be ready to snap quickly back to focus.
Cross your arms on the desktop and lean forward, burying your head in your arms. If your neck gets tired, switch it from side to side. Be aware that the teacher is more likely to notice you in positions like this.
Put both elbows on the table with your arms lifted straight up and clasp your hands together like someone praying. Lean your head forward onto your hands and sleep. This position makes it harder to achieve a deep sleep; however, the added benefit is you appear to be deep in thought, potentially about the class.
Fold your arms across your chest and lean back in the desk seat. This position’s benefit is that is takes pressure off your lower back. Consider bringing a small support to maintain the curve of your spine, an important part of good sleeping posture., Desktops are often hard and uncomfortable; sleeping on your arms can be painful and cause them to go numb over time. Another option is to use a pillow. However you’re better off not bringing and using an actual pillow as this could draw unwanted attention, and disrespect the teacher.


Use your backpack as a sturdy head support. If it is uncomfortable, rearrange the objects inside to make a better pillow. Removing items with awkward or overlarge shapes (like a basketball) may be necessary.
Use your jacket or sweater for a softer pillow. Rolling clothes into a ball shape can take a flat, soft fabric, and turn it into a more robust head support.

, Elevating the legs, whether you’re sitting or lying, reduces pressure on the veins, relaxing them and encouraging blood flow.This will help your body relax and lead you off to sleep.


Consider stacking your textbooks for the day beneath your desk as a repurposed footstool.

, While some are quiet and focused, many classrooms are often full of conversation and don’t provide the ideal environment for falling asleep. You can adapt to this by trying to sleep in noisy places where you don’t have to worry about the teacher.


Go to the movies, ride city public transportation, go to a talkative café. Try falling asleep in active places and learn to let go of the worry that comes from hearing many noises.
Wear earplugs. If you can’t fall asleep at all, consider getting a traditional sleep aid.Keep in mind this is a big risk because you can no longer hear the teacher.

, Breath through the nose, into the belly, to a count of four. Hold it for seven seconds. Exhale very slowly through the mouth for eight seconds. The ""4-7-8"" breathing technique is based on Ayurvedic practices from India and different doctors claim that it can help relax and lead anyone into sleep.Monitor your breathing so that it is not too loud. Ideally, this is a silent technique for relaxing and helping yourself fall asleep in otherwise disturbing environments.

, Put in a set of earplugs and play music that is relaxing to you. For instance, instrumental tracks of falling rain, crashing waves, and forest animals are often used for this purpose. Slower songs between 60 and 80BPM (beats per minute) are generally more likely to induce sleep.One downside to this tactic is you won’t be able to hear the teacher if they call on you. Consider only wearing one ear bud.
Native American flute music, binaural beats, and meditative chanting are more examples of music used to induce sleep.

Make eye contact with your teacher.,
Pick a seat out of the teacher’s eyesight.,
Wear a nasal strip.,
Stay half-focused.,
Pretend you’re reading.,
Wear a hooded sweater.,
Wear a pair of false eyeglasses.,
Wear dark sunglasses.,
Enlist a friend to help you.,
Talk to your teacher.",How to Fall Asleep in Class2," Listen attentively to your teacher at the beginning of class. This might give them the impression you’re focused. The goal here is to subtly encourage them to feel like they don’t need to worry about you or pay attention to what you’re doing.


Know that many teachers – especially those more experienced – won’t be so easily fooled.
Consider staying awake for a longer amount of time and offering to answer a few questions. Some teachers will feel satisfied with your participation and focus on other students from that point on.

, You can do this in two ways: pick a seat with someone larger sitting in front of you, or strategically observe the angle of sight from the teacher to your seat.


Find a classmate whose body would normally block you from the teacher’s sight even if you were sitting up straight. This way it will be less noticeable that you’re sleeping.
Sit in different desks and look at the teacher’s desk. Are you in their direct line of sight or their peripheral vision? Are there a number of angles that other students are blocking? You want a seat that is not easy to see.

, This is especially important if you snore. In order to stay covert you need to eliminate any noise coming from your desk; getting caught snoring could lead to an embarrassing situation. Choose a brand with clear or transparent material so that it is not obvious to your teacher.


Nasal strips are a small piece of self-adhesive tape that pull the nostrils apart, keep the nasal passage clear, and prevent snoring.Nasal dilators are also available should the strips not work for you., Don’t allow yourself to fully relax and go into deep sleep. Depending on how comfortable you are disrespecting the teacher, or potentially being embarrassed and/or punished, you need to keep half an ear open. This way you’ll be more prepared to jump to focus if the teachers calls on you.


Pay attention to how deep you are resting. If you start to forget the room you’re in, pull your awareness back and sit up for a brief moment.
If you are in serious need of sleep but have to be prepared to engage in class, change your position every 5 minutes to prevent falling asleep completely.

, Some postures – like the thinking and praying positions – will work better with a prop. Keep a textbook or notebook visibly in your lap to give the impression that even if you’re not looking forward, you’re focused on the studies at hand.


Make sure to use the textbook or notebook for the right class. When students study for different classes it annoys some teachers (i.e. having your chemistry book out in English).
The book should be placed so that your gaze appears to be directed at the book. For example, don’t have your book on the right leg while you are nodding off and looking to the left.

, This limits the amount of your face that is visible to anyone in the room. You’ll be able to hide the fact you’re sleeping more easily if your features are withdrawn into your clothes.


Some teachers do not allow students to wear hoodies, or hats in class.

, Different toy companies produce glasses with open, focused eyes printed on the lenses. These are a tad gimmicky, but if you’re farther away from the teacher, they may give them impression that you’re looking forward while behind the lenses your eye are closed.


Novelty toy stores, costume shops, and many online vendors sell the glasses.
Look at all your options and choose the glasses whose painted eyes most closely resemble your own.

, There are some medical conditions that necessitate wearing sunglasses all during the day to prevent overexposure to light. Without a Doctor’s note, some teachers may refuse letting you wear sunglasses in class. Nevertheless, if you are willing to try this method, you could pass unnoticed. If that’s the case, your eyes will be entirely hidden and you can sleep assuming you sit up and aren’t called on during class.


Reasons many people give for wearing sunglasses indoors center around light sensitivity and discomfort in bright light, know as photophobia. These include acute iritis, corneal abrasions, glaucoma, and meningitis.Although adults and children alike create fake Doctor’s notes, this is not advised.Don’t risk the trouble it could cause you.

, It is hard to know what the teacher is doing while you’re asleep. Ask a close friend to sit next to you or behind you so they can easily pinch you or get your attention. This will decrease the likelihood the teacher catches you.


If the teacher is walking near you, have the friend nudge you.
If the teacher has called on you, have your friend pinch you to communicate it’s more serious.

, Sometimes the best option is not to try and hide your fatigue, but instead approach your teacher directly. Explain to your teacher why you are tired and ask if you can please rest. If there is a legitimate reason you have to sleep, they may be understanding and allow it; or ask you to go sleep in the nurse’s office so as not to disturb class.


Some possible reasons may be, “I’ve had a really rough day and I need to put my head down for a minute to recover,” or ““my parents were yelling at me all night and I really need to rest for a few minutes. I apologize in advance if I fall asleep for a few minutes.”
When approaching your teachers openly like this, it’s also best to have a plan for catching up on whatever you miss while sleeping. You can set your smart phone to record lecture in class or organize with a friend to read their notes. Share this plan with your teacher.

Inform your friends.,
Ask your friends to stop talking to you.,
Move your seat.,
Start an open journal.,
Practice tolerance in class.,
Silence your phone.",How to Be Quiet During Class1," When you have decided to change the way you behave in class, it is an important first step to inform your friends. If you explain your reasons for wanting to make this big change, your friends will support you. In addition, this will give them a heads up that you’ll be acting differently towards them, and that way they won’t be offended., If your friends keep talking you and you feel forced to respond, explain that you do not want to get in trouble anymore for talking during class. Make it clear that your studies are important to you, and that you would be happy to talk later., If somebody continually disrespects your request, change seats. If you have assigned seating, ask your teacher after class if you can move desks. Tell your teacher that you are becoming distracted in your current spot., If things you would like to say to your friends keep coming up during class, consider writing them down! It can be a fun idea to start an “open journal” with a few of your friends. An open journal is a journal that a few people share and pass between them. This can be a lot of fun, and it also helps you to communicate without breaking the rules in class., If you talk a lot because you are angry or upset with others, learn to control how you respond. The next time somebody says something rude, simply stay quiet and nod toward the teacher to indicate that you are trying to pay attention. Raise your hand and speak to the teacher if the other person does not stop. If the situation is delicate and you would prefer not to make a scene, speak to your teacher after class instead.

, Another aspect of being quiet in class involves turning off or silencing your cell phone. Remember to do this before class begins. Notifications and other audio sounds coming from your cell phone can be a huge distraction to your teacher, classmates, and even yourself. Furthermore, putting your phone away and refraining from texting, games, or social media during class is another way to be ""quiet"" and pay closer attention to what you're learning."
"
Figure out which class(es) you find most boring.,
Find a school notebook that is fairly empty.,
Appear organized and ready to learn.,
Participate at first.,
Sit far away from the troublemakers or class clowns.,
Doodle things you like, for example, your favourite cartoon character, Videogame character, etc.",How to Doodle During Class," You can even doodle during the entire school day if you're lucky.;
, A few class notes from previous classes in the front works best. It makes it more believable that you weren't doodling.

, Don't overdo this if you usually space out or are the ""average"" student, it'll make your teacher suspicious. When you arrive at your desk (preferably one near the back of the classroom), open your notebook to a clean page and have your pencil/pen in hand as if you are ready to take notes.

, Answer a few questions or add on to the lecture the teacher's giving. Appear attentive for the first five minutes, then take your pencil and move slowly towards the clean page. Doodle, but don't overdo it. Every few minutes or however often you would like look up and nod as though you are understanding the lesson or let your eyes widen as though you were realizing that ""that is how it worked"". Then look down, pretend you are taking detailed notes, and continue.

, The teacher is usually more focused on keeping an eye on them, and you do NOT want him/her to watch you so closely. You may want to get them to do something during class (if they don't already do things like throwing pencils at each other) and wait. The teacher will notice and maybe move the kids, but you'll be safe as you are far away from the direction of the teacher's attentive eyes. Experiment a bit. Try sitting close to your friends and doodle during class or sitting next to a complete stranger and doodle.

, This may seem sad but it's actually quite fun if you're young at heart.

Make a commitment.,
Avoid eating in class.,
Set small goals.,
Use a reward system.,
Pay attention to the behavior of others.,
Let loose during breaks.",How to Be Quiet During Class2," Every morning before you go to school, remind yourself not to talk or make noise in class. Just say it aloud before you get out of bed, or while in the bathroom. By reaffirming your dedication every day, you will be solidifying it in your mind., Another way that you can exercise discipline and increase your ability to be quiet is to avoid eating during class. Eating during class involves the rustling of packages, sounds of chewing, and a general distraction for yourself and those around you. Instead, try to eat a balanced breakfast and to snack between classes only., It may be too big of stretch to simply switch to not making noise in any of your classes. Instead, start with smaller goals and work your way up. For example, if you tend to be very chatty in a particular class, work to stay quiet in just that one class. After a few days, maybe you can add 1-2 more classes to your “quiet list.” Keep moving in this direction until you can maintain this behavior throughout the day., You may consider implementing a reward system for yourself. Tell yourself you will only watch your favorite show or play your favorite game if you manage to go a specific length of time without talking or making noise out of turn. This is a great practice for developing a sense of self-discipline and pride in your work., Your entire life will be full of all kinds of different situations. In some of them, you will be free to talk and make noise as you please; in most, you will not. It is important to know what behavior is appropriate in which situation, as well as how to control your behavior. Take a look at the students who are talking and acting up in class. Chances are, they aren’t portraying a very positive image. Look instead for positive role models, and model your behavior after them.

, Of course, nobody wants to be quiet all the time. It wouldn’t be healthy to do so! Instead, get all your talking out during the appropriate times, such as lunch, passing periods, or other break times. Use these moments to blow off steam, so that when class begins again you can focus."
"
Come to class prepared.,
Pay attention in class.,
Take notes in class.,
Participate in class.,
Find a way to engage with the material.",How to Be Quiet During Class3," You are going to have a much easier time refraining from making noise in class if you are paying attention, and if you understand what you are learning. One way to help ensure this is to come to class fully prepared. This means doing any assigned reading or other homework, bringing the proper books or other materials, and just making sure that you understand the unit you are covering. If you are not sure about what you’re learning, take some time to speak to your teacher and get caught up.Part of being prepared also means arriving on time.
Get to class a few minutes early, so that you can get out any books, notebooks, or other materials, and avoid rummaging through your bag during class. (This is another way to stay quiet.)

, If you talk because you are bored, you are missing out on your education. Even a slow lecture can be filled with interesting information. By keeping your mind on the class, you’’ll be reducing the temptation to talk just to pass the time., One tactic to help you stay engaged during class is to take notes. Write down what your teacher says in a way that will make sense to you later. Also, write down any questions you may have. Even doodling on a piece of scrap paper will occupy you enough to help keep you from talking or making noise, while still leaving you with enough focus to understand the teacher.

, Aside from just listening to what your teacher says, you can stay engaged and prevent yourself from making too much noise by actually participating in class. Whenever you think of a question or comment, raise your hand and state it. In addition to preventing you from talking, this is sure to improve your grade., Any class is going to be more interesting to you if you can find a way to engage with the material and apply it to your life. If you can stay engaged and interested, you are far less likely to talk or make noise during class. Maybe you can use some of the algebra you’ve been learning to calculate how much gas money you’ll need for an upcoming road trip; perhaps you can use some of the communication theories you’ve learned in sociology to help some friends solve an argument; or maybe a book you are reading in English class can be an analogy for your life. Even if it feels like a stretch, search for some way to make the material you are learning more personal."

Ask questions that dig deeper into the subject.,
Improve your vocabulary.,
Bring up a current event that relates to the class.,
Try to learn independently.,
Use body language that shows you’re listening.",How to Make the Teacher Think You Are Smart1," Ask questions in class that show the teacher that you’re paying attention. If you’re confused about something, ask for some clarification.Try to avoid asking questions just for the sake of it, but do your best to have a genuine interest in learning more. When you do your assigned reading or other homework the night before, consider writing down a couple good questions to ask the next day.
For example, if that day’s class is about the Boston Tea Party, ask something like, “Why did the Sons of Liberty dress up like Mohawk warriors when they destroyed the tea?”;
, Learning and using new words is an easy way to make a teacher think you’re smart. A word of the day calendar or app is a great way to learn new words. Try entering a new word into a search engine to find examples of how to use it properly in a sentence.Most dictionary apps, like Dictionary.com's app, have word of the day options. Consider games such as the 7 Little Words app to have fun while building your vocabulary.You don’t need to use big words unnecessarily, but using a new word in a way that clearly makes your point is a sure way to impress teachers. For example, maybe you've seen the words symbolic, defiance, and harbinger on your word of the day app. You could say in class, ""The Boston Tea Party was a symbolic act of defiance that proved to be a harbinger of the American Revolution.""

, Show the teacher that you care about what’s going on in the world and that you think about what you’re learning outside of class. Pay attention to what’s going on in the news and think of ways that story might apply to what you’re learning in school.For example, in your class on the Boston Tea Party, you might bring up a news story you saw about taxation. You might raise your hand and talk about how taxes were involved in that historical event and continue to be an important political topic.

, Do your best to go above and beyond and learn material on your own. If you know you'll be learning about the FOIL method in math class next week, teach yourself about it prior to class. That way, when the teacher asks if anyone knows what FOIL stands for, you'll raise your hand and say, ""It's how you multiply two binomials: First, Outer, Inner, Last!""

, Remember, you don’t have to speak to show that you’re participating in class. Don’t slouch in your chair, nap during class, or text and play on your phone. Instead, make eye contact, take notes, and nod your head when the teacher makes a point."

Put effort into doing your written homework.,
Do the assigned reading.,
Study a little every day.,
Talk to your teacher outside of class.",How to Make the Teacher Think You Are Smart2," Take a little time to proofread your work. Make sure your assignment is completed according to the teacher’s instructions. Try to write neatly so your teacher can understand your essay or math problems.If your work is neat and organized, your teacher will know you’re smart enough to care about great presentation and effort.

, In addition to completing your written homework neatly, avoid skipping out on your reading homework. Simply doing the reading is the easiest way to impress your teachers. It’ll show them that you’re actually interested in being prepared to learn in class., At some point after school, take some time to review your notes from class that day. Studying a bit every day will help you connect one day’s lesson with another. Your teacher will think you’re smart for making connections between class sessions and for having great time management skills.


In addition, come test time, your brain will thank you if you study a little every day instead of cramming at the last minute!

, If you have time, try to stick around after class to talk to the teacher more about what you've been studying. If they have office hours, pay them a visit to discuss anything from the material in class to current events.If you need a little extra help with something, ask your teacher to clarify a lesson or for some tutoring outside of class.

Be on time and avoid being absent.,
Work well with other students.,
Try not to be a know it all.,
Thank your teacher.",How to Make the Teacher Think You Are Smart3," Do your best to show up for school or class early. While everyone gets sick sometimes and needs to stay home, try to miss as little school as possible.Getting to class before other students will also help your teacher notice you more.

, Do your best to get along with your classmates. If someone is having trouble understanding something, raise your hand and try to explain the material in a way that might help the other student. When you’re assigned group projects, avoid slacking off and leaving most of the work to other students.You teacher will think you’re really smart if you show them that you want others to learn, too.

, Do your best to be genuine about wanting to learn instead of wanting to simply appear to be smart. Try to be more concerned with actually learning about a class session's topic than with just showing off how smart you are. Be sincere, positive, and enthusiastic instead of trying to suck up or be a know it all.Try not to raise your hand and rephrase what the teacher just said or bring up an unrelated subject just because you know a lot about it. For example, if your teacher mentions that the Boston Tea Party happened in 1773 and you know an unrelated event that also happened that year, it's probably not helpful to raise your hand and tell the class about the other event just to sound smart.
Be sure to remember who the teacher is, and avoid acting like a know it all by giving the teacher constant corrections.

, If you show a little appreciation, your teacher will not only like you but know that you care about the value of education. Again, try not to be a suck up or insincere. Think of ways that you’ve learned from your teacher, and try to be brief but specific.


For example, you might say, “It was really cool to learn about the Boston Tea Party, and I wanted to thank you for teaching us about it. I used to think it was literally a tea party! Now I understand that it was an important symbolic protest and involved so many complicated factors.”

Deliver the Card on Teacher's Day!",How to Make a Card for Teacher's Day2," During regular school hours, everybody is busy. Hence, it is a good idea to plan ahead of time, if you want to design a photo card for your teacher. Time goes fast, and things can take longer than expected, so be generous when you budget your time.


Depending on whether you want to use a photo printing service,or whether you need to ask people for photos, start at least two weeks in advance.
Compare prices of photo printing services- often you can get good deals if you look around carefully.
Look at photo cards online and compare designs- this will make picking one easier for you later.

, Most people have phone cameras or small digital cameras and take a lot of pictures. Still finding the right ones can be a bit tricky.


Look for pictures showing you and your teacher, for example on a field trip, or a school festivity.
Check the school website for pictures of you and your teacher.
Ask other teachers, your friends and parents if you have trouble finding photos.

, Even if you end up having a lot of different pictures from different occasions, you have to check them for quality.


Check whether you and your teacher are clearly visible and the photo is not blurry.
Compare the formats of the digital files and see if they are supported by your program. Print the pictures out- sometimes you cannot tell on a computer screen how they come out printed.

, Now that you have come up with a selection of high-quality pictures, you need to decide which ones should actually go into the card's design.


Use pictures with as many smiles possible-memories of happy times will put your teacher in a good mood and make them smile!
Decide on a number of pictures- too few can make the card look empty, too many will look crowded.
Put the printed pictures together for a hand-made collage- this will help you visualize the final product.

, This can take a bit of time and effort. Remember though to have fun with it and use the creative potential these programs harbor.


Use a photo software for your collage, such as Photoshop, Picasaor iPhoto for example. These are the most common ones, but there are plenty of others, so look around!
Consider using an online photo service. Common photo printing services include Snapfish or Shutterflyfor example. The downside is that they are not free and it takes time until the printed cards arrive.

, There are pros and cons to using templates- if you are not very experienced, or running out of time, a template is a good solution.


Both photo software and photo printing services often have pretty templates that will frame your pictures nicely.

, Now that you have discarded the bad quality ones, and picked the pictures you like best, it's time to move towards the final product- re-arranging the pictures.


Play around with the different features the software or photo service has.
Put a picture of your teacher in the center. The card is for them after all!

Make sure the picture shows your teacher in their best angle.


Save your card- you might need to print it again later.

, This is a quick step, but needs to be prepared properly.


Ensure that your printer has enough ink cartridges (if you are using an ink printer) or that the toner is full (if you are printing with a laser printer).
Use photo paper to print the card. This will make the pictures come out beautifully.
Print different sizes of your card to see which looks the best.

, Depending on the size and material you've printed, it can take a little longer. While you wait you can prepare the next steps.

Be creative in your text- try out writing a short poem,, or a list of good adjectives spelling out their first and last name.

, This is a simple step, but pay attention to detail!


Print out the card several times, in case you fold the wrong way or misspell something.
Use a ruler when folding, to be exact- teachers love neatness!
Choose the card that looks the best. This is obviously in the eye of the beholder, but pay attention to the overall design. Which card is the most clean looking, and accurate?

, This is the heart of the card- you message should support the pictures, and make your teacher smile.


Write a draft first- you don't want to have to cross out words in the card for your teacher!
Reference the event(s) shown on the picture when you write the card- this will make your card one-of-a-kind!

, A good delivery rounds off the entire card making operation.


Give the card to your teacher either before or after class (after is usually better).
Put on a smile and give your teacher the card. This will tell them that something good is coming and put them at ease.
Consider asking the school administrative assistant/secretary to put the card in your teacher's mailbox. After a long day, this will make them smile!

Look online,in books,and magazines.Ask friends if they have instructions for designs.

Make sure your friends are at roughly the same skill level as you are.


Double-check on whether your friends are using their design- you don't want to look like a copy cat.
Make a shortlist of about five different designs that you like.

, When picking the card that you'd like to make for your teacher, think about different aspects, not just the final product:


Think about what your card should express: does the design capture it? Do you want a funny, a sentimental or a happy card?
Look at the difficulty level- is it something you can do by yourself?
Be honest with yourself and ask for help if it looks too hard.

, After you've picked your card, it's time to get to the next step in the planning phase.


Read the instructions carefully, and if possible, compare with pictures or videos. See if there are tips and helpful hints in the instructions that you can use.
Write the list noting how much of what material you need.

, Once you have a list together, assemble your materials- see what you have and get the materials you still need.


Take stock of what you already have- sometimes you can use old items you don't need anymore. For example, you could use old crayola stumps to form your teacher's initials on the card.Go to an arts and crafts store to buy what you need - often the sales people have great ideas and can help, too!

, This can be a bit of a tedious step, but in order to get the design and the card right, be extra diligent when it comes to following the instructions.


Read every step carefully to make sure you know what to do.
Take notes after you've completed your step- this can help you in the future.
Ask someone for help if you are unsure of how you should do something.

, This is one of the most important parts of the card- it verbalizes your appreciation, and underlines the visual message of the card.


Write from the heart and be specific: What makes your teacher so special?
Think about different ways of expressing your gratitude- a haiku for example, or if it's for your French teacher, try it en français!

, This is the last step, so make sure your delivery is perfect!

, Now that you've decided on what you'd like to do, think of what you have and what you need and write it down.


Look around the house and see what you already have- old paper scraps could be re-purposed for shapes you want to glue to your card, for example.
Ask friends and family for old materials they might discard otherwise, such as textile cloths or old crayons.
Consider using different materials to layer the card, for example: markers, crayons, glitter, glue, stickers, pens, and paint.

Consider making a second card, to have a backup.

, This is often perceived as the hardest part, as you don't want to be clichéd or trite in your words.


Be honest and creative: tell them why they are great, but tell them in your own special way: For example, write your message in a secret code and leave them a clue. Be personal: If there is a special instance when they helped you or were nice mention that. The fact that you remember shows that you pay attention and your teacher will love it.

, On to the home stretch! A beautifully delivered card underlines the content and makes your teacher happy.


Hand deliver the card.
Deliver the card when your teacher has a free moment and time to appreciate the card- that's after school most of the time.

Identify distractions.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Choose your seat wisely.,
Pay attention to your teacher.",How to Be Interested in a Boring School Lesson1," Listening will help you stay awake; however, many students become easily distracted, which results in not listening well. In order to combat distractions, you must identify internal or external “triggers.” Internal distractions are mental or emotional. Examples include thinking about a disagreement that you had with someone, the errands that you need to complete, or even what homework will be assigned.
External distractions are harder to control since they come from other people and your surroundings. Someone might be tapping a pencil, there could be construction going on outside or in the building, or the speaker’s style might be annoying.;
, Now that you've learned to identify distractions, you can avoid them. Some types of distractions are harder to avoid, such as having migraines or caretaking for a sick parent. However, when you notice that you are distracted, bring yourself back into the moment. , Avoid sitting by the door, especially if it is open and you can hear hall noise. Sit in the middle of the room toward the front. Make sure there isn't anything obstructing your view. Above all else, don't sit in the back! Teachers do not remember students who do that, which is not to your benefit. , Teachers will do certain things to emphasize key points. They will use signal phrases like, ""You need to know this....,"" ""Nurses should understand,"" or the more blunt, ""Write this down if you want to pass the test."" They might use their voice or use body language to make ideas stand out. Often, they'll repeat what you need to know. Additionally, they will write down crucial information on the board or display it on an overhead.

Find a note-taking strategy that works for you.,
Handwrite your notes.,
Move your hand constantly.",How to Be Interested in a Boring School Lesson2," There is no one way to take notes, but there are some best practices that you can follow. It is useful to identify which strategy or combination of strategies produces the best results. Translating the instructor's lecture into your own words keeps your brain awake. The positive effect is that you will likely stay awake.
Carefully choose information from PowerPoints or lectures. If you write down every detail, you won’t get the big picture. Plus, you can probably access the PowerPoint again if you ask the instructor. Use the margins of the textbook, your notebook, or post-it notes to list unfamiliar references or vocabulary words.
Use neon-colored pens and highlighters to mark the most important information. Those bright colors might stop you from snoozing, too!

, This information may sound surprising, but it’s true! Handwritten notes are superior to notes taken on a laptop. Those who write by hand are better equipped to understand and use the content than those who use computers. What a great reason to keep hand-writing those notes! , Even if you’ve gotten enough sleep, staying awake for an entire class can be challenging since many classrooms are uncomfortable and lack visual stimulation. They might be too hot or too cold, have dull wall colors, and/or lack art on the walls. However, taking notes can help you fight that sleepy feeling. The physical motion of taking notes keeps the blood circulating, which helps your brain stay on task.
If the teacher pauses or fusses with the overhead projector for long periods, keep that hand moving by creating a to-do list.
Feel free to doodle (draw animals, shapes, logos, etc). Doodling isn't distracting; in fact, it usually aids brain processes and helps students become interested in the course content. "

Many students dislike speaking in front of their classmates. It is understandable to feel uncomfortable or awkward, but at least give this strategy a shot. You might alleviate that boredom. During lecture, if the instructor speaks too quietly or too quickly, ask him or her to repeat the information.
If the instructor leaves something out or is unclear when giving directions, ask for clarity. For example, if he uses a word you don’t know, ask what it means. If she does not mention a due date, ask her when the assignment is due.

, If you have some knowledge or a personal experience that is relevant to the content, don’t withhold it! You are more likely to make friends if you speak up during group activities and get to know people. Someone that you thought was weird or dorky might become a confidante by the end of the course! , Instructors sometimes feel unappreciated. Even the grouchiest teacher might perk up, though, if you show some interest in him or her. Acknowledge an especially useful lesson, chat the instructor up about an interesting concept after class, ask for career advice, or take interest in his or her family life (ask how a child or even the dog is doing). If you get to know the instructor, you might be less irritated during class. "

Recognize negative thinking.,
Reverse your attitude.,
Reap the benefits.",How to Be Interested in a Boring School Lesson4," If you continuously attend boring classes with a negative mindset, you waste energy, you probably won’t make friends, and you won’t learn much, so it’s important to recognize unrewarding thoughts and to avoid them. Thinking about how much you hate the class is unproductive. It will just put you in a bad mood, which might last the rest of the day.
If you emit a crabby aura, other students probably won’t want to work with you on group projects. One of the greatest benefits of attending any class is meeting new people, so don’t lose out on that!
You will not absorb the information. If you choose not to read or do other assignments and/or text during lessons instead of listening, taking notes, and participating, you won’t retain the course content.

, Gather up your strength and turn those negative thoughts into positive ones! It will be harder to counter negative thinking on some days, but just try so that the humdrum class will become more tolerable. Remind yourself that the class only meets a few hours per week.
Remember that not everyone in this world has the opportunity to learn. Obtaining an education is a privilege. Realize that gaining knowledge is a good use of time.

, There are so many reasons to be a positive thinker. Being more upbeat will make class better and it will improve your life in general. When you limit pessimistic thinking, you will feel better mentally and emotionally.
Your grade in the class or at least the understanding of the content will improve.
Your stress level will lessen.
Overall, you will probably become a more likeable person, in or out of class.

Evaluate your actions.,
Ask your teacher why they seem to dislike you.,
Apologize for your wrongdoings.,
Talk to your parents or to the principal.",How to Make a Teacher Stop Hating You1," Do you talk back to your teacher? Do you distract your other classmates? Are you constantly talking during class or interrupting other students? You should evaluate your own behavior to figure out why your teacher seems to dislike you. If you realize that your actions are making your teacher dislike you, then it's time to make some changes in your behavior., If you are unsure why your teacher doesn't like you, ask them to have a private conversation with you. Don't actually ask ""Why do you hate me?"" Instead, you should express to your teacher that you'd like to do well in their class, and ask them what you can do to improve as a student. Prove to your teacher that you're a serious student and that you respect them. This may lead to your teacher respecting you back.


A few phrases you can say are:

""Passing this class is important to me, and I'd like to know what changes I need to make in order to make that happen.""
""I'd really like to improve my relationship to you, because I feel like I can learn a lot from you and this class. Please let me know what I can do to make that happen."", A genuine apology will go a long way with your teacher. When you apologize, you need to do two things. First of all, you need to acknowledge your wrongdoings and the negative impact that your actions have caused. Secondly, you need to show remorse for your actions. You must be genuine with your apology, and make a conscious effort to not make the same mistakes going forward., If you're feeling bullied, scared, or hurt by your teacher, it is important that you talk to the principal or to your parents. It is never okay for a teacher to bully a student, so you should seek help if you can't fix your relationship with your teacher on your own. If you believe your teacher is being inappropriate, talk to someone about it immediately.

Don't cause disruptions during class.,
Put effort into your schoolwork.,
Go above and beyond to participate in class.",How to Make a Teacher Stop Hating You2," Good students never cause disruptions or distractions during class, so be aware of your behavior. Don't talk to other students while class is in session, don't interrupt your fellow students or your teacher while they are talking, don't use your cellphone in class, don't curse or talk back to your teacher, and don't speak without raising your hand.

, If your teacher can tell that you are not putting any effort into your homework or class assignments, they won't be very impressed with you. Teachers like students who study for tests, turn in their homework assignments, and participate in group projects. If you're having trouble with your schoolwork, approach your teacher and ask them for help. If your teacher sees that you're trying, they'll usually appreciate your effort., Teachers appreciate students who genuinely enjoy learning and helping in the classroom. Always volunteer during class, offer to arrive early or stay late to help prepare a lesson or clean up the classroom, and ask your teacher if there are any extracurricular activities for you to get involved in. If you improve as a student, your relationship with your teacher should improve as well."
"
Get to know your teacher.,
Don't give your teacher a reason not to like you.,
Speak to your teacher respectfully.",How to Make a Teacher Stop Hating You3," You might see your teacher as only being a teacher, but keep in mind that they have a life of their own. Your teacher may be going through problems in their personal life, be stressed out from bad students, or be tired from working so much. Don't be too hard on your teacher and remember that they are a person too. Ask your teacher about their weekend, or what their favorite movies are. They'll appreciate you making an effort to learn more about them., You and your teacher don't have to be best friends, but you should be able to work together in a stress-free environment. Don't be a nuisance or give your teacher a hard time, and they'll most likely stop giving you a hard time. If you focus on your schoolwork and treat your teacher with respect, they should have no reason to dislike you., If your teacher seems to dislike you, it may be difficult for you to treat them with respect. However, if you're able to be respectful with your teacher while discussing schoolwork or personal issues, they may start to develop a mutual respect for you. When issues arise in the future, talk to your teacher respectfully, and in private, to hopefully resolve the issue.

Avoid yelling.,
Speak slowly.,
Use your natural voice.,
Do not worry about being wrong.,
Start small.,
Practice social behaviors.,
Join an extracurricular activity.,
Accept you'll sometimes feel awkward.,
Take your turn.,
Talk only when appropriate.,
Pay attention to social cues.,
Listen as much as you talk.",How to Be a Loud Student in Class," When speaking in class, it can help to have an idea of what to say going into a discussion. You may feel less nervous participating in a discussion if you have a thorough knowledge of your subject matter.Do your homework. If you know there's a debate or discussion coming up in class, preparing ahead of time can help. You'll be more at ease participating in class if you know what you're talking about, so do the reading and homework before coming to class.
Plan what to say before raising your hand. Think of a short sentence, or at least a couple of key points, before you volunteer to speak. It may help to jot down some of your ideas on a piece of paper before raising your hand to give an answer.;
, It can help to relax before speaking. This can make you feel more at ease, allowing yourself to speak with more confidence. Relaxing can also loosen your vocal cords, allowing you to talk in a loud, cohesive manner.Take a few deep breaths before speaking. Try to breathe in a way that draws breath down into your stomach. Inhale and exhale deeply before raising your hand, as this will allow you to speak louder.
Make an effort to relax your body before speaking. Relax your shoulders and neck, as tense muscles in these places will make it difficult to project your voice.

, Stand up with a straight back. Hold your head so your ears are in line with your shoulders. Keep your chin relaxed and avoid the temptation to jut it forward when you speak. Much like relaxing your body, maintaining proper posture boosts confidence. It also promotes air flow, allowing you to speak clearly., If you're not used to being vocal in class, you may be tempted to yell to make sure you are heard. Yelling strains the voice and makes you sound aggressive. It can cause tension in your neck and throat. Do not yell out the answer. Speak loudly, without raising your voice to the point you can feel stress in your body., Make a conscious effort to speak slow during class discussions. Talking too fast makes you come off as a nervous. Try to speak slowly, pronouncing your words one at a time. This will allow you to get your words out in an understandable manner.It may feel awkward at first. Many people, when nervous, speak fast.
If you're giving a longer answer, pause between paragraphs. This will help listeners absorb your words., If you want to be the loud kid, avoid using an affected or false voice when speaking in class. Speaking in a voice that is not your own can strain the vocal cords. If you're working to be the loud kid in class each day, you do not want to put stress on your voice. This will get tiring fast. Speak in your own voice clearly and distinctly., Oftentimes, people are hesitant to be wrong as they fear their own faults. Keep in mind everyone gives a wrong answer on occasion. If you want to be loud in class, and abandon any fears of public speaking, you have to risk being wrong. Remind yourself all your classmates have given wrong answers on occasion, and that the teacher will appreciate you trying even if you're not right every time., Another step to becoming the loud kid in class is working on being more outgoing. In addition to speaking in class, you'll want to branch out and talk to other classmates during downtime. If you're shy by nature, or otherwise nervous, becoming outgoing can be a challenge. Go slowly. It can take awhile to get used to putting yourself out there and socializing.Take small steps forward. Smile at a classmate in the hallway. Say ""Hi"" to a classmate at lunch.
As you progress, try not to back down. You may be tempted, for example, to turn away at the last minute when approaching a new table during lunch. Resist this urge. Succumbing to shyness will only reinforce it, so try to follow through.

, As with any behavior, being outgoing takes practice. If you practice engaging in social behaviors, like small talk during class, they'll get easier.Try practicing with your existing friends. You guys can role play scenarios in which you make small talk with kids from your school. You can also work on talking before the mirror. It may feel silly, but you may gain confidence by having mock conversations with yourself.
Practice in real life. Outside of school, chat with the cashier at a local coffee shop. If your parents have friends over, say ""Hi"" and ask them how their day is. The more you practice social behaviors outside of school, the more comfortable you'll feel being loud in the classroom.

, If you want to be more outgoing in class, it may help to join some extracurriculars. Pick activities that interest you and attend meetings. You may feel like you can be yourself when socializing with those with shared interests. If you meet people in after school clubs, you'll have a social network in your classroom. This can allow you to feel comfortable talking to others, allowing you to be loud in class.It may take some practice before you feel comfortable talking during extracurricular activities. However, it's important to give yourself a chance. Think of conversation starters before a meeting. For example, write down questions like, ""What's your favorite subject in school?""
Once you've formed a group from extracurriculars, you'll have someone to talk to during class. You can talk, joke, and be loud together during downtime at school.

, Self criticism often prevents people from putting themselves out there and becoming outgoing. Try to remind yourself it's okay to feel nervous or awkward at times. Everyone is insecure, and it's inevitable you'll sometimes feel nervous when trying to become louder and more assertive in school.A good way to curb self criticism is to imagine a friend or loved one criticizing themselves the way you criticize yourself. Try to imagine how you would talk a friend out of nervousness or shyness. Then take your own advice.
If you're less insecure, and more accepting of the fact you'll sometimes feel awkward or out of place, you're far more likely to relax and socialize more. This can result in you feeling more comfortable being a loud student in class.

, While you may want to be seen as the loud one, you don't want to talk out of turn. Talking without raising your hand can get you in trouble with your teacher. Also, other students may get irritated if you're constantly interrupting. Wait until other students finish their sentences. Only talk when your teacher calls on you, and always raise your hand first.

, It's not always a good idea to talk during class. Avoid talking during moments where you may get in trouble for being loud. Do not talk during class lectures or during student presentations. Avoid the temptation to whisper to your friends. While it can be fun to be the loud one in class, you do not want the role to land you in detention.

, If you're a louder person by nature, people may not always want to listen. Make sure to stay in tune to social cues so you can catch when you're talking too much.Watch body language. People may break eye contact. They may fiddle with something or seem otherwise distracted.
Also, pay attention to what the listener is saying. If they're responding with only ""Okays"" and ""uh-huhs,"" you're probably talking to much. You should allow the other person to speak.

, You want to make sure you listen as much as you talk. Being loud can get annoying if you dominate the conversation. When other people speak, genuinely listen to what they say. Do not simply plan your own response ahead of time. Also, encourage conversation. Ask people open ended questions, like, ""What's your opinion on this subject?"" and ""What do you think about this topic?"" If you provoke conversation and discussion, this can help solidify your reputation as a loud student without people thinking of you as dominating or difficult."

Introduce yourself at the first opportunity.,
Put on a happy face.,
Keep a positive attitude.,
Volunteer to help out.,
Assist other students.",How to Make a Good Impression on Your Teacher1," Talk to the teacher for a minute or so if possible. This shows that you aren't afraid to socialize and that you have confidence. Most teachers like a student with a lot of confidence. Try to find something you both have in common.Walk up to your teacher confidently, make eye contact, extend your hand, and say something like “It’s nice to meet you, Mr. Reed. I’m Jane Smith, and I’m really looking forward to Algebra class this year. Actually, I think you had my older brother in class — do you remember Joe Smith?”;
, Smile at every reasonable opportunity. Teachers love happy students. It is important to look like you’re enjoying yourself (even if you're not always!) during class.Some people recommend “dressing for success” as a student — that is, wearing slightly more refined, stylish clothes than comfy sweats, etc. — in order to make a good impression. This is an option, but a nice smile is the easiest (and cheapest) way to make a good visual impression.

, Things aren’t always going to go your way, in class or outside it. Don’t let temporary setbacks sour your mood and appearance, though. Do your best to avoid complaining, whining, or frowning. Teachers (like the rest of us) find it easier to get along with a positive person. Negativity spreads, but being positive spreads, too.If you get a “C” instead of the “B” you expected on a test, don’t gripe and groan about it for the whole class period. Use it as an opportunity and motivation for improvement, and let your determination and confidence show.

, Don’t be shy. If the teacher asks for a volunteer to hand out study sheets or clean the chalkboard, raise your hand. And do it with a smile. Show the teacher that you’re engaged in class and dependable.You can even offer to help out without the teacher asking for volunteers. It’s best to do this discretely, either before or after class. Otherwise, other students may become annoyed with you. Also, don’t insist upon helping out when the teacher says “Oh, that’s OK” — or you may begin to frustrate the person you’re trying to impress!

, Teachers are always outnumbered in the classroom, and therefore are almost always receptive to a helping hand with students who need a bit of assistance. If you have a knack for the topic being covered or the current activity, offer to help out another student who is having a more difficult time. Be considerate, though — don’t force your “help” upon a hesitant teacher or an unwilling student.For instance, if you’ve finished with your classroom lab project, go up and ask your teacher if you can give a bit of assistance to a classmate who seems to be struggling with the project. Or, offer to do some peer tutoring outside of class if you’ve really got a good handle on the material.

"
Talk to your teacher.,
Ask your teacher how you can do well in the class.,
Learn to understand their teaching method.,
Keep a teacher pro/con journal.",How to Learn to Like Your Teacher1," In many cases, a short discussion can clear up the entire conflict. You may have misinterpreted your teacher’s behavior, or you could be unaware of something you’re doing that is irritating or frustrating to the teacher.


Ask your teacher if there’s a convenient time you could talk in private.
Always be polite and show respect. If you go into a meeting angry or upset, the conflict is less likely to be resolved.
Bring specific talking points with you, so you can be as clear as possible. It’s best to say something such as, “On Friday, you seemed frustrated that I didn’t understand the subject, so you called on me 3 times. That was embarrassing to me, and I still don’t feel I really understand the topic.” Rather than, “You always call on me when I don’t know the answers.”
Ask a friend or family member to practice the discussion with you beforehand.;
, Teachers have years of education and experience in the subjects they teach. Since learning more about this topic is the purpose of your relationship, reaching out to discuss the best ways to succeed in the classroom shows your teacher you care, and will likely give you the opportunity to see the instructor at their best., Sometimes, the reason you don’t like your teacher is the way they run the classroom. If you’re used to a very relaxed class, learning to thrive in a strict environment is difficult and vice versa. In most cases, giving yourself time to adjust to this new style of teaching is adequate. However, if you’re still struggling several weeks into the class, approach your teacher and ask for help., One way to change negative thought patterns is to make yourself explore the positive side of the situation. A great way to do this is keeping a journal where you enter one negative thing that happened in class and one positive each day. This shifts your thought process from fixating on the negative aspects of your student-teacher relationship to considering both positive and negative equally."

Come to class ready to learn.,
Participate in class.,
Stay on track with your work.,
Study diligently.,
Ask for help when you need it.",How to Make a Good Impression on Your Teacher2," Before school begins for the day, make sure you’ve completed all your work and have it ready to go. Before class begins, organize everything you need and prepare yourself mentally and physically to listen and participate. Have your notebook out, your pencils sharpened — or your laptop fully charged, whatever the case may be., Actively participating — by asking and answering questions, working diligently, and so on — shows that you are trying your best to understand what your teacher is talking about. It also indicates that you are prepared and listening in class.Don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand something. Your teacher will be more than happy to help you. This implies that you want to learn and that you strive to do well in school.
However, it is possible to ask too many questions — if you seem to be interfering with class or frustrating your teacher, jot down your questions and bring them up after class or (if available) by email, etc. Generally speaking, though, it is better to ask too many questions than too few.

, Constantly falling behind on assignments, homework, and projects does not create a good impression. But doing your work on schedule — or even a bit ahead of schedule when possible — shows your teacher that you’re giving an honest effort to succeed.Dedicate yourself to turning in assignments on time. Late work can result in punishments, and your teacher won't be happy either. Turning in your first assignment late isn't a good way to make a good first impression. If you’re having trouble keeping up due to the difficulty of the work or some other factors, talk to your teacher about it immediately.

, Work hard in preparation for tests. If your studying results in A's on every test, great. But even if your hard work doesn’t achieve those highest marks, your teacher will take notice of (and appreciate) your ongoing effort toward improvement.If your studying doesn’t seem to be producing the results you expect, seek out advice on improving your technique. Teachers are usually eager to give out study tips — but you have to ask first.

, Seeking out study tips is one of many ways to ask for advice and assistance from your teacher. If you just can’t wrap your brain around a certain formula, or comprehend what Hamlet is talking about in that soliloquy, don’t be too proud or too embarrassed to ask for your teacher’s help. Most teachers entered the profession because they wanted to help kids learn — so give them the chance!


Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It shows that you are determined to give your best effort — and teachers value all-out effort from students above practically any other quality."
"
Know and obey the classroom rules.,
Avoid tardiness and distractions.,
Listen attentively to your teacher.,
Tell your teacher about problems in class.",How to Make a Good Impression on Your Teacher3," Be on your absolute best behavior, especially for the first few weeks of school. Sit quietly. Don’t pass notes. Keep your phone silent and in your bag. Always raise your hand before speaking. Put your lab equipment away properly. Ignore the lovebirds whispering sweet nothings to each other behind you.Don’t test the rules to see what you can get away with. Let some other kid do that. Focus on impressing your teacher with your knowledge of and adherence to the classroom rules. This demonstrates maturity, respect, and diligence.

, Don’t let yourself think that others’ conversations or hijinks give you license to do the same. Keep your primary goal — learning — in mind. Brush aside distractions, and never become a classroom distraction yourself.


You will be a distraction, and you won’t be ready to learn, if you show up late to class. Do everything you can to make it to class on time, if not early. Unless you have a truly legitimate reason for being late, don’t try to make excuses. Be as discreet and quiet as possible as you take your place in class, and give an apologetic look to your teacher., How do you know when it is important to pay attention? It’s a trick question: it’s always important — if you want to make a good impression! Having to ask the teacher to repeat something can be embarrassing and indicates that you don’t care enough to give your best effort.If you’re having trouble keeping focused during class, ask to be moved to the front row. This is especially helpful if other students are distracting you, or if you have any kind of hearing or vision difficulties. Talk to your teacher about other possible solutions if necessary.

, Nobody wants to be the kid who tells the teacher about every little thing other students do wrong — this is the easy way to get labeled the ”teacher’s pet” or a “snitch” by your classmates. So, yes, use your judgment in deciding what to report and what to let slide. But, when you know something disruptive or otherwise wrong is going on, report it quietly to your teacher.


Don’t raise your hand and blurt out “Mrs. Magowan, Sam and Max are talking instead of paying attention.” Instead, wait until after class and discreetly voice your concerns about the distraction they are causing you and others. If, however, Sam and Max are playing around recklessly with the Bunsen burner, inform your teacher right away.

Ask about your teacher’s hobbies.,
Participate in extracurricular activities with your teacher.,
Learn why your teacher chose teaching.",How to Learn to Like Your Teacher2," You may find out you have something in common, but regardless you’re sure to see your teacher from a different perspective. Remember you and your teacher both have lives outside the classroom, but you’re there to learn. Be courteous of your teacher and the other students, and don’t ask about their hobbies during class time.


Approach the teacher at an appropriate time, and say, “What do you like to do outside of class?”
If you happen to know about one of their hobbies, you can say, “I heard you enjoy gardening. Are you growing anything now?”
If you think your teacher may be interested in one of your hobbies, you could try something like, “I’ve been looking for a new book to read. Have you read anything good lately?”, Studies show that teachers are more likely to give you personal attention and assume you are intelligent, if they feel you have something in common. Participating in a club or other activity with your teacher creates common ground, and makes interacting with them in class easier.


Ask your friends if the instructor you're struggling with sponsors extracurricular activities.
Talk to other instructors about extracurricular activities the teacher in questions may sponsor.
Explore your school's website or other resources to find lists of extracurricular activities and their sponsors., Your teacher has years of education and time dedicated to learning about the subject they teach and how to best to teach it. Understanding why your teacher decided to dedicate their time to being an educator will make them seem more human in the classroom.


Approach the teacher at an appropriate time before or after class, not during.
Consider saying something like, ""I've always wondered why people become teachers. It seems like a difficult job. Why did you decide to teach?"""
"
Talk to your parents.,
Talk to a guidance counselor.,
Talk to a principal, superintendent, or the school board.,
Ask to be moved to a different section.",How to Learn to Like Your Teacher3," Before you decide to just drop the class or go to your principal, take a deep breath and go ask one of your parents or guardians for advice. They’ve had years of experience learning to work with people they didn’t get along with, and they can help you learn to do the same.


Ask your parent to schedule a parent/teacher meeting, but ask to be included as this makes it clear you want to be proactive in fixing the concerns.
Be clear and honest with your parents. Don’t give into the urge to exaggerate. This is likely to backfire, when the teacher tells their side of the story.
Write down specific examples of things that have upset you, and how you reacted. Ask your parent to evaluate these encounters, and offer advice on how you could approach the situation differently., If your parent isn’t helpful or you don’t feel the situation is being addressed following working with your parent, make an appointment with your school’s guidance counselor. It says it right in the name – they’re there to guide students by offering counsel, advice. Your guidance counselor will be happy to help you resolve classroom conflicts., If you’ve talked to the teacher, your parents, and a guidance counselor, and you’re still having trouble in the classroom, it may be time to go to your teacher’s superiors for help. This should be avoided whenever possible, but there are some situations where it’s inevitable.


If unethical behavior occurs, you need to seek help from higher authorities right away. For instance, cases of verbal and physical abuse are unethical, and should be reported immediately.
If unprofessional behavior occurs, such as not including you in classroom activities, which adversely affect your grades, you will likely need help from your principal.
If you feel unable to learn and your grades are suffering despite your best efforts, ask for help from your teacher’s superiors., This should be the last course of action. If the classroom environment doesn’t improve after trying to get to know your teacher, focusing on learning, and asking for help from others, it might be time to switch to a different teacher or take the class at a different time."

Your teacher will be impressed that you made the extra effort. The other students don't need to know you turned in a different type of project, so they won't think of you as the teacher's pet.Use a free online service like Powtoon to create digital book reports and presentations. Start with one of their templates, and customize them to fit your project.;
, Don't write about the same thing half the class will choose. If you make your work stand out by doing something different, your teacher will be impressed.Brainstorm to think up unusual angles for the topic. Set a timer for a set amount of time – say, 30 minutes – and do some internet research. Collect a list of possible ideas, then choose the best one.
Try freewriting. Get a pen and paper, and let your thoughts flow freely. Write down anything that comes to mind. You may be surprised at the ideas you come up with.

, When trying to understand a new concept in a class, try looking at it from different perspectives. If you need to research a topic for a paper, consider different angles before settling on one idea.Describe the subject in minute detail. Include every little part of the subject, and try to find the most interesting things about it. What makes this subject different from others that are similar to it?
Trace the subject's history. Describe how this subject has changed over time, and find specific moments or events that changed it.
Map your subject. Find a few things that are similar to your subject, and people or events that influenced it. How have other people approached your subject, and what were their thoughts about it?

, If you have a term paper to write, try to include a brief personal interview. Most people are flattered to be asked for their opinions, and they won't mind giving you a few minutes of their time. Few students take the time to do this, and it will make a very good impression on your teacher.


If you are doing a paper on the Gulf War, contact your local veterans' office and see if they can hook you up with a soldier who was actually there.
If you are writing about gun control laws, call or email the local chapter of the NRA and ask if they can give you a quote for your paper.

, Your teachers don't want to give you a bad grade – they would far rather have a reason to give you a better one. Ask if you can turn in an extra assignment for a few additional points.Ask your teacher if you can write a research paper, on a topic of your choosing or theirs. The other students won't be aware you're doing this, so you won't look like a teacher's pet.
Ask if you could put together a presentation on something the class is studying. Your fellow students will be aware that you're doing this project, but if you make it fun and interesting it may liven up a class period for them.

, If you have a big paper to write, don't put it off until the night before it's due. Try to at least get started early, so you will know early on if you're having trouble with it. If you absolutely can't finish a project by the due date, go to your teacher as soon as possible. You may be surprised at how willing they are to work with you., If you're having difficulty understanding something in class, don't wait until the last minute to ask for help – the longer you ignore it, the harder it will be to catch up.

, If you do better on an exam than everyone else, and the grades are posted, don't mention it. Don't be seen discussing the test with your teacher, and don't talk about class grades with the other students.Be especially aware of the “humble brag.” Saying things like, “I forgot to study, and wound up cramming for the test over lunch – but I got an A, anyway” doesn't make you sound smart. It just makes you sound like a jerk.
If you can deflect positive attention onto another student, this is even better. If a student or teacher praises you for a science project, for example, you could say, “A lot of the credit should go to – she was amazing at analyzing the data we collected.”

, Before and after class, talk to the other kids. Unless you have a reason that you actually need to be there, don't be seen visiting your teachers during lunch. Eat lunch with your friends, and speak with your teachers in class. If you hang out at the teacher's desk all the time, you'll look like the teacher's pet.If you need to speak to the teacher before or after class (say, about the results of a test), keep the conversation short and focused on the issue at hand.
Don't linger at the teacher's desk, or change the subject to social topics unrelated to your work.
If other kids can overhear your conversation with a teacher, be sure you're discussing assignments or tests. Don't be seen joking and laughing with the teacher all the time.

, If possible vary where you sit in the classroom each day, so you can talk to different people before class. Don't sit directly in front of the teacher's desk unless you have to – this will definitely make you look like a teacher's pet.

, If one of your classmates asks for your help with an assignment, make time for them. But don't offer to tutor a struggling student who hasn't asked you – they may be offended.

], If you keep up with the lecture and ask questions when you need additional information, your teacher will appreciate it. But if you ask a lot of questions during every single class, the other kids will think you are trying to be the teacher's pet., Few things are more distracting in a classroom than someone who is trying to text someone back without being noticed. Everyone will notice, it's guaranteed. If you make your teacher stop and ask you to turn your phone off, they will not be impressed.

, Make a point to smile as much as possible, without forcing it. Smiling makes other people feel more comfortable around you, and they will feel you are there for them and not for the teacher.

, Greet everyone, and try to be sociable. If you're a little shy, try to make more of an effort to initiate conversations. Sometimes being too quiet can come across as being aloof or snobbish, when that isn't what you intended at all.If you want to strike up a casual conversation before class, ask them about something you've heard them mention in the past. (“Did you catch Game of Thrones last night?” or, “Did you hear there's a new Hunger Games movie coming out?)
In English class, you could strike up a conversation about the reading assignment. “Are you caught up with your reading? I think I'm finally getting into this one...it was slow going, at first.”
It doesn't really matter what you say, as long as it's a neutral topic and you say it with a friendly tone of voice.
If you want an excuse for a quick exchange, ask your neighbor about last night's homework. “Did you get the answer to question 3? That one took me forever.” (Of course, don't do this if your homework is being graded – it will look like you're trying to cheat.)
Unless you know someone very well, avoid topics that might spark an argument, like politics or religion.

, Take the time to figure out who you really are, and have the courage to put your real personality on display. Your real self might be extroverted, confident, and charming. Or you might be introverted and bookish with a subtle, clever sense of humor. When you aren't pretending to be someone else, it's obvious to everyone you meet. Less evolved kids might tease you for being different, but most people will be impressed – teachers included.

Punctuality is a very important quality to develop and a sign of maturity that will be sure to impress your teachers., Teachers are people too. Taking the time to learn about your teachers and letting them get to know you is a great way to get in their good graces. This will impress your teachers by letting them know you care and that you pay attention to details.Try striking up a conversation by asking about personal details you already know like, “How are your cats doing, Mr. Smith?” or “How is Mr. Evans doing, Mrs. Evans?”
Look at the personal effects your teachers have on their desks. If they have a lot of pictures of mountains, ask them if they like to go hiking. Or tell them about a personal connection you might have with some mountains (maybe your family went there on vacation one summer?). Try making connections between yourself and the details you see about your teachers’ lives.
You can also give them a little card or gift during the holidays. A gesture of appreciation can mean a lot to your teachers. Just don’t make it too extravagant of a gift or your teacher will feel uncomfortable accepting it. A simple card, a box of candy, or a $10 giftcard would be an acceptable gift.

, Teachers are not impressed by bullies or students who get in trouble. Try to show your teachers that you respect them and your fellow classmates by treating others with kindness and generosity.

If you don't wear a uniform in your school, then don’t dress inappropriately. Wear clothing that meets your school’s dress code requirements. Dress like you would if you were going to church.This means collared shirts with slacks or nice jeans for boys and dresses (knee-length) or nice pants and a cute top for girls. Nothing should be overly tight or revealing.

, People are naturally drawn to others who appear friendly and open. This means that you should remember to smile in class, especially when speaking with your teachers.

Compliment your teacher on her positive attitude and energy.,
Create a presentation on how great your teacher is with your classmates.,
Tell your teacher’s superior about how great she is.,
Write your teacher a letter of appreciation.",How to Make a Teacher's Day1," Share words of encouragement with your teacher by telling her how much you appreciate her hard work and dedication. You can stand up in front of the class and compliment your teacher on a specific action she did that you appreciated or go up to her after class to let her know how much you appreciate her attitude and energy in the classroom.


Try to be specific when you compliment your teacher so it feels like you are not just throwing around empty words. For example, if your teacher gave you more time to complete an assignment due to an illness, you may compliment her by saying: “I appreciate that you were willing to be flexible about the due date and I feel like you have a positive attitude toward teaching that benefits me as a student.”
You may also compliment your teacher in a more general way by commenting on her teaching style and her approach to teaching in the classroom. For example, you may say: “Thank you for coming into class every day with enthusiasm and excitement. You are great at breaking down difficult concepts so I can understand them clearly. I really appreciate your teaching style and I feel like I am learning important, useful things in your classroom.”;
, You can also tell your teacher how much you appreciate her by creating a PPT presentation or a presentation on the board that describes how great your teacher is and why. You may want to collaborate with your classmates to create this presentation, as it will likely be even more impressive if there are several of you up there, telling your teacher how great she is.


In your presentation, list the ways in which your teacher inspires you as a student and the ways in which she brings learning and fun into the classroom. Have your classmates each contribute at least one to two reasons why your teacher is great so that you can present a long list that will surely brighten your teacher’s day.

, Tattle on your teacher in a positive way by letting her superiors know how highly you think of her. You could speak to the principal about how awesome you think your teacher is or to another person in charge.


It may be helpful to describe a specific situation where you felt your teacher went above and beyond. For example, may be your teacher worked with you after class to learn a difficult math concept that you struggled with so that you could pass the upcoming exam. You could tell the superior that you feel like this shows how dedicated the teacher is to her students and how the teacher sets her students up for success.

, Sit down and take the time to put all your positive feelings towards your teacher into a thoughtful letter. You can start the letter with a “Dear Mrs.X” or “To Mr.Y” and describe why you appreciate your teacher so much.Think about a specific time when your teacher has impacted you in a positive and thoughtful way. This could be something small, like asking how you’re doing, or something more significant, like giving you an extension on your deadline for an assignment. You can ask your parents to help you write the letter or try to do it on your own.

Bring in supporting material that relates to the class topic.,
Participate in class discussions.",How to Make a Teacher's Day2," Surprise your teacher by spending time after school with your classmates decorating her classroom door. Break out the colored paper, the colored markers, the glitter, and other fun decorations. You may want to spell out your teacher’s name on the door and draw a class mascot, like your class pet or another animal you know your teacher would like.Be sure to keep the decorations age appropriate and non-offensive, as the door will be exposed to the rest of the school and be seen as representative of your teacher’s class.

, Give your teacher a break by pitching in on classroom chores like photocopying classroom materials, feeding the class pet, cleaning up after class, or assisting with lunchtime duties. Show your teacher she can lean on her students to support her and give her a hand.You may also want to take it on yourself to organize a cleaning schedule with the other students and surprising your teacher with the schedule. You can do this for the feeding schedule for the class pet. Taking the lead on classroom duties can help to reduce your teacher’s stress level and brighten her day.

, Make your teacher's day by volunteering to go first for a presentation to the class, as this will save her the headache of having to force students to go first. This small act in class can show your teacher that you are engaged in the class material and energized about the assignment.

, Show your teacher that you have been paying attention to the class topic by bringing in text or video that relates to the topic to share with the class. If you are learning about creative writing in class, for example, you may bring in fliers that promote a poetry reading nearby to share with everyone or you may bring in a published poem that you like. Talk to your teacher before you share the material with the class, as she will likely be thrilled that you are engaged enough to bring in supporting material.

, Though this may seem like a small thing you can do, speaking up and talking during class discussions can often make it easier for your teacher to do her job.

Do this even if you are not absolutely certain you know the answer or have the right solution to the teacher’s question. Participating verbally in discussions will show your teacher you are engaged and make her feel as though she is reaching at least one student in the room.

Be aware of your body language.,
Thank everyone for their time and attention.",How to Give a Presentation in Front of Your Teacher," It is important to follow all the instructions your teacher has given. If there is something you aren't sure about, be sure to ask. 


What is your presentation supposed to be about?
How many minutes should your presentation last?
Should the presentation include a visual aspect as well? For example, should you have a PowerPoint presentation, a flip chart, or other props?
Are you allowed to have note cards in your hand while you present?;
, During the real presentation, it's best to present either from memory or using a few note cards; however, it can be helpful while making your presentation to write out what you want to say word for word. This will help ensure that you don’t miss anything important, and you won’t be struggling to find the right words later on.If you are creating a visual presentation, writing out everything that you want to say will also help you pick out important points to include in the visual part of the presentation.

, One of the most common ways that people create presentations today is using Microsoft PowerPoint. Create a slideshow and include a slide for each main point of your presentation. Remember not to overload your slides with too much information. Include one or two bullet points that make your main point. If you can, use an image that will enhance what you’re saying.


If you have been instructed to use a poster board or flip chart, then create your presentation using bold markers that will be able to be read easily from a distance. Consider gluing on images that help your presentation make sense. As with PowerPoint, make sure not to make your poster/flip chart too busy. You want your visuals to aid your presentation, not take over it. 
Keep the presentation simple and neat. Unless your teacher has given specific instruction on this, stick to fonts and colors that are neutral and easy to read, like Garamond, Arial, or Times New Roman.Find ways to use pictures that can illustrate what you are talking about with your words. For example, if you are presenting on an important battle in history, you might find paintings, drawings, or photographs and use those to help your listeners imagine the battle.

, Many times, people have prepared wonderful presentations only to find out that they aren’t able to open it on the day of the presentation because of some technical problem. It is a good idea to have your presentation (assuming it is an electronic presentation) saved and accessible in several different forms.


For example, you can save your presentation on one or even two different USB sticks, and you can also email the presentation to yourself. This way, you have a few different options for getting it open.

, Although it may seem silly to you, if you want to impress your teacher, you will want to look nice on the day of the presentation. If you have a school uniform that your school requires you to wear, make sure it is clean and pressed. If you can wear what you want, try to dress business casual on that day.If you’re giving your presentation late in the day bring your presentation clothes with you and change into them right before class. If you’re giving the presentation early in the day, come dressed for the presentation and then have more casual clothes to change into, if you don’t want to wear your nice clothes all day.
It is a good idea to lay out the clothes that you want to wear the night before. This way, you will know they are ready to go, and you won’t have to think about what you will wear at all on presentation day.

, On the day of the presentation, take a little extra time to look nice. Bring your toothbrush or some floss so that you can get anything embarrassing out of your teeth before your presentation begins.If you wear makeup, consider bringing a bit of makeup for a touch up before your presentation. You could also bring a comb or brush to make sure your hair is neat.

, Though it can sometimes be hard to sleep when you’re feeling nervous about something, do your best to get to bed on time. If you can’t relax, try having a warm cup of tea and do something that you find relaxing.


Try to make sure that your presentation is completely ready to go before going to bed. This will help keep you from laying in bed trying to remember anything you might have forgotten to take care of. Pack everything you will need for school including anything for the presentation before getting ready for bed.

, Before practicing in front of others, it can be helpful to practice on your own. The key here is to practice as though it were the real thing. Doing so will help you identify any major problems with your presentation. Try to make this practice as realistic as possible. Stand up next to your presentation, as you plan to stand during the real thing.You might not have access to a projector, but you can still stand next to your computer for practice.
If you are using a different visual presentation, set it up in the way that you plan to use it during the presentation. For example, hang your poster board on the wall.
In your first trial runs, you may find that you have to stop to fix major problems or to make notes of things you want to say. This is OK to do, but try not to get in the habit of stopping every time you have a problem. Practicing helps to work out issues, but it also helps you practice getting past mistakes as smoothly as possible.

, Even if your teacher has not assigned a maximum or minimum time limit, it is a good idea to time the presentation. This way, you will know how long your presentation is, and will also help you see whether or not you are consistently giving your presentation each time you practice.


You can use the timer on your phone or a stopwatch. If you don’t have either of those, try doing a Google search for “stopwatch” and you can use the built-in one on the Google search page. Alternatively, you can also just make a note of the time when you start the presentation and then see what time it is when you end the presentation.
Don’t forget to factor in a few minutes for potential questions!

, While you are practicing your presentation, do your best to work on memorizing what you want to say, and when you want to say it. Your presentation will be a lot better if you aren’t constantly looking down at note cards or searching a piece of paper to figure out what you want to say next.Keep in mind that memorizing, in this case, doesn’t mean having a word for word script in your head. Instead, it means that you know what you are presenting well enough to do it without the use of note cards. It’s OK if you say things a lit bit differently each time you practice the presentation as this will make you seem confident and natural.
If your teacher has said it’s OK, you could consider writing down a few points that you’re having trouble remembering on a small note card.

, Ask your parents or another family member if you can practice your presentation on them. Tell them that you would like them to look for anything that is unclear in your presentation, any nervous habits you might have while giving your presentation (e.g. fidgeting with your hands), and anything else that you can improve for your actual presentation.Keep in mind that if your parents are the type that think everything you do is perfect then they may not be very critical of your presentation even though it would help you. On the other hand, if you have extremely critical parents, try to take everything they say in moderation, and remember that they just want you to do well.

, It can be helpful to get feedback from different people. If you have a friend or classmate who is also giving a presentation ask them if she can help you practice, and offer to help her with her presentation in return.If you don’t have a classmate you want to ask, then ask a friend who you trust to be helpful with the presentation. Avoid asking a friend who you know will not take the task seriously.

, Ask the people that are practicing with to try and come up with different questions about the content of your presentation. Your teacher or peers may want to ask questions about your topic at the end of your presentation so it’s a good idea to have a bit of practice with this.You may not be able to answer every question that is thrown at you, and this is OK. If you get a question that you don’t know the answer to, do your best to tell them what you do know, and tell them you will find out the rest of the answer and get back to them., There are a few things you can do before the presentation to help calm your nerves — many of which you can even do right at your desk. Try breathing deeply; silently repeating affirmations (such as ""I can do this. I'm going to do a great job""); or using positive visualization (imagine yourself giving your presentation successfully and knocking it out of the park). These strategies can help you settle your nerves and go into your presentation feeling calm and collected.

, By going first, you get your presentation out of the way. You won’t have to sit through the rest of the class worrying about your presentation. People are also less likely to remember the first presentations. If your presentation doesn’t go well your teacher is more likely to forget your mistakes if he has seen many other presentations.


If you really don’t want to go first, try to go second or third. The earlier you can get your presentation out of the way, the better.

, Your teacher will probably allow you a few minutes to get set up for your presentation. During this time, open up your file on the computer (or set up your poster board of flip chart), make sure your note cards are in order (if you have them), and make sure that your clothes are in order (check that your pants aren’t unzipped).During this time, take a few deep breaths and reassure yourself that you’re going to do great. You’ve done everything you need to do to make your presentation go well.

, If you are in a very big class, it is possible that not everyone knows your name; therefore, it is a good idea to say something like, “Hi everybody, if you don’t already know my name, I’m . Today, I will be presenting about…”


Don’t go into too much detail when introducing the topic of your presentation, but try to get your listeners interested quickly. For example, if you are presenting about how to choose a college, you could say something like, “You may think that where you go to college isn’t that important; however, you probably don’t realize that where you go to college will have a huge impact on your life. It will have an impact on where you live, who you meet, and most importantly whether or not you can get the job you want.”

, If you have practiced enough, this shouldn’t be difficult; however, some people talk too quickly and too quietly when they get nervous. Try to remind yourself to talk slowly and loudly enough so everyone can hear you.If you’re using an electronic presentation, you can use each new slide as a chance to stop for a few seconds and recognize whether you are speaking slowly and loudly enough for everyone to hear.

, Even the best presenters make mistakes sometimes. If you do make a mistake or stumble over a word, don’t let that ruin the whole presentation. If you need to, take a few seconds to regroup, and start again where you left off.If the mistake was small, chances are that nobody even noticed it. If they did notice, they probably didn’t care too much. Remember that your teacher probably isn’t out to get you, and they won’t get mad at you for making a mistake.
You can also make a joke out of the mistake. For instance, if you stumble over the pronunciation of a word, then purposely mispronounce the next word or two after that and really get the room laughing. Smile and laugh about it yourself — being able to laugh at yourself shows confidence. Then continue with the presentation.

, Try to look around the room and make eye contact with various listeners for a few seconds. Don’t forget to also make eye contact with your teacher. During presentations, some people get nervous and seem to be staring at one point in the room or at the ground, which can be distracting for some people.If you are able to make eye contact for a few seconds with several different people over the course of your presentation, you will be giving the impression that you are relaxed and confident.
Don’t forget to smile!

, It might be hard to remember everything you want to say while also worrying about what you are doing with your body, but do your best to be aware of what you’re doing with your hands, and how you’re standing.For example, it’s OK to use hand gestures, but don’t overdo it. Use hand gestures where they fit naturally into what you’re saying.
Avoid crossing your arms or your feet; this gives the impression that you are not open to your audience.
Don’t fidget with your hands. When you are not gesturing, you can clasp them together gently in front of you or simply let your arms hang at your sides.
You don’t have to stand glued to one spot in the room, but don’t move around too much or too quickly. Remember that you are trying to convey a confident attitude.

, Once you make it to the end of the presentation, pause for a few seconds to signal to everyone that you have finished. Then end the presentation by saying something like, “This concludes my presentation. I want to thank all of you for listening so attentively. Are there any questions?”


If your teacher has instructed that there will be no question and answer portion, then leave out the part where you ask if anyone has questions.
Having a few closing remarks will bring the presentation to a more natural and less awkward close than if you simply stop talking and go to sit down at your desk.

,
Show your teachers how much you appreciate them.",How to Impress Your Teachers," Wash and iron all the clothes you will be wearing to school the next day. Dress uniquely, and most importantly, appropriately. A low cut tank or pants that are falling down to your knees may look cool to other peers, but not to your teachers. Think about what will get you further in life - impressing students or impressing teachers. Brush your hair, wash your face, and shower.;
, Don't be late, because in some schools if you're tardy too many times you get a detention, or you even get cut from the class. Being tardy to school shows irresponsibility, so aim for being early. If you happen to be late one time, don't make up excuses. Teachers can see through the acts - they've had to deal with tardy kids giving excuses for years.

, Just say a friendly ""Hello, how was your weekend?"" and talk a little bit about yourself, too. Teachers will be a bit friendlier to you if they know you're not just trying to get a good grade from them. Hold the door open for your teacher, and say hello in the hallways when you pass them. Never badmouth your teacher in public, no matter how much you dislike them. You never know who could have also been listening, and if the wrong person hears, word will get back to your teacher.

, Be prepared for anything. Bring at least two pencils, two pens, an eraser, highlighter, post-it notes, loose-leaf paper, textbooks, and binders. Sharpen your pencils, clean your erasers and prepare other things as well. Remember to bring any other specific things your teacher asks you to bring every day, such as a calculator for math or a ruler for science. You should remember this important fact as well because you must take notes on whatever the teacher is saying or referring to so once you take notes, you can understand things better and it also encourages you to study. When you study, you can ace tests and get an A all the time and your teacher will be very pleased.

, This will prevent you from fooling around during class, and it helps you focus better than if you were in the back. Studies show that generally teachers tend to prefer the kids that sit up front, because those kids have the self-control not to fool around. Sit up straight and don't slouch. This gives your teacher the impression that you care and are there to learn. If you can't see the board, consider glasses or contact lenses.

, Only miss class when you really need to (i.e. chronically ill, high fever, surgery, family issues...etc.). Go out of your way to tell your teacher in advance and explain why you couldn't make it. Get the class notes, assignments, and homework from friends in the class and make up all the work. Remember to show everything you did to your teachers when you get back.

, While the teacher is talking, make eye contact, look at the board, and take notes - even if your teacher doesn't ask you to. Highlight, underline, or circle anything your teacher stresses or repeats in your notes. Clear away all distractions. Turn your mobile phone off, don't pass notes, don't listen to your iPod, or talk to people near you when the teacher is talking. If this is hard for you, it may help if you sit away from your friends.

, Ask related questions and make comments on what your teacher is talking about. Aim to participate at least three times per class a day. Don't dominate a class discussion - teachers aren't looking for attention hogs. They want everyone to participate. Don't be afraid to ask the teacher to stop and go over a topic again. Most teachers will respect you for admitting that you didn't understand everything.

, This is especially useful to do in the days before a big test or exam. If you felt very confused during class then devote at least half an hour after school to pop into your classroom and ask for a recap and explanation on what was discussed in class earlier. Remember to ask in advance if you can stay after, because your teacher may need to go somewhere immediately after school/class.

, Homework can be a big chunk of your grade, and one big assignment can raise or lower your final grade for the class. Manage your time, and do your homework as early as possible. If you ever happen to forget to do your homework, then do it, and turn it in as soon as possible. Even if you don't get any points for turning it in early, you will have gained a degree of respect from your teacher, and you will know the material a little better.

, Ask if she needs help on anything.

, Don't pick on people. Don't be mean. Help new kids find their way to class. Being a nice person helps your reputation with everyone, not just teachers.

,, You can try giving them a small gift or writing them a thank you note.

Thank your teacher for their service.",How to Have a Good Relationship with Your Teacher," Your teacher likely arrives to work every day very early, perhaps even before the sun is shining. Every day, they have to work with dozens and sometimes even hundreds of different students, many of whom have bad attitudes. Greeting your teacher with a smile and a warm remark every morning is a great way to sow seeds of positivity in your relationship and to improve their day.


Smile and say “Good morning” or “Good afternoon” to your teacher.;
, Another way to establish rapport with your teacher is by being consistently punctual to class, never arriving after the bell rings, and always being in your seat once class is about to begin. This will allow your teacher to see you as a dependable and reliable person who is respectful of their time.


Arriving late can often indicate a lack of respect for the class and for your teacher’s time, as your late arrival can disrupt learning.
If there is any work on the board that you are supposed to begin, like bell work or a starter, go ahead and complete that. Your teacher will appreciate if you are on prepared for class to begin.

, Though you may see many of your classmates show disrespect to your teacher, work very hard to not become one of these people. Your teacher has been hired to guide your education and to help you gain important knowledge that will be useful to you in life. Respect this and do not argue with them, but do ask questions if you are confused about something.


If you feel that your teacher is wrong about something, present it to them after class and not in the presence of others.
For instance, if you received a C on your report card, but you have only received A’s and B’s on your homework and tests, you might want to talk to your teacher. Say something like “I’ve really enjoyed your class so far this year, but I noticed that my report card grade doesn’t correspond with the grades I’ve earned in your class and I wanted to see if you could check into this for me?”

, Your teacher likely has a set of rules that you must abide by in class, in addition to the school rules that exist for the larger campus. Be sure to make a note of these rules and to keep them without question. If your teacher feels that you keep yourself out of trouble, they will view you more positively and your relationship will strengthen.


For instance, many teachers have rules about not chewing gum or eating in class. Use your time between classes or during lunch to do those things if your teachers do not allow them.

, Perhaps you and your teacher have gotten into a spat in the past and now they do not have a great opinion of you. Before you develop a good relationship with them, you will need to apologize for whatever you have done to offend them. Apologies can go a very long way in repairing a relationship and your teacher will respect you for taking responsibility for your actions.


You can apologize by waiting until class is over and the other students have left. You can say something like “I wanted to let you know that I am sorry for what I said to you. It was very rude and offensive and you didn’t deserve that at all. I hope you can forgive me.”

, One of teachers’ biggest pet peeves is students who talk during class when they are trying to teach. It is disruptive and rude and is a bad habit that should be avoided at all costs. Anything you need to say to a friend can be said after class or during a break. Should you have a question about the lecture or classwork, raise your hand and ask your teacher instead of asking a friend.

, Your teacher has likely spent quite a bit of time preparing for this lesson, and it is important in assuring that you do well on your final exams. Pay attention to the lesson and take notes on important points that your teacher makes. Treat the information like it is of interest to you and your teacher will respect you for it.


Get a proper amount of sleep the night before, at least eight hours, to ensure that you are alert and ready to learn.

, More often than not, teachers appreciate students far more for being reliable and dependable workers than they do for sucking up. Your teacher does not need you to flood them with compliments, but they do need you to turn in your assignments when they are due..


Make sure your assignments are neat and presentable. If your handwriting is bad, consider typing some assignments.
Take your time on your homework, avoiding simple mistakes.

, Your teacher’s main desire is that you learn and are productive in their class, but you cannot be productive if you don’t understand the material or are confused about something. Should a question arise while they are teaching, raise your hand and ask it. Your teacher will appreciate your honesty and willingness to seek their guidance.


Go to tutoring if necessary. Your teacher likely provides tutoring hours after school. Take advantage of this if you are having significant difficulties.

, Another way to gain the respect of your teacher is to study the material. If you know the information well, when your teacher asks questions of the class, you will be able to answer them. Studying is also a way to improve your grade in the class and will impress your teacher when they are grading your tests and homework.


Don’t answer every question the teacher asks; you want to give others the opportunity to engage as well.

, Take some time to learn some additional information about the subject matter that your teacher is teaching. Your teacher likely has a strict lesson plan that they have to adhere to, but their interest in the subject likely extends beyond that. Take some time to research information that is not in your textbook and talk to your teacher about it after class or incorporate that information in a paper that you are assigned.


For instance, if you are taking a history course on the Roman Empire and you learned about Julius Caesar but are interested in learning more, do so on your own time.

, If your grade in the class is not the best, or even if you have a great grade but are looking for some extra points to boost your GPA, ask your teacher about extra credit options. This will indicate to your teacher that you are serious about your studies and about the information they are teaching you. This is a win-win as well because your grade will improve as a result.


You might say something like “I feel that I’m doing pretty well in your class, but I think my grade could be a little better. Are there any options for extra credit?”

, Another way to build rapport with your teacher is to help other students in your class. If your teacher has assigned group work, and your group is confused about the information, explain it to them if you understand. Your teacher will appreciate that their own lessons have empowered you to teach others in return.


Don’t cheat. If someone asks you to help them study for a test, that is okay, but if they ask for your help on test day by copying your answers, you should refuse.

, Beyond your academics and your dedication to the class, you should strive to make your teacher respect you as a person and admire your character. One way to do this is to always be honest, even if honesty will not benefit you or if their are consequences. Though lying can sometimes be appealing, it can also blow up in your face should your teacher find out the truth. Honestly helps to establish trust and respect in a relationship.


Perhaps you have seen a student being bullied and your teacher asks you what you saw, but the bully is your friend. You should still be honest in this difficult situation, though it may get your friend in trouble.

, Model respect for you teacher at all times. Unless they have asked you to, never refer to your teacher by their first name, but always place a “Mr.” or “Ms.” in front to express the proper deference to them. Remember that they are your elders, even if they are not much older than you and they are in a position of authority that deserves recognition.


If others are disrespectful to the teacher, stick up for them. Maybe your friends bash your teacher when they are out of class. You can try saying something like “I recognize that they can sometimes be frustrating, but I also think that the job is frustrating. You all should try to be more empathetic. They’re doing the best they can to teach us.”

, Show kindness to your teacher whenever possible. If they look upset or you notice that they have been crying, ask them if they are okay. Remember that your teacher is a person first and a teacher second and respect that they have feelings, emotions, and issues just like you.


Maintain boundaries, however. Do not buy your teachers things that are expensive and don’t try to hug them.

, If you demonstrate how to be a good student and a good person to your classmates, your teacher will develop further trust and respect for you. Work every day to model good behavior to your peers in hopes that they will follow suit. You never know if your own positive demeanor could change the vibe of your entire classroom. Do you best to shine your own light to your peers.


Stick up for people when they are being bullied.
Stay away from drugs and alcohol.
Don’t curse.
Try to smile a lot and keep a positive attitude.

, Your teacher has one of the most important jobs in the world and yet likely receives very little credit for it. Often teachers are paid very little even though they put in a significant amount of time and work. Take some time to thank your teacher for their hard work and to acknowledge how much you appreciate them.


You might say something like “I wanted to let you know that I think you are a wonderful teacher and I am so grateful for all that you have taught me this year. I have learned so much and that would not have been possible without you so for that, I thank you.”
You could write it in a card at the end of the year and give it to your teacher in appreciation if you don’t want to tell them verbally.

Introduce yourself.,
Be punctual.,
Attend lessons regularly.,
Dress appropriately.",How to Impress Your Dance Teacher1," When you begin taking a new dance class, make a point of introducing yourself to the instructor. Not only is this polite, but it sets you apart from other students and creates a rapport with the teacher. Make sure to introduce yourself at a moment that is convenient to the instructor (i.e. not right when they are trying to start the class, or when they are busy with another student)., Being punctual for your dance class will show your instructor that you value their time and respect their classroom. Walking in late may distract the other students from the lesson and disrupt the flow of the class. If you are late, enter the classroom as quietly as possible and wait until an exercise or routine is completed before joining your classmates to participate., Keep up regular attendance to dance classes to show your commitment, enthusiasm, and sense of responsibility. If you need to miss class for any reason, inform your dance instructor as soon as possible and make sure to communicate that this will not be a regular occurrence.Poor attendance will mean poor training, which may affect the entire class by holding back its overall progression.For example, if one student can't master a movement in a ballet class, the teacher will not be able to teach the class to teach the class an enchainement, or combination of movements, involving this step).

, Make a good impression on your dance teacher by dressing appropriately for lessons. Come to class wearing minimal to no jewelry, proper dance shoes (if applicable), and appropriate dancewear for the type of dance class you're taking (e.g. tights and a leotard for a ballet class). Longer hair should usually be tied up or pinned into a bun."

Talk to your parents.,
Ask your parents to talk to others about their concerns.,
Try to treat your teacher with respect.,
Talk to other students.,
Remember you'll have many teachers in your lifetime.",How to Handle a Teacher Who Yells a Lot1," If your teacher has been yelling at you on a regular basis, the first step is to talk to your parents. It can be very difficult to address the situation on your own. Your parents want you to have a positive learning experience and will want to help you find a solution to the problem.


Express your concerns to your parents soon after a problem occurs. You want to be able to talk to them when an incident is fresh in your mind. Do not sit and stew for a few weeks, as you may forget necessary details.
Your parents may be skeptical at first. Try not to take this personally. This is not because they don't care, but because children frequently feel teachers dislike them or are mean to them. Try to explain the specifics of what happened. Tell them what your teacher said as well as her tone of voice.Your parents will want to know all the facts. They'll probably ask you a lot of questions about the incident or incidents. Try to answer their questions calmly, even though you may feel stressed out. Your parents might want to schedule a meeting with your teacher in order to assess the situation.;
, Oftentimes, a teacher simply has a reputation for being strict or difficult. Your teacher may also be going through a personal problem that's affecting her behavior in the classroom. Have your parents talk to your friends' parents to get a sense of whether other students have similar problems. The more information your parents know, the better they can address the situation in a meeting with your teacher.In some cases, your teacher may be unwilling to address the problem with your parents. In this case, your parents may have to report the problem to the school's principal. Having others back up their claims can help them make their case.

, While it can be difficult to respect someone who does not respect you, try to obey your teacher's rules. If your parents are discussing the issue with school officials, it may take a few weeks before it's resolved. During this time, try to minimize tension by respecting your teacher in the classroom.Try to follow any classroom rules. Do your homework on time, do not talk in class, and follow instructions during activities.
If you're struggling with something, approach the teacher in a way that does not upset him or her. For example, if you're struggling with an assignment, say something like, ""I'm having trouble with this math problem. Can you show me what I'm doing wrong?"" Your teacher may respond better if he or she feels like you're genuinely trying to learn and not just wasting time.Keep in mind some teachers just yell, regardless of how you're behaving. Such behaviors should be reported to your principal. Your parents should be able to handle this for you. However, in the meantime continue behaving respectfully. You want to be the bigger person in this scenario to avoid giving your teacher an excuse for his or her behavior.

, Sometimes, simply venting to others can help you cope with a frustrating situation. If your teacher yells to other students and not just you, talk it out with them.


You might not find a solution talking but mutual complaining can help you get through the day. Leaving your feelings bottled up can make them worse.
Be careful where you vent. You want to avoid complaining about a teacher on school grounds as you may be overheard. This can make the problem worse.

, Even after taking steps to address the problem, some teachers may still be difficult. It may simply be a problem of your personalities clashing. Your learning style may not match how your teacher conducts his or her classroom. Try to relax and get through the year. You will have many teachers in your lifetime. Even if you do not get along with this person, you'll find a better learning environment later on."
"
Try every movement.,
Pay attention.,
Be positive.",How to Impress Your Dance Teacher2," To convey your willingness to learn, try every move taught in your dance class, regardless of how difficult it may be. Do not allow your concerns about looking silly stop you from attempting and repeating certain movements - struggling with these movements will still convey your commitment to learning and impress your teacher. Giving up on your efforts to master a movement may convey disinterest and will likely leave a negative impression on your dance teacher., Once you are in dance class, give the teacher your full attention. Put away your phone and avoid talking to other students while the dance teacher is instructing you; this is rude and counter-productive to the flow of the class. Listen clearly to the teacher's instructions and emulate their movements as much as possible. Avoid holding up the class by slowing down a routine or missing a group transition in a choreography., It is important to approach dance class with an optimistic attitude. Dancers tend to be highly tuned to other people's energies, and a negative attitude can distract your teacher and classmates. Even if you're tired or having a bad day, make the effort to smile, persevere, and do your best in class."
"
Perfect the basics.,
Ask for help.,
Implement all suggestions.,
Practice outside of class.",How to Impress Your Dance Teacher3," There are basic steps and basic rules for each dance. To make the most of your dance lessons, you should perfect the basics to have a strong foundation to build on. A dance teacher will recognize when you've mastered these steps., If you are struggling to grasp your dance instructor's directions, ask for help as soon as possible to avoid falling too far behind. Since your dance teacher has to worry about keeping up the pace with a room full of students, the onus is on you to ask questions when you are having difficulty with a move or exercise. Learning to dance requires hard work, and part of that work involves speaking up for yourself when necessary., If your dance teacher personally offers you specific advice or instructions, be sure to implement them. Be conscious of their advice and practice the adjustment to your form or movements as much as possible, until it becomes second nature to you. Your dance teacher will appreciate the respect inherent in following their advice and recognize the effort put into doing so.Receiving corrections from an instructor is actually a compliment, meaning that they see potential in you; if you fail to listen to their corrections or react badly to them, a dance teacher will likely stop focusing this extra attention on you.

, Learning to dance should not just happen in the classroom, but in your spare time as well. Practice and repetition are integral parts of becoming a better dancer, and this extra effort will be obvious to your dance teacher. Clear out a large place to practice at home, or ask to practice at your dance studio outside of class hours; if there is a cost for using dance studio space, consider teaming up with other dancers in your class to split the price."
"
Pack it all.,
Finesse your style.,
Come in clean with neat, unwrinkled clothing.,
Make sure you know where parking and entrances are.,
Be confident.,
Act friendly.,
Smile often.,
Turn off your cell phone and don't use it in class.

,
Exhibit interest and try not to look bored.

,
Show diligence.,
Pay close attention to your teachers.,
Don't talk when you're not supposed to be talking.,
Show your talents.",How to Make a Good Impression on the First Day of School," Before school starts, make sure you're ready. Stock up on good quality school supplies. Start with a binder. Your binder reflects your personality, so get a good, durable one. Fit the supplies nicely with your binder. Buy supplies that match your style (plaid, striped, solid, marble, themed, whatever). Make sure all your supplies match and don't clash.

If you don't have a list of school supplies yet, bring a pen and some paper along. Also bring a book along in case your teachers want a silent period, so you have something to do.



 

;
, Appearance wise, go for your own style. A bubbly look is by far the most popular, and if you're a girl, start with nails. Most schools allow nail color, so try a splattered look, a marbled look, an M&M design, or Michelle Phan's waterlily nails. If you have a uniform, find loopholes by trying different hair accessories, necklaces, earrings, or scarves. If you don't have a uniform, try to match your clothes to your nails and accessories., Try to look neat but cool at same time. If you don't know the dress code yet, be sensible . Think logically about what you probably wouldn't be allowed to wear, like mini skirts or really short shorts. Be well-groomed with neat hair and nails, and brush your teeth. Before the first day, try to get a manicure and a pedicure. You can do your own at home as well, but try to pick out a softer, school appropriate color.

, Try to memorize or write down where your classes are so you won't be late in the future. If you carry a binder, put your schedule in the clear pocket.

, Walk into school with your head held high, smile on your face, walk with nice even steps, at an appropriate pace, and look like you're ready for school to start.

When you first walk in, be confident and act like you belong, but don't be cocky, rude or arrogant. Never the best start.







, Even if none of your friends are in the class, try to socialize with people you think could be potential friends. If you don't like someone, try to be nice. You don't want to start a rivalry with someone on the first day of school.

, This sets people at ease and helps them to warm to you.

,,, As soon as you enter your tutor room (registration room/home room) take a seat straight away - it would be best to sit close to or in front. That way you show that you are interested in what you're learning.

, Listen closely to everything they say and write down things like classroom, homework policy, and testing expectations. If they ask any questions, try to raise your hand so that your teacher will remember you as someone who participates in class.

, Be respectful when others are talking.

, Show your strengths to your friends and classmates. If you are a good singer, pick out some fabulous songs during holidays and sing them to your friends on the first day of school.


Don't overdo it. For example, if you force your classmates to listen to your songs they will get bored. Don't sing for them if they don't want to hear it or they may avoid you.
Do not be arrogant, your awesome talents may not be appreciated if you come on too strong. Do not be rude or you may make enemies.

"
Ask your child for clarification.,
Investigate the problem.,
Schedule a discussion with the teacher.,
Stay calm.,
Look for a solution.",How to Handle a Teacher Who Yells a Lot2," Children often make generic comments. Things like, ""My teacher's mean to me!"" may not necessarily be a sign something is awry. However, if your child's been complaining consistently and seems stressed or worried in school, something may be wrong. When your child is complaining about a teacher, press him for details.


If your child says something like ""My teacher was mean to me today,"" try to get him to unpack that statement. Press him for details. Say something like, ""What exactly did your teacher say? What was happening at the time?""Children do exaggerate, especially when feeling miffed or wronged. ""Mean"" may simply mean the teacher scolded your child for doodling on his worksheet instead of completing his math problems. However, press for more clarification to be sure. Ask about the teacher's tone and her exact words. Even if your child was misbehaving, if his teacher raised her voice and used belittling language, this is a problem.For example, your child may say, ""She told me I was being a little brat and yelled at me to get back to work."" While your child was misbehaving, his teacher is the adult in the situation. Her response was not appropriate.

, If your child's version of what occurred seems inappropriate, you should investigate the situation further. Jot down exactly what your child said occurred so you have all the details. From there, do some investigation of your own. You do not want to get angry and confront the teacher until you have all the facts.


Check your facts. Your child may be exaggerating. You may want to call another mother and ask her to get her child's account of what happened.Talk to other parents. Some teachers have a bad reputation. If other parents have had an issue with this teacher, chances are your child is not exaggerating the situation., If you've determined there's an issue with the teacher, make an appointment to talk to her. Teachers are usually willing to talk to parents about issues in the classroom. Calmly give the school a call and request and appointment with your child's teacher.

, Even if you're angry, go into the situation as someone wanting to resolve a problem. If you enter the meeting yelling and placing blame, you're only going to escalate the issue. Use calm, inclusive language that's free of blame.


Start off the meeting by saying something like, ""My child seems to be having trouble in your classroom. I'm not sure I completely understand what's been happening, but I'm hoping we can work together to find a solution.""Even if you are calm and respectful during the confrontation, the teacher may get defensive. Many people do not take well to criticism, especially if they're frustrated or overworked. Stay calm if your teacher gets defensive. You do not want to escalate the discussion to the point it's no longer productive., You do not want to transfer your student from a classroom. A transition mid-year can be stressful. Try your best to brainstorm with the teacher on how the two of you can effectively solve the problem.


You may find the teacher simply does not know how to deal with your child. You could offer her some insight on how to help your child behave better in the classroom. Say something like, ""I know Isaac struggles to concentrate, but I think sometimes reminding him gently is more effective than scolding. It seems to work at home.""Also the teacher could just simply be a little grouchy and blunt and your child may be taking this personally. If this is the case, you can say something to your child like, ""Mrs. Donahue simply has a different way of communicating than Mommy and Daddy do. It doesn't have anything to do with you. Just try to behave in her class.""Ultimately, strive to leave the conversation with some ideas about how to move forward. Hopefully, your teacher will take your feedback as a learning experience and be better equipped to deal with your child.

Do not confront your teacher as a student.,
Make an appointment with the school's principal.,
Stay calm during the discussion.,
Consider transferring to another class.",How to Handle a Teacher Who Yells a Lot3," If you are a student, you do not want to confront your teacher on your own. If you talk to your teacher about her attitude when you're angry, she might get hurt. If she's already yelling in class, this can make the situation worse. If the problems warrant reporting, you should have your parents handle it., If you've raised your concerns with your child's teacher and nothing has changed, it's time to go to a higher authority. Contact the school's principal and make an appointment.


You should only take this step in extreme situations. Even if your child does not like his teacher, chances are he'll survive the experience. You can take this as a learning opportunity. You can teach your child that life is harsh and unfair sometimes, but you have to learn to cope.However, in certain situations it's important to report the problem. If you're teacher is yelling at students and using name-calling or derogatory language, this is a form of bullying. It's inappropriate and could turn your child and other students off of school altogether. A problem like this should be reported., As with your initial discussion with your child's teacher, it's vital to stay calm. You want the principal to understand what's happening is a problem. If you get angry or emotional, the principal may be less inclined to believe your side of the story.


It may help to recruit other parents. If this teacher is a problem in general, having others to back you up can help. The principal will see it's not just a problem with your student.
Be firm. For a variety of reasons, your principal may be hesitant to handle the situation. You need to make it clear that you'll continue to raise concerns until the problem is resolved. Explain, firmly, that you're worried about other students in addition to your own child., School officials are often very hesitant to transfer students to different classes. If a situation is not changing and causing your child distress, however, it may be the best option. Your child may do better in a different classroom where his teacher respects him more."

, They may have crucial information on it, perhaps regarding rules, the equipment needed, etc.

, If your school has a uniform, make sure it is washed, ironed, and by your bed. If not, make sure you choose clothing that is not too revealing, not too dressy, but make sure it doesn't look too casual either. Pack your bag. If you have a list of the things you need, triple check you have everything. You will need these sort of things:


Pencil case with suitable, useful stationery inside it.
A book
A notepad
Lunch/money
Your phone (Do not take it to class!)
A water bottle
Homework diary/schedule

,


If you want to put on some make-up, first check that the school allows it. There's nothing worse then being told off on your first day! If you are allowed make-up, only put on a little bit. Maybe some mascara and lipgloss. But don't overdo it. You don't want to come caked up in make-up on your first day!

, You won't be able to concentrate, and you'll be grumpy if you don't eat something. Even if you just grab a cereal bar, or some sort of fruit, eat something!

, Then you have plenty of time to walk to the station, and wait for the bus.


If you are being taken to school in a car, make sure you leave fairly early, to avoid being late on your first day. Again, leave early if you are walking to school.

, The first day is usually hectic, so don't be put off if you see students and teachers stressfully running around.

, No matter how friendly they seem to be, you don't know them well enough yet to trust them to that level. On the other hand, when getting your stuff from your locker, try your best to make friends who have lockers beside/above/below you. You will be seeing them a lot, so there's no point making mortal enemies out of each other!

, If this is the case, don't be shy. They will not take interest in you. However don't be overly confident either. They might label you as cocky. Just be friendly and polite, and remember to ask questions. People love to talk about themselves, and it makes you seem interested.

Both cases look great in a college application or when applying for a job., Your teacher may be a valuable mentor, provide guidance, or give another adult perspective when you need one. Get answers to questions you can’t ask your parents, ask for advice or general help with personal problems., Do you not get along with your teacher because you dislike the subject she teaches? Your relationship with your teacher can be affected if you don’t find the class engaging. Think of the class as step to the finish line. Whether your goal is graduating or making it to a prestigious university, keep perspective to help you get through a tough class.Find the practical value of a class you don’t enjoy. For example, if you hate math think about how you can use it to calculate how much money you need to save each month to get you a car before sophomore year in college.If you don’t like a class because the subject is difficult, ask your teacher or parents for extra help. If you mention your difficulties to your teacher, she may be able to provide you with another perspective to get you engaged. For example, if you are having problems with history she may assign you a project to work with your grandparents in order to learn about their experience with the war they experienced growing up as kids.

, You can learn more than just homework and class work as teachers know more than just their subject matter. Teachers can help you become a well-informed and insightful person. There will always be at least one teacher who will stand out and change your life. You won’t know who that is until you make a connection., While you may find class or homework difficult, you can always put in maximum effort. Make sure to submit everything on time and be on time for class. When in class, be respectful, stay alert, and ask questions to keep yourself involved., Your teacher has an obvious interest in the subject he is teaching so the more engaged you become in the subject, the more attention your teacher can give you. If you have a genuine interest in the subject your teacher may also provide guidance in making it a career path., Get extra help, ask general questions about how to do better in school or how to get a job, or ask about how you are doing in your teacher’s class. You may find that your teacher is easier to talk to when not in front of the class.Do not ask for a meeting if you do not have anything prepared. You do not want to waste your teacher’s time or yours.

, It’s impossible to get your teacher to like you if you don’t show up to clas. If you need to be absent, make sure to let your teacher know in advance or email her as soon as you are able. When in class, be attentive and participate. You should be a welcome presence in the classroom., Even if an assignment is not due for several weeks, study to ensure you are prepared and keeping material fresh. Don’t wait until the last minute to study or complete an assignment as your work will suffer. Include studying as part of your daily schedule., Don’t slouch when the teacher is reading and take notes as you follow along. Write down any questions you may have and ask them at the appropriate time.Slouching or lying on your desk can not only make you tired but it can also be seen as disrespectful to your teacher.

, Finding a regular studying location gets your mind prepared to work each time you arrive. Make sure that there is no noise and minimum distraction so that your work can have your complete focus. Try not to listen to music, talk to friends, or eat at your studying place., Don’t try to cram a lot of information in long study sessions as your memory won’t be able to retain everything. A great rule is to study two hours for each hour of class.Studying three times a week for one hour works better than studying once a week for three hours as you’ll be less fatigued and be able to concentrate better at each hour long session.

, Schedule yourself to finish papers and assignments several days early. Give yourself time to revise them and ask for additional help at your school’s writing center if you have one. You may even get friends to read it or get guidance from your teacher., Use your teacher’s office hours to your advantage. Your teacher has office hours for a reason as he wants to help you succeed. Come prepared with questions, even if they are about assignments due later in the year., While everything can be found online, the library is a great resource to help streamline your research. Talk to the librarian to help you find books, papers, or other resources for your assignment., Ask your teacher for helpful study tips. She may give you specific chapters to focus on. Assemble a study group to help support each other and test each other prior to the exam. Studying early lets you find the most effective study method that works for you., School should not feel like a chore. A happy and productive student is a great addition to any classroom. Your teacher will appreciate you if you brighten up her day with your enthusiasm and attitude., School can be stressful so join a club, sports team, or simply participate in activities like free movie nights to give yourself some relief from stress. Check your school paper or community bulletin board for activities or clubs that you can join.Becoming a well-rounded student also helps with job and college applications as well as helps with social skills.

, Whether you have a job or are in a club, you should not neglect your studies. Extracurricular activities are meant to round your out as a person. Make sure you prioritize your schedule.If you have a goal to save money with your job, make sure you can handle your workload and don’t over commit. While money is a great incentive for hard work, it is short-sighted to place material possessions over education.

, It’s difficult to get along with everyone all the time. Your teacher is a person with a unique personality. Learning to get along with different people is an important life skill. Learn more about your teacher until you find some common ground and work from there.No matter what your life goals are, you will always encounter people that you don’t completely get along with. Learning how to relate to your teacher can be invaluable moving forward. For example, ask about where your teacher grew up or what hobbies he likes. He may surprise with similar music tastes or similar religious background.

, Any relationship needs respect so don’t expect to have a good relationship with your teacher without showing her respect first. Be polite and courteous even if you don’t agree with your teacher’s opinion. Be a responsible student and let your teacher know when you need to miss class or when you will make up for a late assignment.Don’t think your time is more important than any other student’s. Showing initiative and being responsible for yourself is a great way to keep your teacher’s respect and keep you in high regard.

, Teachers will resent you if you are being insincere with your efforts to make a connection. Your teacher will be able to sense if you suddenly change your demeanor after asking for a college reference or a job recommendation., Your classmates will resent you if your actions are phony and your teacher may call you out in front of the entire class if she finds your actions to be too much., There may be rules for your teacher not to accept any gifts but it’s find to show your gratitude if your teacher has helped you. However, if you give him something expensive or flashy, that could send a wrong message and get you in a lot of trouble.It is a teacher’s job to help her students and your education and well-being is reward enough. While material gifts may seem like a good gesture, doing well in school and growing up into a productive member of your community is exactly what your teacher hopes for you.

, You may question a grade or ask to retake a test but don’t do this more than once. If you continually second-guess your teacher, he will see that as disrespectful and come to resent you. If you always knit pick about points for a grade, you may wear your teacher’s patience., Your teacher may be affected by something happening in her personal life. Don’t be quick to judge if your teacher seems to be off. Your teacher may be cranky, irritable or unable to concentrate because of job stress, family problems, or health issues.Conversely, don’t automatically assume your teacher is going through personal issues. Your teacher may become offended if you make false accusations.

, If you constantly butt heads with your teacher, keep in mind your permanent record will reflect all the disciplinary action that you have received. This may make it extremely difficult to get into college or get a job., Talking while the teacher is talking can be very disruptive. In contrast, sleeping, doodling, or text messaging can also be distracting and is very disrespectful to your teacher. When you do participate in class don’t be rude or try to be the class clown.There’s a difference between participation and being obnoxious. While making your classmates laugh may be fun, there is an appropriate time and place., Let her know why you feel your relationship is strained. For example say something like, “I feel embarrassed when it’s like you're trying to single me out"" or ""I feel like you only ask the same people to volunteer."" Try to work together to find a solution., If you don’t mesh with your teacher’s personality, get to know her and what she is knowledgeable about so that you find some common ground. There is a part of your teacher’s personality that you can use as a tool to help you learn. You will strengthen your relationship with her as you try to find that part of her personality., Perhaps this isn’t just an isolated incident. Talk to your peers and ask them for tips, tools, and create a plan to get along with your teacher. Sharing notes can help you get support and another perspective on how to understand a subject.If you’re too shy to talk to your classmates, watch what the successful ones do and try to mimic their actions. You’ll find that a lot of them ask a lot of questions and frequently participate in class.

, If you have exhausted all your resources and made a genuine effort to build a relationship with your teacher, ask your school guidance counselor or vice principal for help. They may be able to offer tips or act as mediator to help you and your teacher come up with a solution., Let your parents or guardians know that you are having problems getting along with your teacher. Let them know why you think your relationship is strained and what you have done to try to rectify it. Your parents or guardian may be able to meet with your teacher and better express how you’re feeling., If you encounter and physical or verbal abuse, like racist or sexual comments, report it immediately to your principal, parents, and even police. If your teacher is making you uncomfortable in any way you do not need to put up with it.Don’t keep your safety and well-being at risk or the safety and well-being of other students at risk by remaining silent. Your teacher should not be abusing his position so don’t feel intimidated or scared. Your principal, other teachers, and parents will all all put an immediate stop to inappropriate behaviour and you won’t have to deal with your teacher again.

Go through your closet and look at what you have now.,
The trick is to ""shop in your closet"", so you can have more clothes to work with through the year.

Be creative.,
Add emotion.,
Utilize sentence structures to your advantage.,
When in doubt, use movie quotes, songs, famous people (i.e.,
Use at least somewhat decent vocabulary.,
If you're too lazy to look up words in the thesaurus, right click it on Microsoft if you're typing your essay.

",How to Impress Teachers With Your Essay," The intro will make or break your essay. The key is to attract the teacher's attention away from the TV or computers screen and fully onto your essay. In the intro, be creative. Use an analogy, tell a personal experience story, whatever you do, start out with a something different!

, Teachers are human beings too! Any kind of emotion in the intro or conclusion (more likely in the conclusion) will get the teacher to start thinking. Talk about how your pet dog has been your personal hero in your life trials. Or fall back on the ol' reliable--hope. Talk about the hope to one day create a more peaceful world. Talk about the hope to one day reach that elusive goal. Remember, there is always hope.


If you talk about something briefly at the very beginning of your intro, refer back to it quickly in your conclusion. It'll remind your teacher you know how to write an essay and you know what you're doing.

, Start off sentences with the same start to add more emotion. Example: ""Sometimes the world gets too out of hand. Sometimes the world just needs a better hero. Sometimes, I can be that hero.""

, US presidents, class presidents, etc.), or well-known sayings. Either you can outright quote them, such as ""If we don't come together right now, on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed"" (Remember the Titans). Or you can change it up slightly to show off your creativity, such as ""The grass actually ISN'T greener on the other side.""

, By using too many simple words, the teacher may not notice it at first, but he will notice your lack of strong vocab. Insert a few good words here and there, and if you're slightly in doubt on what a complicated word means, just don't use it. Misusing a word can rip your essay into pieces in the teacher's mind.

Open a new document in Microsoft Word or another word processing software.,
Ask your parents, or check if your printer is running out of ink, so you know if you can make it colorful or not.

,
Make a title that says Clothes in a fun color,black, font, or word art.,
Under your title, select bullets to make your list look neater and easier to read.",How to Make a Back to School Shopping List2," Save it as 'Back to School Shopping' or something similar. Just save it in an easy to find folder so that you can easily find it when you're ready to print or if you need to edit your list. Also, if you have siblings, you might want to write your name in the document title.

,, Just make it happy and fun so when you go shopping you'll more likely to keep checking it. Make sure you make it 4 sizes bigger than the rest of the font. So, if you're typing in size 12, go with a size 16 title.

, Now, think about how many tops, jeans, and shoes you wear each week. This will help you change the guidelines below to fit your lifestyle. This is an idea about how much of things you will need.

"
"
4 to 6 pairs of jeans.,
1 or 2 pairs of sweatpants.,
For females, 2 to 3 skirts, depending on how often you wear them.,
If you are not in a hot climate, you can buy shorts, but only buy 2 pairs at most.,
You are going to need 10 to 15 comfy tees.,
Love layers?,
4 or 5 sweatshirts are a good idea.,
If you're a girl who's into skirts, 2-5 pairs of leggings.,
You'll need at least one pair of good-quality running shoes for gym class.,
Four to seven pairs of any type of shoe.,
1 pair of boots and 1 pair of slippers should be good in the winter.,
Try to make three fourths of your socks white and cotton.,
If you're a female who wear bras, and are running out, get 3 to 6 daily bras in neutral, grey, black, white, or any other color that makes you happy (underwear and bras can actually influence your mood!).,
In underwear, it's best to just mix it up.,
If you're a female, accessorizing depends on how often you like to accessorize.,
If you have pierced ears, stock up on earrings.,
Bags can vary a lot.",How to Make a Back to School Shopping List3," Try to buy them in all different washes, cuts, and styles. You can get them from the same store, just be sure there is something noticeably different between each pair. This way, you won't be buying jeans that all look the same! But if anything, make sure you have a tighter pair, a comfortable, slightly baggy pair, and that one pair that fits just right.

, Get one pair in a soft shade, and one in another color that flatters your skin tone and eye/hair color. These are great for lazy or sick days, when you're running late, just want to be comfortable, or cold days when you're not in the mood for jeans. Everyone needs a break! But make sure they fit nicely. Tight around the butt, but not too tight. Get pairs with drawstrings to adjust the waist size.

, If you just don't wear skirts, skip this step. If you're worried about people seeing your undergarments, try to get ones with built in shorts.

, Just wait until the spring-like is hot again, and then you should buy more. Also, don't buy them too short, or you won't be able to wear them after the first few weeks of school, due to weather issues!

, Try your favorite stores and second hand shops for things you'll like. Fitted tees are good if you think you won't grow out of them. Again, look in the clearance first. Some places can be really pricey though! Can you really afford 35-50 dollars for one shirt? You can buy 2 shirts in the clearance rack at a good expensive store if it fits your budget. The more the merrier, right?

, 3 to 5 plain, solid colored layering tees will sooth your layering addiction! These are just those plain-colored, but still fitted and cute, tees that can be repeated in a week without being recognized. They can also be accessorized as much as you like. Try to find 1 or 2 bright ones, and the rest soft and/or neutral shades.

, Some people have like to have 5 so they can wear a different one each day of the week. These are the most common way to stay warm in the winter and fall time.

, Try getting one heather gray, one black, one tan, one blue jeans, and the last one is up to you! Leggings are important because they go great with cute skirts and are comfortable on days when you just don't feel like wearing pants. Plus, since fall is right around the corner, it will suit the weather!

, If you don't have good quality shoes, you'll get blisters and be very uncomfortable. Running shoes can be all dirty, but they are comfortable. It's gym and fashion is not imperative. If you get really good shoes then its probably going to get ruined during track and field, or basketball, etc.

, Try to have 4 to 7 pairs of other shoes to wear outside of gym class. Try to mix it up with your favorite brands and types. Just make sure you feel comfy!

, If you want more than one pair, get one in a light shade and one in a darker shade.

, Try to get the other 1/4 in cute patterns, colors, and designs!

, You can also get 2 to 4 good quality bras in fun colors or designs, but make sure one is neutral. Get one strapless, and the rest is up to you! Find and try out different styles, colors, and brands.

, One option is to get colors that you love on your underwear, and the other is to get underwear in a matched set with your bra.

, So, if you rarely add anything to outfits, start! But stick with 1 or 2 pieces in each category. If you love accessorizing, embrace it, but don't go crazy!Necklaces are important. If no other jewelry, a girl should always have her signature necklace. That one you wear no matter if you're shopping or playing a sport. Try ones that you can find matching bracelets to go with it. Buy 2 belts, 2 sunglasses, tons of bangles and bracelets and a cute purse.

, If you put hoops in your first holes, then put tiny diamond studs in the second holes.

, Try to have one backpack for school. This backpack should be comfortable yet cool, have big pockets to put all your books in (and make it look like you don't have any books when really, its heavy), and have small compartments on the side to put soda, gum, sunglasses, etc. If you like messenger bags, by all means go ahead. I prefer not to use them because they put all the weight on one shoulder, and studies show that it will make your walk and posture lopsided. Why not make your backpack fun by putting key chains, signatures of your friends, drawings, and pins on it?

Memorize important historical names and dates.,
Learn your geography.,
Search Netflix for historical documentaries.,
Participate in class.,
Sit at the front.",How to Impress Your History Teacher1," History teachers are especially impressed if you know specific details like these, and they will help you keep facts straight in class. If you can't remember all the specific dates covered in class, at least be sure to know the order in which important events followed each other.;
, Get to know countries and capitals, as well as ancient countries and capitals. This will definitely put you at the top of the class, because most students today know very little about geography. Knowing the basics will also help you avoid making silly mistakes in class discussions, or asking a question about something you should already know.


Six months after Hurricane Katrina, 33 percent of US high school students couldn't point to Louisiana on a map, and fewer than half could find Ohio or New York.Despite US involvement in the Middle East, 63 percent of college students could not find Iraq or Saudi Arabia on a map, and 88 percent could not identify Afghanistan., Some of these are quite entertaining, and you may find you have more of a passion for the subject than you thought you did. Try to find an event or time period you are genuinely interested in. Stop by your teacher's desk about after class to ask their opinion about what you watched – it will definitely impress them.Try to find something that relates to the specific time period you are studying at the moment. You'll probably pick up some unusual facts to add to the discussion, that aren't covered in the textbook.
If you can't find anything related to your current class topic that interests you, watch a biography about a historical person, or something about a different period in history.
The trick is to find something that genuinely interests you – your teacher will be able to pick up on this.

, Channel your inner Hermione, and raise your hand in class. If you ask a lot of questions, your teacher won't call on you as often. You'll come off sounding smart for being inquisitive, and you won't have to deal with too many questions that you don't know how to answer. You will also be guiding the conversation into interesting directions, making class discussions more interesting for everyone, including you. Your teacher may even give you extra credit points for helping to keep the class discussions moving along.
At the minimum, you will at least get 100 percent on the class participation grade.

, If you can choose your own seats in a class, always try to sit in the front of the room. History classes tend to be more lecture-heavy than other courses, and sitting at the front may help you stay awake if your professor is having a dull morning.It's a lot easier to read the board and take notes from the front
Sitting in a front desk gives the impression that you are one of the serious students.
Students who sit in the front or in the middle of the classroom tend to score higher on exams.Bonus: teachers often like to call on students in the back of the room, to make sure they are paying attention. In a front desk, you won't have to deal with as many surprise questions.

Be a model student.,
Follow classroom rules.,
Develop a positive relationship with your teachers.,
Talk to your teachers about life outside middle school.,
Dress appropriately.,
Resolve peer conflicts.,
Be you.",How to Impress Your Middle School Teachers1," Follow school rules and show appreciation for the teachers and staff. Teachers will be impressed if you follow the rules, despite the many temptations to break them. Following the rules shows that you can respect what is deemed appropriate in a certain environment, even if you don’t agree with the policies.


School rules apply both in and out of the classroom. Remember that your teachers are not only watching you in class but also see you in the hallways and cafeteria.
Try showing appreciation for your teacher by saying, “Wow, Mr. Taylor, I like the way you decorated the classroom.”;
, Your middle school teacher might set his or her own rules or be given a set of standardized classroom rules. Either way, the expectations for the classroom are usually meant to help students do their best work at school. Your teacher will appreciate your cooperation when you consistently follow his or her rules., Be kind and greet your teachers every day. You do not need to be friends with your teacher, but you should develop a respectful relationship. That way, your teacher will be able to do a good job teaching and you are more likely to be a good student in his or her class.Be polite. Greetings are polite and show maturity. Remember to thank your teachers for the work that they do. Teachers will be impressed if you look them in the eye and say things like, “Good morning” or “Thank you for showing us that film.”

, It is normal to be wrapped up in your life as a middle school student. Remember that teachers are people that have lives outside of school too. Impress your teachers by thinking beyond your experience in middle school. You might have questions about high school or work life. Teachers will be impressed if you show the ability to discuss topics outside of what happens in the classroom.


You might ask your teacher about his or her life outside of school. Try saying, “Hey Mr. Taylor, how was your weekend? Did you do anything special?”, If your school has a dress code, follow it. If not, wear clothing that doesn’t distract from being an engaged student. Teachers appreciate students who dress appropriately because it makes the teacher’s job easier. No one likes to tell someone that their clothes must be changed.


Avoid clothes with profanity or drug-related references.
Make sure that your clothing completely covers your butt, thighs, and chest. Remember that your purpose in school is not to draw attention to your wardrobe or your body.

, It is natural to have conflicts with your peers (and with teachers too). Teachers expect this to happen, especially in middle school. It is truly impressive when students have a conflict but are able to resolve it before things escalate. If you have a social in a conflict in class, tell your teacher what is going on. You might be able to change seats or step out of the room for a moment. Teachers will appreciate that you talk to them instead of lashing out in the middle of a lesson.


Talk to your teachers about bullying. Having a positive relationship with your teacher can help you talk to them about bullying.If you are being bullied or know that someone else is being bullied, talk to a teacher or guidance counselor. Adults know that it is difficult to talk about being teased, so they will be impressed with your bravery.

, It can be difficult to show your true colors in middle school. It takes practice to be genuinely you! Students stand out when they are true to who they are, so try to accept yourself and let your personality shine.


Remember to be respectful of others. Being yourself is great, but it should not come at the expense of others. Remember to think twice about any hurtful actions or comments.

Learn about your teachers.,
Know who to watch out for.,
Be prepared for the cafeteria.,
Remember to stay good in school.,
Be ready to date!",How to Know What to Expect for the First Day of High School," Now depending on the school you're at, there could be more subjects and you'll have more classrooms! One for EVERY subject. Be ready to move around. To survive this, remember what classrooms they are in and where are they, and meet the teachers to make a good impression.;
, There are usually harder classes, strict teachers, and more classrooms! Don't worry: there are some advantages! More friends, a locker (hopefully), more freedom (hopefully!) and possibly a new hobby or experience! There will be a lot of differences, so go along with it and don't feel stressed about the change.

, Keep all your books and little fun things in there! You'll (normally) go there after each class to get your stuff for the next!


Have a small mirror for your locker. Preferably a magnetic one. Without a minute to spare between classes, it's going to be quite useful!







, If you have strict teachers, try to stay on their good side, hand in your homework, and be thoughtful.

, Don't mess with drama! If they do try to threaten you or anything, tell an adult you trust to help you with it.

, Try to make at least one new friend in every class and try to eat healthily on your first day.

, Do your homework. Make sure you study for tests! You don't need an ""A"" for everything, but a ""F"" on everything is not good! Put aside a good hour to study for before a big test, and take notes during class.

, Just be careful on who you're looking at! If you aren't too interested in dating now, don't worry about it for a while. Take your time and know that your person will come to you (but make an effort yourself if you want to date, too).

Also brush and floss teeth every day, being sure to use floss!",How to Make a Back to School Shopping List5," What you need to buy is a gel cleanser, a facial scrub, a moisturizer, and a spot treatment or cleansing pads. Optional things to get are at-home facials, pore strips, eye creams, and special washcloths/cleansers.

, Get a body wash for the shower, and optionally a loofah to go with it. Also look for a high-quality daily body lotion. Pick up some shaving cream and either a disposable razor or the kind that you need to replace just the heads on. If you prefer to, pick up a cream to remove hair. Wax is the best option for eyebrows, but if you get it done professionally, pick up some tweezers as well. Deodorant, perfume, tampons,body sprays and nail kits and lip balm are essentials.

, Such as mousse, gel, straightening/curling balm, etc. You should get a new brush and/or comb every 6 months or so, so go ahead and buy a wide-toothed comb and quality hairbrush, and a pack of bobby pins and hair ties and headbands . If you don't already have one, you might want to pick up a flat iron and heat protectant spray.

, And if you have braces, either get them in a discreet or cute color. Just no yellow, dark green, or orange. Don't get white, either. The comparison to your teeth will make your teeth look more yellow!

Make sure you understand the context.,
Choose an obscure topic when writing history papers.,
Come up with a strong thesis.,
Support everything you say with specific facts.,
Seek out more obscure source material.,
Add photographs, charts, and illustrations.,
Go digital.",How to Impress Your History Teacher2," Evaluate each part of the problem, and be sure you know what all the terms mean. History teachers place a lot of importance on context: the time period in which something happened, what was going on at that time, and the nationalities and personalities of the people who were involved. Be sure you always describe events in their correct chronological order – getting this wrong is a big faux pas in a history paper!


Why is this event, or time period, so important?
What are the most crucial elements of the situation?
Which people contributed to the situation being discussed?

, If your teacher allows you to pick the subject of a paper or an essay question on a test, the last thing you want to do is write the same thing everyone else will be writing. Your teacher will appreciate the novelty of reading something different for a change, and it will probably translate into a higher grade., Historical essay writing is based on a central argument, or thesis statement. This is your own, particular take on the subject matter, which you will then support in the rest of your paper.Don't simply restate the professor's assignment in your thesis – try to come up with something original on your own. If you really can't think of anything new, at least go with one of the less common interpretations.
To come up with a thesis, think about the instructor's question and ask yourself why it's important. Why do you think your teacher wanted you to research this topic?
A thesis isn't simply your opinion – it's more like the interpretation that you think is most likely true, after you do a bit of research. It's your spin on things, but one that you can back up with concrete evidence.

, Once you have your thesis nailed down, research your topic looking for those particular dates, quotes, and lists that are most relevant to your point of view. Then present this evidence in a way that clearly supports your argument.Always properly quote your source material, and create an accurate list of citations. If your history teacher sees one of their favorite books in your list, this will definitely impress them.
If you really want to impress your teacher, learn how to incorporate footnotes into your paper. A footnote is a way to back up your thesis by challenging the reader – in this case, your teacher – to check your source material to see how it supports your ideas. If your teacher isn't sure where you are going with part of your argument, this will help them understand your thinking.

, When writing a history paper, make an effort to seek out more unusual sources. Most of your classmates will confine their research to the first few Google results that come up, so everyone's answers will end up sounding very much the same. Dig a little deeper when doing internet research, or ask your teacher or librarian if they have any suggestions., Adding visual interest to your homework or research paper will go a long way in making it stand out from the crowd – too often, student history papers can come across as sounding a bit dry. Not only does it show that you put some effort into your work, it will make reading your work more interesting for the teacher.Be sure to make a note of where you found any photographs or charts that you include.

, If you are assigned a research paper, ask your history teacher if you can prepare a digital presentation instead. Create an eye-catching presentation with an online platform like Prezi.com, which is free to use for students. You can add interactive elements that will make your project fun to explore, and your teacher will be impressed that you made the extra effort.

Prepare a few questions tailored to your particular teacher.,
Work ahead.,
Listen to a few podcasts.",How to Impress Your History Teacher3," History teachers often have specific time periods or historical figures they are especially fond of, or types of situations they are drawn to. You can tell what these are by noticing what they most focus on in their lectures. Have a question or two ready to ask, in case there is a dead space in the class discussion. Your teacher will see that you've done the reading and put some thought into the material.


Your teachers will be grateful for your help in keeping the conversation going – those dead spaces are as boring for them as they are for the rest of the class.
Your teachers will either think you're interested in the same things they are (win), or they will give you props for paying close enough attention to figure out what they like most...either way, it's a win for you.

, To properly study history, it's vitally important to stay caught up on the reading – you need to understand each important historical event before you can understand why the next incident occurred. If there is anything you're confused about, or want to learn more about, you can ask your teacher if he or she has any suggestions for further reading. Your teacher will be impressed that you are looking ahead to the next lesson.

, There are tons of informational podcasts out there that put an entertaining spin on history, like “Stuff You Missed in History Class” or the BBC's “Rex Factor.” Search for episodes about specific historical periods or events that you will be covering in class, and pick up some obscure fun facts to drop into the class discussion."

Be on time.,
Be prepared for class.,
Participate in class discussions.,
Complete all assignments.",How to Impress Your Middle School Teachers2," Arrive at all of your classes on time. Remember that teachers talk to each other, so make sure you are on time to all of your classes.Let your teacher know if you will be late. If you know that you will be late to class, tell your teacher ahead of time. Bring your teacher a signed note from an adult if you have a legitimate excuse for being late.
Avoid using the bathroom too frequently. Students who ask to use the bathroom on a regular basis seem like they do not want to be in class. This is not impressive! Try to use the bathroom during your free time or between classes.

, Students start to receive more responsibility in middle school. This can be challenging for some students at first. Teachers will be impressed if you remain organized and bring all the necessary materials to class.Staying organized can be a challenge. Try keeping a planner to write down all your assignments. Create a labeled folder and notebook for your work in each class.

, Make an effort to ask and answer questions during class. This shows that you are engaged in what is being taught. Teachers spend a lot of time preparing lessons and materials, so they will appreciate your interest in learning.Do not raise your hand without a reason. Remember to have something thoughtful to contribute to the class. Restate what was already said to show that you were really listening.
In a literature class, for example, you might say, “I agree with what Janice said about the metaphor. This theme is also similar to the poem we read last week.”

, Teachers want you to do well in school, but they know that some students will fall short. Students who consistently complete all assignments on time and to the best of their ability are impressive to teachers."
"
Set a clear goal.,
Be persistent in achieving your goal.,
Report signs of progress.,
Assess the outcome.",How to Impress Your Middle School Teachers3," Think about the things you enjoy doing. It can be directly related to your subjects in school or an extracurricular activity. Teachers are impressed when students show positive progress in any area. Choose something you enjoy and set a goal to get better at it by the end of the year.For example, you might really enjoy drawing. Make a goal to become a better artist by the end of the year. You can state that goal to your teachers by saying, “Ms. Cowan, I drew this bird, but I my goal is to draw more realistically by the end of the year.”
Alternatively, you may choose a more behavioral goal. If you know that you talk out of turn, you might make it a goal to speak only when you are called on.

, Practice as much as possible. Remember that you are working at something that you enjoy doing, so you should be fairly willing to practice.The more you practice, the better you will become. Be aware that you will probably face some setbacks. Whether you want to be a great essay writer or learn a new instrument, you may have days where you do not feel that you are advancing. Accept the challenges as a part of the learning experience. Consistently remind yourself that you are working toward something that is special to you.For example, if you want to learn to play a difficult song on the piano, you will have to work hard to get it right. Look at your schedule and find the best days and times to practice the song. Expose yourself to any information that will help you progress. Try watching instructional videos, seeking advice from a music teacher, or simply listening to the song in your free time.

, If you can, show your teachers any signs of progress. Maybe your goal is academic. If so, ask your teachers to help you evaluate your progress. If your goal is extracurricular, you might simply report how things are going. Your teacher will be impressed with any visible progress that you make toward your goal.For example, you might say, “Hi Ms. Tapia. Guess what? I scored 12 points in the basketball game yesterday-- that’s six more than the last game!”

, By the end of the year, you should be able to see how far you have come. Compare your abilities in the beginning of the year to your abilities in the end of the year.


You might say, for example, “Ms. Alexander, can I show you my drawings? One is from September, and the other I drew last week.”

Get your sleeping back on track.,
Do your homework.,
Go shopping.,
Get mentally and physically prepared.,
Beauty and style.,
Have fun.",How to Have a Smooth Transition Back to School," Gradually set your alarm clock earlier, and your body will get used to the hours it has to sleep. Make sure you get at least 8-10 hours of sleep each night so you can focus and won't be tired all day.


Sleeping earlier will help you go to school with a better attitude.
;
, Did you have summer homework? Maybe a book to read, or some algebra? Is it done? If not, get started! You don't want to start the year already behind on your work.

, If you have a list of supplies, or even if you don't, go get them. Get the basics first, then go for everything else. Remember that better quality supplies towards the top of your price range are better in the long run than cheaper ones that fall apart. Also, if your previous bag got worn out, pick up a new one. Get a good quality one that will hold all your books in a way that won't hurt your back.


While you're out getting supplies is a good time for some new clothes. Make sure they are school appropriate and are comfortable. They don't have to be the latest fashion, just something that suits you.

, Think about your classes. Are you doing AP History? Check some books up out of the library that are relevant to the time period you'll be doing. What about gym? Try jogging around the block every day to get in shape. If you're doing an art class, work on your drawing skills. It's never too soon to be prepared.

, Inner beauty matters, but people won't see it if they aren't impressed by your outer beauty. Chances are, you're a teenager and probably have some form of acne or another. Try some over-the-counter or homemade remedies first, and if that doesn't work, try Proactiv or Murad or another effective acne treatment.


Change up your hair, too. There are so many things you can do to change your hair, like dying it or getting it cut. Even something as simple as straightening or curling it can make a big difference. If you want to dye it, but don't want it to be permanent, try dying it with henna.


, It is school, true, but that doesn't mean it has to be boring. You can meet new friends and join a club, like the speech and debate team or a robotics team. Play your strengths. If you are anaspiring writer, join a creative writing team or the school newspaper staff. With a little creativity, you can make school, dare I say it, fun.

Make sure you know your way around school before the first day if possible, like at an open house or orientation.,
Lay out your clothes the night before.,
Make sure everything is together.,
You need to ditch those first day jitters.,

At school, be confident.,
Make sure your hair isn't greasy or dirty.,
Meet your friends by the entrance, if possible.,
Bags are important.,
Get into the spirit!",How to Have a Great First Day of School (for Girls)," You may have guides, if this is so, just keep your eye on them and don't get distracted. If you can't find your way to class, try to find the reception or ask a teacher or student.;
, Dress Well. It saves about 10 minutes of time. And, if you change your mind, you won't have to start over. Lay out an undershirt, underwear, top, bottom, socks, and shoes. Also anything else, like earrings or a scarf. (Make an alternative outfit, in case you have second thoughts.) About a week before school starts, you should start to see what pieces of clothing look good together. Buy some outfits, but also buy a bunch of plain, dark, light, or ripped jeans. Also buy some plain color t-shirts. They look good with anything! Wait until school starts, to do the bulk of your shopping, to see what is ""in"". If you have a uniform, make sure it's been washed, pressed and hung up. Always wear full school uniform on the first day of school.

, Put this with your school clothes. If you are wearing makeup, lay your supplies out as well. Decide exactly what you'll do in the morning so you'll be prepared. Leave yourself time to get ready, by planning a rough schedule and adding fifteen minutes. Don't get your supplies list until day 1. Buy a notebook and binder for every class, so you only get to get a few things the school-rush day. That way, you won't get stuck with a Hello Kitty notebook or a Barbie binder.

, Look in the mirror, and practice your smile, conversation starters, anything else you may say, and tell yourself you'll have an awesome first day. Use whitening toothpaste. For an extra fresh, clean mouth, rinse with mouthwash, brush your teeth, and rinse with mouthwash again. Pack some mints for your locker also. Keep your head up and smile; confidence is key!

, Also keep a box of ""extras"". Anything extra you'll need, such as a mini brush, lip gloss, and mascara, extra ponytails, clips, feminine things, and a headband. Or, if you are not that worried about all that, use it for extra things you just want to have in case, like ballpoint pens, or anything else.

, In it you should pack gum/mints,), extra pens, pads or tampons, and anything else. Don't over-pack. Only bring the essentials: extra supplies, makeup, and only what you need for the class. So, you have backup, while in style! Tomboy gal? Pack it in a small Puma handbag or a Hollister tote - they don't look as girly, and they are durable.

, Triple check, though you won't need much on Day 1, you still should get everything you can into your locker.

, You can write things you are worried about or things you're excited about - whatever makes you relax better. Write in bold/large letters, I'll Do Great! Keep it under your pillow, or if you don't want someone to find it, throw it away somewhere.

, feel good. If it isn't too late, get a steady sleep schedule started 1-2 weeks before school starts. If it's too late, start as soon as you can! Calm down, and just relax

, Take a quick, 10 minute shower (or take one the night before).

, If it helps you, practice approaching people, asking questions and directions, and your great, beautiful smile! Just remember, don't make your conversations awkward, practice something you would say, not something random!

, Even if you are feeling a bit anxious, convince yourself you're totally relaxed and confident. People won't shove you through the halls; they will help and respect you.

, You always want to feel confident, and you don't want people to say your hair's gross!

, You will feel a lot better if you walk into school with your friends, so you aren't so lost or look like you don't know where to go. This is the best way to start the day. If this is your first day in a completely new neighborhood, and you don't have any friends just yet, then promise yourself you'll make some! When you get used to the new school, especially high school, you shouldn't be afraid to introduce yourself to new people in the classes your usual friends aren't in. Be friendly!

, If you are girly you could choose a fashion bag that is colourful but large. If you are not so girly then choose a sports bag or backpack.

, Starting from scratch is always hard. Make lots of friends, join a few clubs here and there, get to know teachers. It's going to be a great year so be sure to start it off right!

Keep but don’t retreat to old friends.",How to Handle Being the New Kid at School," Walk with your head held high and don't slouch. If you look confident, everyone will think you're confident. That's why first impressions are so important. Just remember not to be overly confident, you don't want to come across as rude or self absorbed.;
, This way you'll know where everything is. You also won't be embarrassed because you do not know where anything is.

, This way you will be able to get to the lunch room early and won't have to face the embarrassment of having nowhere to sit.

, That way you will meet some friends that have the same interests as you. They may not go to the same school, but they're still friends, right?

, They will be glad that you can speak for yourself and will respect you for that. It may be hard for you but you do not have to do it in the middle of class!

, Wear your best outfit (not fancy), and do your hair nice and neat. Something like a plain shirt and jeans is fine. Remember, first impressions are important.

, This is another first impression thing. People will respect you for being confident.

, If they asked you where you lived, don't lie, tell them the truth. Don't tell them you live at that White House.

, You'll make a friend you sit next to every day.

, Smiling is one of the quickest ways of making people like you. It makes you seem more friendly.

, For at least the first day, you’re exotic. Especially in a school where there isn’t much coming and going, you’re someone special. Yes, it’s true you left what is familiar. But the new place is also a new opportunity. Nobody knows who you are, who you hung out with, or what to expect from you. If you didn’t quite like who you are or the reputation you had, you have a chance to start over. If you did like it, you can take that confidence with you and make a big splash.

, If at all possible, visit the school before school starts. It’s hard enough to start over without also getting lost all the time. Ask your folks to arrange a tour. Figure out where the principal’s office is and how to get to the library. Ask for a map of the layout of the school. No time for this? Well, asking for directions is one way to begin to get to know people.

, Get on the Internet and find out about the school. There’s probably a website. If there isn’t one for the school, look for the town’s site. You can find out about sports teams and events. You can learn what clubs are active and how the teams are doing. You can even check out what is usually served for lunch.

, When you’re lonely, it’s tempting to grab onto whoever grabs you. But you want to take the time to look things over and figure out who’s who. As you know, as soon as you start hanging with a particular group, it will be hard to change your mind.

, For most teens, clothes are code for who you are. Wear a clean, neat, but kind of neutral outfit the first day. Get up in time to shower and do your hair. Jeans are generally fine as long as they’re clean and not flashy. Presenting yourself neutrally the first few days gives you time to figure out the informal rules for dress among the students. Once you’ve got it down, you can dress to fit in with the group you want to accept you.

, Pack a lunch so you don’t have to stand in line wondering whether to accept someone’s invitation to join their table or, worse, to have to walk the long mile in front of everyone to an empty table. Confidently sit on the edge and watch for a few days. Sit in a way that broadcasts confidence. You’re not a reject. You’re taking the time to think about who you’ll choose to be with.

, First impressions do matter and you want to make a good one. Try to get to classes a bit early or to stay a few minutes after class to introduce yourself and to tell them where you’re from. A few minutes of politeness will get things off on the right foot.

, A fast way to get to know some people is to join a team, a club, the band, a service organization, or student activities. People who share the same interests are likely your kind of people. Even if you don’t make real friends at first, you’ll learn some people’s names and you’ll have a few people to say hi to in the halls.

, Once you’ve got an idea who you want to meet, it’s up to you. Take a deep breath, pull up your big boy or big girl pants and start introducing yourself. Set a goal of meeting at least one new person a day. Say hello to the person who sits next to you in English class. Strike up a conversation with the person who has the locker next to yours. Remember – people like to talk about themselves. Think of a couple of questions you can ask each person and the conversation will take off almost by itself.

, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, texting, email and even the phone can let you stay in touch with old friends. That’s all good. But it can also be quicksand. If you let yourself spend hours and hours communicating with old friends, you’ll make it less likely that you’ll find new ones. By staying so connected to people who live hours away, you might keep yourself lonely in your own backyard.

"
Get yourself together a week before school.,
Prepare early.,
Get some more clothing items.,
Decide on your transportation in advance.,
Plan out your outfit a few days before school starts.,
Be prepared for the various classes you have.",How to Have a Great First Day of School1," Realize that it's probably best to wake up a bit earlier now and hit the haystack before midnight. Know that school is around the corner, and that it's time to get prepared.;
, It would not be great to go school supply shopping the night before the first day. A few weeks before school starts, make a list of what you need for school.


If you get a supply list in the mail, follow it. If you don't, write out what you think you need. (Note: you may have to return to the store to get a few more items after school has already started). Set a budget, and head off to the store. This is more fun with a friend.






Some ideas are binders, notebooks, pencils, pens, erasers, correction tape, paper clips, lined paper, pencil crayons, highlighters, etc. If you can, reuse some things you still have from the previous school year. It is best to start fresh with new supplies.



, Again, make a list of what you want/need. It's also more fun to go shopping with a friend, sibling or another family member.


A list of what you might need includes the following:






At least 2 pairs of new jeans (one dark wash and one light wash is probably a good way to start)
2 pairs of new leggings (black is an essential in any girl's wardrobe)
2 pairs of sweatpants, new shoes are essential (you should get running shoes for gym; some good brands include Nike, Adidas, Puma, etc.)


You may also want some new sandals/flip flops if it's warm where you live or if it's getting chilly, you may want combat boots or Ugg boots. Toms, Converse, Vans and Keds are also good choices).



Try having 1 pair of gym shoes, and 3 good pairs of shoes you can wear to school. If you already have these shoes, you probably don't need to purchase more.


You should make sure you have enough undergarments that fit well, as well as tank tops. You should get a few new shirts, like flannels, t-shirts, long-sleeve shirts as well as hoodies and sweaters. For pants, shirts, sweaters and undergarments, try stores like American Eagle, Hollister, Abercrombie, VS Pink, Macy's, Brandy Melville, Topshop, etc.


You may also need smaller items, like new hair accessories (bobby pins, hair elastics, headbands, etc.), makeup (small makeup bag for your backpack, mascara, lip balm, concealer, etc.) and more.
You may also need a new backpack. Some prefer backpacks, and others tote bags. Get one that's big enough to fit all of your stuff, but not too large.
You may also need a new gym bag, which you should fill with your gym uniform/clothes, deodorant, a small body spray, extra socks, running shoes, a water bottle, and etc. You probably don't need to bring this on the first day, unless specified by your school. You may also need a lunch bag if you bring your own lunch.

, You may be taking the bus, carpooling, riding in the car or biking/walking.

, Make sure it represents your personality and that it looks exactly the way you like it.


Try wearing skinny jeans and a cute top with flip flops, sandals, Converse, Keds, Vans or Uggs, depending on the weather. If it's warm enough, you can wear cute denim shorts, as long as they pass your school's dress code. If it's cool out, put a cute cardigan over your shirt.







, Get a copy of your class' timetable so you know what lessons you are having, then you will know what equipment you will need. If you are not sure, ask the teacher of that lesson for what you are doing and what you will need. They will not think you weird, they will be delighted to tell you!

If you want, you may now perfect your clear face using makeup.,

If you'd like, tone your body.,
Brush your teeth every night and every morning.,
Every two days or so, you might want to shave your legs and/or armpits.,
Consider exploring new styles.",How to Improve Yourself Over the Summer," Most people actually prefer a more natural (and less orange) pigment.;
, You don't have to paint them every day, but keep them clean and even. Keep toenails well-groomed and painted as well.

, Even if your skin is acne-free, cleanse with a gel cleanser each night. Follow with a moisturizer and maybe an acne gel. If you have severe acne, please go to a dermatologist! The best drugstore acne soap brands to use are Neutrogena and Clean&Clear.

, If you have perfect or nearly-perfect clear skin, foundation will make you break out so don't use it. Just pat on a good concealer, and top with sheer powder foundation to create a blank canvas to work on. Now, apply neutral eyeshadow to your lids and a highlighting shade on you browbone. Swipe on a coat of mascara, and if you want to blend some eyeliner onto eyes. Swipe on a coat of clear gloss, and you have that 'I'm naturally pretty' look.

, Try layers with side bangs or just a razor-cut layered trim. You can add highlights, but get them pretty thin so they look as natural as possible.

, You will look and feel fantastic!

, Use mouthwash AND floss each morning and night. You can also use Crest Whitestrips or Aquafresh White Trays.

, If your hair isn't visible, don't start shaving yet. You can also pluck any stray eyebrow hairs. If you want to, you can shave or wax your arms, too. That's just a personal preference, though, so it's up to you. Warning: If you have removed body hair, it may appear thicker/darker as it grows back. It will then take a while to go back to normal, so make sure you would be committed to regular plucking/shaving/waxing.

, There may be a style you never even thought of that you would love! Don't be afraid to try something alternative, as long as it suits you.

You don’t want to feel like you can’t participate in class or like you’re already on your teacher’s bad side because you’ve forgotten to bring what you need. Though it varies school by school, make sure you have a notebook or binder for each class, writing utensils, or anything else you may need. If your school has given you a list, then you’re in luck; if not, be prepared to get more information on the first day.


Make sure you have a sturdy, durable backpack, too. You’ll be getting your textbooks on the first day and may need to take some home to do homework.
Let’s be real: on the first day of school, it’s unlikely that you’ll do more in any class than meet the other kids, do roll call, go through the syllabus, and be told what school supplies to bring. Still, if your teachers or school administrators have told you what you need to bring in advance and are sticklers about it, then you need to be prepared.;
, Ah, the first day of school outfit. It’s never easy to pick one, and it’s likely to be something that you remember for years to come. Fortunately, no one else will really remember what you’re wearing because they’ll be too focused on their own “first day of school” outfit. That said, you should make sure you pick something that is flattering, well-fitting, and that leaves an impression without standing out so much that you’ll regret wearing it in the months to come. The most important thing is that you have it picked out so you don’t stress out in the morning about finding the perfect outfit!


Take the weather into account, too. In a lot of places, the first day of school tends to be unbearably hot. You may want to wear a pair of cute new jeans, but if it’s 90 degrees out, you’ll be too sweaty to enjoy them. Make sure you have a lighter backup in mind if you wake up to a muggy day.
A lot of girls like to talk to their friends. You may feel better about wearing a dress if your friends are, too. That said, be okay with doing your own thing!
Also, make sure you know your school’s dress code in advance. You don’t want to wear something that’s too short or too skimpy and then have to be forced to change into your gym clothes.

, Try to get to know as much as you can about your school in advance so you feel more in control on that first day. Go on your school's website and look around. You'll probably be using it a lot this year, so get a feel for where stuff is. Read any handbooks or other important information offered. Talk to someone older than you who went to your school. Ask them questions about tips for getting around, how to act around certain teachers, or where to sit in the cafeteria.


Face it: there are going to be some curve balls no matter what. That said, trying to get as much information as you can will make you feel more at ease.
If you have your schedule already, try to talk to any older students who have experience with the teachers you have so they’ll know what to expect.

, Most schools have orientations, but every school is different - some schools might just give a tour, while other schools might also give you a bunch of stuff, like a map, schedule, library card, and PE uniform. Take the opportunity to walk around your new school, if you can. Following your schedule and your map, walk to each of your classrooms and your locker, if you’ve been assigned one, so you know where things are.


It’s likely that your orientation will include students funneling in from other elementary schools, so this can be a chance to get a leg up and to meet new people. Be friendly and introduce yourself. People will be shy and will be excited to meet someone new. Knowing more people in advance can help you have a better time on that first day. Don't forget to remember their names.
You may also get to meet or see some of your teachers or your school principal, and you’ll feel better knowing what to expect.
A lot of people also think their middle school feels impossibly huge compared to their elementary school. Going there in advance before your first day will make it feel less intimidating.

, If you’re lucky enough to have a map of your school and to know where all of your classes will be and when, and if you already know where your locker is, then you may be able to create a passing routine in advance. This can help you not be late to class and to know when is the best time to go to your locker.


Don't go to your locker between every class because you'll end up running all over the school. Plan to go to it when you’re closest. If you need to carry a few classes worth of books at a time, that's okay. Just be sure you have what you need, when you need it.

, Lay out all of your notebooks, folders and other supplies. On the inside cover of your notebooks and folders, near the top, write in the subject you're using it for. If possible, color-coordinate your subjects — for example, math can be blue, English can be pink, and science can be zebra print! For any binders, label the side with its subject and decorate the front with pictures to make you smile. Having your stuff organized will make for a less overwhelming first day.


You can take notes on sheets of loose-leaf, lined paper and then store them in a binder by subject, or just use a notebook — it all depends on what your teacher prefers. If you use a notebook, you can either use a multi-subject notebook or a separate small notebook for each subject.
Put everything in your backpack. Make sure you put all your pencils, pens, erasers and such in a pencil case so that they're all together and you won't have to dig around for them.
Find a safe spot to put your student ID, library card, etc. Clean off your desk or another area of your room to do your homework on. Make sure that there is nothing distracting around it, as you don't want your homework to take longer than needed. Get a calendar and a bulletin board and hang it there.
If you want, get a locker organizer to bring to school, which may include a mirror, magnets, pencil holders and small shelves (although there may already be shelves in your locker). Decide where everything will go before school starts; a messy locker will make you late and get you in trouble.

, Talk to your friends before school starts and find out if you can go to school together. Whether you're riding the bus, walking, or something else, you won't have to show up all by yourself, as that can be intimidating sometimes and if you don't know where to go, you can help each other. You’ll feel less alone if you have your favorite friends by your side.


That said, if you’re new to the school district or don’t have many friends, don’t worry! You’re not alone and you’ll quickly make some friends of your own if you have a positive attitude.

, Though you may find it nearly impossible to go to sleep the night before middle school, you can do some things to make it feel more doable. A couple of weeks or so before school starts, start getting yourself on a school schedule. Go to bed earlier than usual and gradually wake up earlier until you reach the time you will actually need to wake up at for school. Ease yourself into that schedule.


Avoid soda or other caffeinated or sugary drinks the day before school. You don’t want to keep yourself up later than necessary.

, The night before your first day of school (or any day of school, for that matter), lay out your clothes for the next day. Wear something nice and comfortable; something that makes you feel confident. Make sure you put out socks, shoes, accessories and anything else you plan to wear. Having everything in its place before the big day can make that first morning seem a lot more relaxing.


Make a lunch, if you’re bringing one, or make sure you have lunch money in your bag, if you’re buying one.
Plan how you will do your hair, if you like to do something special with it (but don't go overboard). You don’t want to have to worry about this on the first day.
Bring your ID card if you have one, your class schedule, your phone, and anything else you’ll need to make it through the day.

, Give yourself at least fifteen extra minutes to make sure you have time to get your act together. The first day can already be a little bit stressful, and you’ll feel more relaxed if you’re not running around. This extra time will help you perfect your look, have enough time to eat breakfast, to have a nice shower, and do anything else you need to do to start that first day off on the right foot.


It's a good idea to pack your bag the night before school, to make sure you have all the supplies you need. You'll be able to save time in the morning so you won't be rushed.

, You should know where your first class, or your homeroom is before you walk into the halls of your middle school. If you’re lost, however, just ask a teacher, administrator, or even an older student for help. It’s important to know where you’re headed so you don’t wander around aimlessly or miss out on something important. It’s likely you’ll go to homeroom first, where you’ll meet your homeroom teacher and will get important information about your day.


Though having a plan is important, you also don’t have to worry if things don’t go as planned. Even the beginning of your first day of middle school can throw you some surprises, and that won’t be a bad thing.

, Though you may be feeling shy, you should do the best you can to be as nice and friendly to the new students in your classes as you can. Introduce yourself, ask them about themselves, and talk about what you think of middle school, so far. Smile and wave at people, and make them feel welcome in your presence. Don’t be intimidated by people who seem too cool or too stuck up, either. Just make an effort to be approachable and easygoing.


People will be more receptive to new friendships at the beginning of the year, before too many cliques form. The sooner you talk to new people, the more likely you’ll be to connect for real.
If you see a cute guy or girl, don’t be afraid to say hi. People like confidence, and you don’t have to be shy about talking to people.

, Though you may not think it’s cool to care, if you want to get through middle school and start off on the right foot, it’s far better to listen to your teachers, to participate when they ask questions, to take notes, and to avoid any distractions than to act like a know-it-all or like you couldn’t care less. Make an effort to be a good student and to make the most of each class you take. If you care about the material, you’ll have more fun in the process than you would if you were just sulking and waiting for the bell to ring.


Though there may not be too many opportunities to participate on the first day, you should do the best you can to show that you care, even if you just ask a question about the syllabus.

, Make sure you show up to class on time and that you make a good impression right away. You may accidentally make a bad first impression by laughing too much or chattering with your friends even if you’re normally a good student. Unfortunately, first impressions are notoriously hard to break, so try to put your best foot forward when you step into the classroom.


You don’t have to suck up to your teachers, either. Just pay attention and act like you really care and you’ll be on your way.

, Each middle school is different. You should get a sense of how the seating in your cafeteria works. If you can choose a new seat every day, try to plan to meet up with your friends in advance so you can sit together. If you have to choose the same table for the entire year, see if you can get together a group of people to make it work. If you don’t know many people in your new school yet, then don’t worry. Just be friendly, find some people who look nice, and ask if you can sit next to them.


If you can, you should try to get to the cafeteria as early as you can. That way, you’ll be more likely to find your friends or to find a place to sit.

, If you want to make the most of your first day, then you should try to get through it with a big smile on your face. Don’t complain to your friends, criticize your teachers, or dread every one of your classes. Instead, try to approach everything with a “can do” attitude and don’t ever feel like people will never give you a chance. If you smile, expect only the best, and try to stick to optimistic topics, you’ll be having a much better day.


Besides, people are drawn to positive people; the more upbeat you are, the easier it will be for you to make new friends.
Don’t compare yourself to other people. You may feel like you’re not as good-looking or as well-dressed as some of the people in your school, but this kind of thinking is pointless and will only get you down. Remember that you have a lot to offer, too, and the well-dressed girl in your French class may have her own set of problems.

, Unfortunately, not every person is at his best in middle school. It’s easy to fall into cliques, to gossip, or just to judge other people you don’t really know. However, if you want to make it through your first day in a good mood, you should avoid judging anyone before you get to know him or her or even being a part of any silly gossip. You wouldn’t want people who barely know you to gossip about you, would you?


You don’t know who your best friends will be yet, and you don’t want to find yourself making fun of someone who could have been your best friend if you had only given her a chance.

, Now that your day is wrapping up, it’s time to pack up your school bag with any of the books or homework you need to take home. It’s likely that you won’t have very much packing to do, but you should make sure to get everything you need so you’re not at a loss when you get home. Make sure you give yourself enough time at the end of the day to do this properly. You can even make a checklist toward the end of the day so you can pack up your things more efficiently.


If you take the bus home and don’t want to be late, you can get into the habit of packing up your bag in your locker when you have some time between classes so you don’t have to do it all in the few minutes before the bus leaves.

, Whether you have some new clubs or sports organizations to go to or whether you’re taking the bus straight home, phew! You’ll be surprised by how tired you may feel once all the adrenalin wears off. You’ll find yourself feeling sleepy, and coming down from a long day filled with many surprises. Go home and take a short nap to recover!


That said, don’t sleep for too long, or you’ll have trouble resting for your second day of middle school.

, Though your first day of school went better than you could have imagined, there are always things you can improve for the next day. Maybe you wore super uncomfortable shoes and want to plan for a better outfit the next day. Maybe your backpack wasn’t big enough to hold all of your books. Maybe you forgot some essential school supplies or wished you had woken up earlier. Whatever minor thing went wrong, you can plan to make it better the next day so you can continue to enjoy your new school.


The most important thing is to get some rest and have a positive attitude. The less pressure you put on yourself, the more likely you’ll be to have a great time.

Make a list of the supplies you'll need.,
Choose a quiet time for back-to-school shopping.,
Get your school schedule.,
Consider what accommodations you might need.,
Decide how much information about your disability(ies) you want your teachers or professors to know.,
Decide how to tell your teacher(s) that you are disabled/autistic.,
Watch your anxiety levels.",How to Go Back to School if You're Autistic1," Suggested school supply lists can be found online. Your school or local store may also hand them out or email them. Next, go through your school supplies at home, and see if you already have some items. You will need to go shopping for the remaining ones.


It can be helpful to store all your unused or reusable school supplies in a box.;
, Try the early morning or late evening, when the store might be less crowded. Weekdays, when most adults are at work, may also be quieter. This will help you avoid sensory overload in the store.


It can be tempting to pick out new types of everything: new stapler, new erasers, new rubber bands, new pencil grips. To save money, ask yourself if you are actually going to use this, and if you have enough at home.

, You may have it already, or you might have to wait until shortly before school starts.


If you get your schedule before school starts, see if you can visit the school before classes begin. That way you can find each room you'll be going to. You probably won't be able to go in, but you can see where it is.

, Think about what you got last year (if anything), and try researching possibilities online. If you can think of something that would lift a burden from your shoulders, bring it up.


There are lists of potential accommodations online for autism and other disabilities (anxiety, dyslexia, etc.).
If you have an IEP from previous years, ask to see a copy. What goals might you have for yourself? Are there any goals you want changed?

, If you're receiving accommodations, then they will know that you are disabled. Due to negative stereotypes about autism, some autistic people prefer not to share the name of their disability. Others like to be more clear. Choose what you feel most comfortable with. Your options are...


Say that you are autistic.
Say that you have a developmental disability that causes some special needs and behavior differences (e.g. stimming in class)
Say that you have a disability
Say nothing
Remember, you can always choose to share more at a later point if it becomes necessary. However, if you will or might need accommodations, it's best to disclose that you are disabled early on, so the teacher is not surprised.

, Generating spontaneous speech can be difficult for some people, so you may find it easier to write an email or hand them a note. Talking after class is also a possibility, if you have enough passing time and feel comfortable doing so.


Deciding how you will handle this beforehand can make it easier when the time comes.
You may find it helpful to share with your teachers some articles about autism, such as what autism is or how to teach autistic students. Feel free to search wikiHow for articles that could help.

, Change can be stressful, especially for autistic people. This is also crucial if you have an anxiety disorder. If you notice yourself getting stressed, use coping mechanisms (like stimming) and tell someone how you feel.


If you envision a horrible scenario in your head, pause. Ask yourself: how likely is it that this will actually happen? Worst-case scenarios usually do not happen. Remind yourself this.

The night before your first day, lay out all your clothes neatly.,Go to sleep nice and early

",How to Have the Perfect First Day at Secondary School1," Prepare early, and purchase all your equipment a couple of weeks before school starts. Go with a mum, sister or friend, to give you inspiration if your unsure of what to get. Most schools will give you a list – if so, make sure you get every thing on it. Otherwise, ask someone whom goes to the school for advise.If you know no one older who goes to your new school, and you have no list, start with these basic supplies – remember, if you don’t have everything on your first day, it probably won't is a big deal. Some stuff you might want to get:


A strong, durable pencil case, clearly named, big enough to hold your stuff and that stands out from the crowd.
Three HB pencils, a rubber and a sharpener
A set of coloured pencils
A ruler, a pair of compasses and a geometry set
A fountain pen with washable blue/black ink cartridges (whichever your teacher prefers – if your not sure, get a few of both)
Finally, a scientific calculator.;
,  Check that it is named, and, if you are getting a second hand one, make sure that it is clean and ironed. A dirty, messy uniform will leave a bad impression on your teacher, and this is the last thing you need. Also, if you need to get a P.E bag, lacrosse stick, shin pads, a mouth guard etc. make sure you get that too. In the case of mouth guards, try to get it professionally fitted, to ensure your safety. Some schools ask that you get predominantly white trainers – make sure you stick to the color code.

, Go on your schools website and look around. It will contain useful information, and you will probably be using it a lot this year so make sure you know where stuff is. Also read any handbooks or starter packs offered.

, Put out all your pencils, books and binders and put everything in one backpack or shoulder bag (this should be strong, durable, and weatherproof). Make sure you know where stuff is, and that you have a suitable place for things like a student ID, if your school gives you one. You also may like to keep a bag of hair ties (for girls) and a small hairbrush, in case of an emergency.


If you want, get a small box of extra supplies, including cartridges, and extra pen, or some rubbers, in case you lose your current ones.
Find a way to stay on top of homework, as if you don’t, it will quickly become overwhelming and stressful. Clear some space on your desk, and devote a shelf to your schoolbooks, for when you not using them. Another idea is to get a calendar or bulletin board, so you can transfer any important events you have to it, such as exams. Most schools provide you with a homework planner/agenda, but you can usually buy them cheaply at a stationary shop if not. Make sure you write EVERYTHING down in it – exams, homework, its due dates etc. Don’t just write it down on a scrap of paper, or phone a friend later. It won’t work.

, A few weeks before school, start going to bed earlier, and waking up at the time you actually need to, when you start school. Ease yourself into the schedule – and once you’ve started, don’t waste all your hard work by going to bed at 2am.

, Make sure you lay out your socks, shoes and any other accessories you are planning to wear (if your school allows it)


Make a lunch if you are bringing one, or make sure you have money, if you are buying one. Take a shower, so you won’t have to do so in the morning. Check once more that everything is in your bag. Plan how you are going to do your hair. That way, you won’t stand in front of the mirror the next morning, wondering about what to do with your hair.

Yogurt with muesli
A bowl of fruit

, Brush your teeth well and floss only if needed. If possible, save flossing for night (and maybe even rinse with a mouthwash before bed). Brush and style your hair, but don't overdo it. Again, don't wear a beautiful bun with little curls if you're going to wear a ponytail every other day of the year. If you're style isn't working and you've tried more than twice, skip it. For now stick with a bun, a ponytail, or a simpler version of what you were trying to do.

, Always try to leave early so that you have plenty of time.

, At school try to make friends as quickly as possible. That way you will feel more secure. Try complimenting someone on their handwriting or something. Usually a conversation will start from there. If someone compliments you, remember to smile, say thank you, and try to return the favour.

, If your teacher asks a question about you don’t be shy, she and your classmates are more likely to take an interest if they know something about you. Always write neatly in your books and use a ruler to underline things.

, She will not be pleased if you lose or forget your homework on the first day. Use your homework planner to write down all of your assignments as soon as you get them. Also write down their due dates, as well as tests. That way everything is in one place. If you have a large calendar on your wall at home, transfer items from there to your planner on the weekend. Go to your locker when you planned to.

, Do not do it in front of the television. Then take a shower, pack your bag, making sure all your homework in it, read or watch T.V, and go to sleep at the time you’ve planned.

Learn the basics of organizing.,
Plan.,
Start your schedule.,
Make sure everything is balanced, and don't forget to spend time on different things like studying- not 'homework studying', but 'revision studying'- exercise, relaxation, social life and whatever else you want to do.,
Read the list of requirements your school might have provided you with.,
Organize your locker.,
Do the same for your folder/binder too.,

So we're not actually going to organize time, we're trying to organize ourselves. And organizing ourselves takes a lot of time, so planning is one of the best ways to tough it out.;
, Definitely easier said than done. So firstly, (if you don't have it already) get a planner. They're really good tools to help you organize.

, You want to be able to balance work and fun. For a start, think of what you want to do or have to do after school. Most of us think about completing homework, but make sure you make some time for yourself too. You can surf the web for examples of different schedules. Once you've got a rough idea of it you'll find it easier to start yours.

, Below are a few examples of tips on the basic stuff you need to focus on to maintain a happy lifestyle.

, If they didn't, you'll have to make a list of exactly what you need. You can add any extra stuff you want, like sticky notes, tabs, erasers for pens, etc., if they're not listed already. Try not to go overboard and buy things which you don't need or stuff which you won’t use at all.

, Use dividers to separate sections for different things which you want to keep. Be free to customize it however you want, but keep it simple yet fun and creative.



Top Tip: Magnetic hooks are really useful too. Rather than rolling up clothes and stuffing them straight into your locker, you can hang them up on the hooks. Many students find these really handy as they don't consume space, leaving more room for other things in your locker.

Use subject dividers to separate different sections for different subjects. You can also use punch pockets for your binder. Punch pockets can help you store smaller notes or small documents from each class. Try to get one pocket per subject.

Top Tip: Color-coordinating is also a great way to organize. Try to choose one color for each subject. For example, let's say you choose yellow for Maths. So for Maths, use a yellow subject divider, a yellow side rim for the punch pocket, yellow tabs, and so on. You can even use a yellow highlighter to highlight notes for Maths!

, Don't ever postpone work. If you're really free, instead of wasting your time talking over the phone, work on that assignment you haven't completed yet. Whenever you decide to postpone work, you're just building it up some more. And if you rush to complete lots of work the night before the deadline, you end up


losing sleep,
getting stressed up,
being unable to produce quality work, and
if you ask your folks to help you out, you're gonna get nagged at

, They might be able to evaluate whether your tuition classes are really worth your time, or whether your homework is too much for you to handle.



Top Tip: A good idea of how long you should take to complete your homework is to add 10 minutes for each grade. Let's say, if you're in 5th grade, homework should take about 50 minutes daily to complete, and when you go to 6th grade, it'll be one hour daily.
Sometimes you might take a bit longer to complete your homework, depending on your writing speed, available resources to research things, the environment, or maybe you just take some time to do something. So it would be normal if you take an extra half hour to finish your homework. But if your time exceeds an extra 90 minutes, then better get your parents to talk to your teachers. Life shouldn't be just about homework.

, This place should be free from distractions, and should suit your study style well. Choose a table which has multiple drawers, and is an appropriate size. A few basic study tools that you need to have are:


a study lamp
access to a laptop/computer with internet connection

bookcases or file holders
stationery
pencil holder/case
art materials
a paper wastebasket
a cork board


, Keep these areas neat and tidy, as they are your personal areas. When important places like these are kept messy and loitered, they tend to have negative effects on your overall health, like stress. Besides, you don't want to suffer the whole night looking for that form you have pass up the next day, would you?


If you have a really tight schedule and don't have enough time to do a through clean-up, try breaking it up into smaller acts to do each week. But if you decide to do this, then it might take much, much longer than you thought it would. The best thing to do is, before you finally break from tension, forget about your homework (for a while), lock your room door, and start to tackle your mess. A good half hour is enough for a nice clean up.And once you're done, it'll feel really good that you've finally done it.

, If you feel that your energy has been sapped away from you and you're tired to the bone, a well-earned rest is just what you need. Apart from a good 8-hour rest at night, you should try a 30-minute nap during the day. Don't oversleep though-a short nap, even though it's less than 30 minutes, would give your body a good energy refuel.

, The only reason that you feel tired is that you're not exercising. The more you exercise, the more your body becomes refreshed. Exercise also helps you to think more clearly, improve your immune system, make you feel active, improve sleep, and even clear your skin!


You can even work out with your friends for motivation. Major boost!

, It takes time, but you would feel really good about yourself once you start to take good care of your the skin you're in.

, Being clean and neat means good body hygiene. Every girl needs deodorant. Try one that has a mild smell.



Top Tip: Choose a deodorant which says that it is antiperspirant. Normal deodorant just makes the sweat smell less prominent, but the antiperspirant ones blocks sweat all at once.
It's ok if normal deodorant (including the antiperspirant ones) don’t work for you. Sometimes some girls just need a stronger prescription. Visit a dermatologist to help you out with this.

, You want to be squeaky clean and smell good and fresh, so use a shower gel that smells like it. Always take a bath before school. This will have you clean and fresh for school in the mornings.



Top Tip: Choose a soap that has a great scent which uplifts your mood. Scents like eucalyptus can make you feel energized in a snap. Fruity scents are also refreshing.
If you want something more natural, go for ""floral"" smelling soaps. They're really calming and are a girly staple.

, Use a really good toothpaste. Try the ones with breath strips and stain removers. Also, floss your teeth after you eat. Don't eat anything too sticky, gooey or has a high content of sugars, since this is bad for your teeth and gums.



Top Tip: Once a week, dab your toothbrush into baking soda, lightly brush your teeth, and rinse. This really helps to polish teeth giving you stainless pearly whites for a Hollywood style smile! Continue doing this for four weeks for the best results.

, When you want to be clean and neat, you have to have good hair. Think of a movie star's hair. Not only is it shiny, it has a healthy glow to it too. Shampoo your hair once every two days, (not daily, since this can strip off oils that give hair its natural shine) and don't forget conditioner. Choose ones that suit your hair type.



Top Tip: Indulge yourself-or to be more appropriate, your hair-every once in a while. Treat your locks with an intensive treatment once a week, or according to the instructions on the type of treatment you choose to use. What type of treatment you choose is totally up to you, but just make sure that it’s tailored specifically for your needs.

, They're much more effective at battling out nasty germs from your hands, keeping them much more cleaner and hygienic.

,, Although your friends might not care, teachers do. They always notice these kinda things. Remember, it's always the small things that makes a big impact. So, always try to make sure that your clothes are crisp and clean for school!


If you want your ironing job to be much less of a chore, try popping your clothes into a clean plastic bag and sprinkling the whole thing with a bit of water. Then tie the bag and wet the outside of the bag. Put the bag in the freezer for about two hours, then remove the clothes and start ironing them. This makes the wrinkles on the clothes much quicker to iron out.

, But don’t always use them on a daily basis. Chemical overload causes serious damage to your hair.

, Also make sure that all bands that you use are fabric-coated ones, not rubber bands. Rubber bands can split your hair, unlike the fabric bands.

, Find one which doesn't feel too heavy or greasy.


Before bed, slather on moisturizing lotion on your feet and cover them with socks. This works to seal and lock in moisture, and is especially great if you sleep in a heated room.

Top Tip: If you want to stop your lips from chapping, rub them with lots of petroleum jelly, or better known by it's brand name, Vaseline, before hitting the sack. When you wake up the next morning, slowly rub your lips with a soft, damp cloth to slough off dead skin cells.

Get in some back to school shopping.,
Repurpose your wardrobe.,
Find a new style.",How to Go Back to School1," Create a budget and a list before diving into a shopping spree. Use social media or just ask your friends if they want to have a clothing swap if your budget is tight. You don’t have to get expensive pieces like jackets or designer tops. Focus on smaller accessories that make it easier to switch up your look.If you’re lucky to have your birthday fall close to the start of school, ask for gift cards or make a wishlist of clothes you’d like so your family and friends know exactly what to get you.Think about the main outfits you’d need throughout the school year. Do you need gym clothes? Should you get a new winter coat?;
, Look through your closet and see if you can find new ways to wear your clothing. You could layer older pieces with something new to create an entirely new outfit. For example, if you have a favourite pair of shorts you could still wear it in the fall if you layer it with a sweater and tights.


You could also wear a summer dress with leggings, a cardigan, and boots.If you’re a guy, wear your favourite short sleeve shirt under a sweater so that the collar gives you the right touch of flair.

, Style can go beyond a wardrobe change. The start or school gives you an opportunity to reinvent your look. Rather than change your wardrobe, try changing your hair colour or style. You can also change your makeup and nail color. Make a statement with bold colours.Find inspiration from celebrities or look on social media sites if you don’t know where to start. You can also mimic the look of an older student or family member that you admire.
Pinterest is a great site to search for style as it allows you to save images and follow influencers.Whether you’re just getting a trim or going for a completely different hair style, make sure you find a hairstylist that you trust. Don’t be afraid to ask them questions about what look suits the shape of your face and texture of your hair.
You do not have to trim anything off your hair if you learn how to create different styles. For example, learn different braids or style your bangs.Research or ask a stylist which hair products work best for your hair. For example, gel is great for hold but gives you a wet look.

Keep food and liquid in separate compartments and containers to make sure they stay fresh and protected.

, Go over what you can still use from the year before and make a list of the essentials. Check with your teachers, older students, or online for tips on specific brands that may be worth their price.

Create your list based on what makes your life easier. Just because something looks good, doesn’t mean that it’s worth the price. For example, a binder with your favourite band on it may be twice the cost of a waterproof binder that has extra compartments for your pens.

, Whether you download an app or use a physical scheduler, learn how to follow a scheduler so that you don’t miss any important deadlines. Staying ahead of projects, presentations, and exams lets you balance your school work with your social activities.Planners and schedulers give a quick snapshot of your schoolwork.

Your new schedule may be a shock to your system so don’t underestimate how tired your body will be as you change from easy late nights to early morning class. Sleep early during school nights because you don’t want to be grumpy and lackadaisical in class. If you need to take a nap, limit it to 90 minutes at most to make sure you’re able to do your homework and still fall asleep at a decent hour.

, The first couple of weeks back can be very hectic as you try to settle in to your classes and extracurricular activities. Prepare your lunches, outfits, school bag the night before. Use the weekend to map out your week., You may put a lot of pressure on yourself to do well in your studies. Having a strong support system and an outlet for stress can help you get through the school year. Check in with friends and family to let them know how your transition back to school is going. If there is anything causing your stress, they may be able to provide help or at least someone you can vent to., It may be easy to think that transitioning back to school will come within time but you have to understand that only you can can make a smooth transition. Continuing to stay up late or follow your holiday schedule will make it more difficult to transition back to school. Your friends may have easier schedules or may not have as many responsibilities as you do. Let them know that you have to limit your time with them now that school has started.

, Food plays a major role in how much energy you have during the day. Stay away from junk food and replace them with fruit and vegetables. Keep your mind and body healthy to get yourself through what can be a stressful transition., The transition may be more difficult than you anticipated. It’s okay to get a low grade on your first assignment or find it difficult to make new friends. Ask yourself what you can do differently to assure that you won’t repeat it. Everything is school can be a learning experience especially failure., Teachers know that this is a difficult time of year and understand that you are not the only one going through the transition. Teachers can not only help you develop effective study habits and work habits but they can also help you if you’re finding it difficult to make friends.

, Your school may have changed a few small things or you may be in a new school completely. Know the rules so that you don’t find yourself in trouble for small infractions. For example, there may be rules about using a mobile phone or the length of your skirt so make sure to check., Make sure to enjoy the remainder of your holiday.

Know what you need.,
Purchase a binder and/or folders.,
Buy a backpack.,
Buy your other supplies.,
Get new shoes.,
Buy clothes.,
Try not to buy clothes that are tight or small on you, or quite big on you, as you may gain or lose weight during the year.",How to Go Back to School Shopping," Many schools will send in the mail a list of everything you need. If you've received this letter, read it over. Think, What do I already have? What do I need to buy? because you may find some spare pencils or folders in your house, saving you time and money. Make sure, though, that everything you find is reusable. If you find a ripped up binder, you'll definitely have to get a new one. As you find items, cross them off the list so you know what you still have to buy.


If you do not know what school supplies you need, don't worry. No. 2 pencils, pens, pencil sharpener, colorful highlighters, a notebook, a pencil case, erasers, a flash drive, a binder (1, 1 1/2, or 2 inch), and folders are usually a safe bet, depending on your grade. For younger grades (1-4) you probably won't need a binder, just a folder for homework and notes. You'll also probably need glue, scissors, and colored pencils in Elementary school. You could also call the school to ask what you'll need.
Take inventory of your closet. Do you need new clothes or shoes? Write down how many of everything you already have (that fits) so you'll know what to buy when you shop. Write down the number of tops, bottoms, sweaters/hoodies, pairs of socks, underwear, and shoes you have.;
, You could get a regular binder (great price but not very durable) or a zipper binder (very expensive but very durable). What kind you get is up to you, depending on your budget. Usually, zipper binders are $10-$20, with regular binders at only $1-$2. When getting a regular binder, try to look for ones with pockets to hold important papers. you'll also need dividers with these binders. Binders can be found at many office stores like Staples and Office Depot. You can also order them online, and you'll probably get a discount.

, You have different options, and it's completely up to you on what kind you get. Consider your grade before picking a backpack to buy. And, some are better for your back, some aren't as much. You can wear a different kind of backpack each year to see which you like best, or just to change it up. Backpacks can be found in many stores. Lots of department stores have a wide selection of backpacks. Prices can range from $10-$50 and even more. $20-$30 is a good price for an average backpack.


.Regular backpacks are good for your back, and can hold a lot of things in them! These backpacks are good for any grade, and can be held on one shoulder if wanted. Messenger bags have quick access, but you might not want to carry a lot of weight on one shoulder. Tote bags have a good amount of room and look professional, but, like a messenger bag, you may not want lots of weight on one shoulder. Backpacks on wheels don't add any weight. But, some schools do not allow them, so make sure that you are allowed before buying a backpack on wheels.
Make sure that you get a backpack that is a good size for you to handle. Put it on and see if it is uncomfortable. Keep in mind that you'll be putting in a lot of supplies. If you are in elementary school, get a medium sized bag, you won't need anything too big. For middle and high schoolers, try to get a larger backpack to hold everything you need.

, You can get these at many stores, not just office stores. Department stores like Target usually have these items at a great price. Look for deals (buy 1 get 1 free, buy 1 get 1 50% off, etc.). If you get mechanical pencils, you'll also have to get lead. Find colors or patterns you like, like a blue eraser instead of a regular pink one, shiny pencils instead of yellow, etc.

, It is always good to have new shoes every year. You'll need, of course, sneakers, boots for winter, ballet flats (girls), dress shoes, and sandals for warm weather. Some schools, however, do not allow flip flops. In middle and high school, you should probably buy an extra pair of sneakers for gym, especially if your regular ones are Converse. You should try to get shoes that have support on the bottom for your feet.


Know your shoe size before buying. Most stores have a device to measure your size. If not, check the size of the shoes you are currently wearing (if they still fit) and get a pair of shoes in that size.

, Focus on the fall and winter clothes, but since school starts in summer, don't be afraid to get a couple pairs of shorts. You should have at least 7 tops, bottoms, sweaters, underwear, and pairs of socks, one for each day of the week. If you have an older sibling, see what clothes they have. You never know, they may fit you, and you might like them! If you need some trendy ideas, you can read the lists below, but follow your own style.

,

Boys. Buy a few T-Shirts and polos in orange, blue, gray, red, green, or your favorite colors. Also get some sweaters for the winter. Get some denim jeans and a nice belt.
Girls. Purchase some Henley's in blue, pink, purple, white, or your favorite colors. Graphic Tee's are also nice. Get a few hoodies and sweaters for winter. Skinny jeans are in, but get flare or boot cut if you like them. Accessorize with a cute necklace.

Ask for donations.,
Ask your school to buy recycled or alternative paper products.,
Advocate for page-flipping catalogs.,
Use notebooks and tablets wisely.,
Request individual white boards.,
Think outside the classroom.",How to Save Paper in School2," Local businesses often have reams of unused paper goods that might include outdated letterhead, envelopes of the wrong size and old signs. Ask companies in your neighborhood or your parents' places of business to donate these paper goods to your school. (In many cases, it's tax-deductible!)

, Besides being better for the environment, recycled paper products can be less expensive, too. You can also find products made from non-tree sources such as hemp, bamboo, banana, kenaf and crushed stone.

, Ask your administration to forgo product catalogs and purchase supplies from companies that have websites or page-flipping catalogs and online ordering. Encourage your school to eliminate paper promotional materials and put all newsletters and catalogs online themselves.

, You can purchase notebooks made from recycled paper. Once you do, go a few steps further in your paper-saving efforts and use both sides of the paper. Write smaller (but still large enough for you to read what you've written) and avoid leaving a lot of white space on the page.


Don't do silly things with paper such as passing notes, making airplanes or spitballs or throwing it at your classmates' heads. These activities are both paper-wasting and trouble-making.

, Rather than work out math equations or create brainstorm lists or do other in-class activities on paper, students could use small white boards with ultra low-odor dry-erase markers. Some marker brands are even made from recycled materials and are refillable, too.

, Paper products are used in the kitchen, cafeteria and restrooms at school, so strategies for reducing paper waste should take these areas into account as well.


Be sure your school is buying napkins, paper towels and bathroom tissue made from recycled paper.
Lobby for hand dryers instead of paper towels.
Post reminder ""These Come From Trees"" stickers on napkin and paper towel dispensers to help remind people to reduce unnecessary use.

Set guidelines for acceptable paper.,
Secure collection boxes.,
Provide education.,
Chose a central location for paper storage.,
Keep enthusiasm high.,
Work around obstacles.",How to Save Paper in School3," A successful recycling program depends on the support of students, teachers, staff, administrators and custodians. Form a committee that's made up of individuals from each of these populations to develop a program that takes into account everyone's needs and addresses everyone's concerns.


Designate one person as the representative for each group so that they can explain the need for recycling to their peers and ask for their support. They can also help communicate program developments and changes and be the ""point person"" for questions that arise.

, In some cities, paper recycling is the law and collected paper will be picked up on scheduled trash days. In other locations, you'll need to find a drop-off point or pick-up service to take your paper. The website Earth911 has a search feature that allows you find recycling services in your area. You can also search online to find a local materials recovery center or recycling drop-off center and see if they'll accept your paper.


If you can't find a drop-off center for your paper, you may have to explore paying for a pick-up service to haul it away. Research costs associated with this to be sure if will ultimately benefit your school.

, Depending on how and where you'll dispose of your recycled paper, you may have to limit or separate what you collect. Some collection locations will accept ""single stream,"" meaning a variety of paper grades mixed in one collection box, or they'll want ""sorted stream"" drop-offs, meaning you'll need to separate papers by grades (there are five basic paper grade types.) Certain types may not be accepted at all. Find out what and how your collection agency takes and structure your program accordingly.



Old corrugated containers. Also known as “corrugated cardboard,” this kind of paper is typically found in boxes and product packaging.

Mixed paper. This broad category includes things like mail, catalogs, phone books and magazines.

Old newspapers. The name of this category says it all.

High grade de-inked paper. Your school will undoubtedly have the most of this kind of paper, which includes things such as envelopes, copy paper and letterhead.

Pulp substitutes. This paper is usually discarded scraps from mills, so it's unlikely you'll have to worry about it, although there's always a chance that it could be a part of paper products your school buys.

, See if your local recycling center can provide you with collection boxes; otherwise, purchase some plastic tubs to serve the purpose. Keep them all the same color and/or clearly mark them as paper collection boxes so that no one accidentally puts garbage in them.


If you must sort your paper, use labels or images of the kinds of paper that should be deposited into each different box.

, Not only do you need everyone on board for your program to be a success, but everyone should be well informed and clear as to how the program works. Consider asking environmental science or social studies instructors to devote a class period to discussing the guidelines of the recycling program. Or plan to have educational assemblies for explaining the program, including information about what kind(s) of paper is being accepted and the location of the collection bins.


Create a reference card with information about the program to distribute to everyone in the school. Or, to save paper, create a web site or page on your school's site where everyone can reference program guidelines.

, You'll need a place where you can store the collected paper between recycling drop offs or pick ups. The copy machine room may be a good choice or perhaps a section of a large storage closet.


Put safety first and do not allow large piles of paper to block exits or be stored near flammable chemicals. Check with your local code enforcement office to make certain you're in compliance with all applicable building and fire codes.

, Once your recycling program is off the ground, keep people excited about it by reporting on it's progress and recycling and savings goals you meet.


Make weekly or monthly announcements over the PA system or via your school's closed circuit television of the amount of paper that's been recycled to date. Remind everyone of the importance of maintaining the program and use the opportunity to clarify any confusion and address any questions or concerns that have been raised.
Plan field trips to your local recycling center or invite guest speakers to come to your school to discuss the value of a recycling program and its positive financial and environmental impact.

, If your school is reluctant to establish a recycling program, ask if you can conduct a simple paper waste audit to find out what is being thrown out and from where. Once you can show your school the amount of waste paper being generated and thrown out, those in charge may be more motivated to adopt recycling.

, Don't mix your notes up or you will make it harder to find what you're looking for. Write nicely, to make it easier to understand what you've written later. Another good thing to do is have folders with holes on the inside to put notes in.

, That way you can keep all of your pencils, pens, etc. in the pencil case. You'll know where they are, and you won't have to look for that one pencil. The case can get quite messy, so you should throw away broken pencils and everything you don't need.

, This may be humiliating for some, but it may become unavoidable. If you are desperate for new clothes for the school year, search through garage sales and pick out what you need.

, Clean notebooks of old writing and save them. Clear out folders and binders, erase markings on things you need, and keep all writing utensils.

, An abandoned pencil? Take it. A broken straight-edge compass? Take it. Anything from erasers, to flash cards. Anything you find.

Get a studying spot at home.,
Clean up your locker and/or your backpack.,
Keep your digital files in order.",How to Organize Your School Supplies2," Instead of spreading all your school supplies all around your house, keep it in that one place. Keep a couple of pencils, pens and rubbers in different jars, don't just let them flow all over your desk. If your desk has drawers, you shouldn't just throw random objects into them; mark them. For example, one of them you could use for textbooks, another for old homework, the next for other supplies, and so on.

, This will make everything easier if you're late for class. Using a shelf in your locker will help hold more books and binders too. If you organize your books so that each subject has one spot, just grab the pile. In your backpack, keep all your books and folders in the biggest ""room"".

, If you're using your laptop to take notes, clean it up once in a while. Make one folder called ""School"", and in that, name other folders with the subject you'll be using it for. Place all of your documents in their right place.

Add or remove supplies when needed.,
Clean out and repack your pencil case periodically.,
Get a case with compartments.,
Pick one with a durable fabric.,
Decide on the size.",How to Pack a Pencil Case for School," Each school year, students are responsible to bring the same types of supplies with them to class everyday. Though certain classes can call for some variety in supplies, downsize what to pack in your pencil case initially to optimize organization. Here are some necessities you could start with:Two lead pencils
One red pen, one blue pen, one black pen
Sharpener
Protractor
Scissors (5”)
Eraser
Compass
Glue stick
Highlighter
Calculator
Ruler;
, Put the items that will take up the most room first at the bottom of your case, such as calculators, scissors, or protractors. This will provide a base for your smaller items, such as pencils, pens, or sharpeners. Your case will be neater and easier to maneuver when looking for a certain item.


If using a case with a zipper, put the pencil case on its side with the zipper facing left or right. It will be easier to pack your supplies, and will help you to utilize the space inside the case.

, Since you already started with the necessities, adding in supplies based by grade or course should not be too difficult. If you are adding in any loose supplies, keep them contained before packing.


Elementary school supply lists usually call for colored pencils, crayons, and magic markers. To save space, choose the colors you use most for each, remove them from their box, and wrap each group together with rubber bands.
Middle or high school supply lists may call for post-it notes. Put the post-it notes in a small zip lock bag. This will make sure none of the notes rip off or get bent in the pencil case.

, Every month, clean out your pencil case to make it as accessible as possible throughout the year. As the school year progresses, it’s easy to let all of those pencil shavings and notes take over your case. Instead, throw out what you don’t need and replenish.


Get rid of any broken pencils or crayons.
Replace dulling highlighters.
Replenish glue sticks and erasers

, A pencil case with multiple compartments of different size will help you effectively pack your supplies. Try to get a case with stackable layers, in order to fit in as many supplies as needed.Organize each compartment with supplies of the same category and/or size.

Put the compass, protractor, and calculator together.



, Carrying a pencil case between classes as well as back and forth from home will definitely cause some wear and tear on the fabric. Choose a fabric that will be less likely to rip in between classes, so none of your supplies fall into your backpack or on the floor.


Try to get a pencil case made with nylon fabric. Not only is it easier to clean, it is strong enough to stay intact if you fill your pencil case to maximum capacity.Hard plastic pencil cases are durable, but make sure to keep track of how much supplies you try to pack. If you pack too much, you will be less likely to close the case because it has a lid instead of a zipper.

, A medium sized pencil case would be the best size for everyday classes. You may have a class where you may need more room for a ruler or a notepad, so a larger case would be suitable.


If after a few months of your school routine, you notice that you are not utilizing many of your supplies, scale down to a small pencil case. This will fit in any backpack, and could even be left out on your desk since it wouldn’t take up much space.
Some people find it best to only carry the necessities and keep a bigger pencil case in their locker for things that are specific to one class (geometry kit, watercolours, coloured pencils etc.)

Decide what you can budget for school supplies.,
Find out what supplies you need.,
Take inventory.,
Before you start shopping write a list of essentials.,
Check the sale ads and see if any the items on your list are on special.,
Go to a department or specialty store such as Walmart, Target (USA), Matalan; or Staples (UK); or Big W (Australia); or OfficeWorks (Australia).,
Don't be tempted to buy too many clothes for your child; stick to what you need.,
Backpacks and satchels are available in a range of prices.,
Avoid fashion and brand name products as these tend to be more expensive.

,
Let durable but cheap be the basis of your budget shopping.,
If the child might get made fun of for not wearing designer clothes, consider a consignment boutique that only sells designer.",How to Purchase All Back To School Items on a Budget,";
, Contact the school or the teacher and ask whether there is a list of required or recommended items. While you're inquiring, learn about the dress code so that you can steer clear of clothes that would violate it.

, Do you have supplies from last year that you can reuse? What clothes still fit your kids, and what do they need more of? Can their shoes and jackets go another year, or even a few more months?

, When you're out shopping, stick to your list.

, Do enough comparison shopping to know what items normally cost.

, These tend to stock a wide range of back to school goods from pens and notebooks to clothes.

, Remember that children grow quickly, so allow space for growth.

, Choose one that will be robust enough for the wear and tear of school life, but avoid brand name products for better value. Alternatively, if your child doesn't generally lose his/her backpack, consider spending a bit extra once to get one with a lifetime warranty.

,, If you buy something that is cheap and looks quite fragile, you will need to replace it sooner or later.

, That way, you can get that Juicy tote for $30, those Lucky jeans for $12, and that Abercrombie top for $7.

Locate a pencil case.,
Customize your pencil case, especially if the fabrics are plain.,
Rack up some supplies.,
Of course, you are not limited to this list but those items should definitely remain in your pencil case.

,
Stock up on extras that you keep at home.",How to Pack a Pencil Case," A makeup bag will work, but you can also buy another kind of box or pouch.;
, Sequins or rhinestones are easy to apply and you can put your name in fun patterns.

, Here is a list of things you should pick up from a local office supply store:


pens (black/blue and colored, ballpoint or gel-ink that won't run)






pencils (mechanical, so they don't stain the interior of the bag)






erasers (stick with the classics)






highlighters






white out/ correction tape






permanent markers (one black and one colored)

Binders.,
Folders.,
Notebooks.,
Filler paper.,
Pencils and pens.,
Pencil bag.,
Backpack and lunch box.,
Consider making your own tote bag or pencil case.",How to Reuse Old School Supplies," Binders are essential.


Gather up all your old ones and scrub off (if possible) any writing or marks. Fix any rips or tears.
Still looking ugly? Buy some cheap colored duct tape (they have every color under the sun) and wrap it. May sound silly but it makes for a cool style and creative trend.
If you just need decorations, see what you can collect for stickers. Bumper stickers, especially, can cover a multitude of sins.;
, Also pockets, dividers, and pouches of all sorts.


Get every folder in the house and erase marks, tape tears, and so on.
If you wrote on it with Sharpie, no problem. Just use some nail polish remover to get most of it off.
Also, get reinforcements if they're paper and meant to put in binder rings. Stapling and decorating work here, too.

, Old notebooks can be given a new lease of life and serve you well.


Gather all old spirals and rip out the used pages, paper scraps, and subject labels.
Write (on the front) the subject, your name, teacher, etc. Decorate it, make it yours.
Use all the pages this year, so that you deserve a new one next year.

, Loose-leaf paper. Call it what you want, but students go through it fast.


Watch for specials and buy two or three packs. This is a good opportunity to look for deals on other items you've used up, too, like notebooks.
Gather together all loose unused paper. Keep together under one big binder clip.

, These don't tend to wear out, but they may need to be cleaned off. Toss any that don't still write.

, Okay, so you have one. But is it usable? If the binder holes (if any) have ripped, staple them. Or if you're up to it, stitch on some reinforcement with a needle and thread. Clean out the inside and put your supplies inside.

, Plan to use these items from one year to the next, regardless of your budget. Therefore, always choose durable ones.


Empty out any old trash.
Wash them if you need to. Most will withstand hand washing, mild soap, cool water, and air drying. Prop it open so that air circulates over all the different surfaces. Allow plenty of time to air dry before you have to refill it.
Learn a bit of basic hand stitching and you can mend most tears. To dress things up or cover holes and worn spots, sew on patches. If you don't have patches showing where you've been, make your own by cutting up jeans that you've worn out or outgrown.

, You can make a basic tote bag out of old jeans. You can make your pencil case out of the same jeans, or out of duct tape. Be creative."
"
In each of your notebooks or binders, write down your combination as an addition problem.,
If you have a calendar handy, keep the combo on your birthday.

,
Write down your combination on a piece of paper.,
Make up a rhyme to memorize it.,
Write the combination in your backpack.,
If you have a cell phone, type in your locker number and save it as a contact in your phonebook.,
If you carry a daily planner or calendar in you purse, wallet, locker, etc, then write down the combination in code.",How to Remember Your New Locker Combination1," So if your combination was 17/5/37, you would write it as 17+5+37. Or, If they are smaller numbers or you're in a higher grade, do something like 17x5x37. If somebody saw it in your binder or notebook, they would think you were doing homework!;
,, Choose somewhere good to keep it safe.

, Let's say your combination is 1/44/7: 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 44 o'clock, seven even weaven to heaven. Strange, but it works.

, Just in case you forget it, write it in Sharpie on the inside of your backpack.

, For the name however, don't put locker # (people might snoop around on your phone and read it)! Instead, make up a name, example Mr L. N. (for Mr.Locker Number) or Mrs. Lockheart (LOCKheart).

, For example:


""Lunch with girls on the 6th of the 11th month at 9 o' clock "".
If the numbers are bigger, use this idea: ""On the 28 all 30 girls or guys in the (make up or use a club name you and your friends have) will meet for my cousins 16th birthday party.""

Assess your options to find the right book bag for you.,
Adjust your bag for the best fit.,
Find a bag with multiple compartments to help keep everything organized.,
Store your electronics separately.,
Protect your electronics from damage.,
Only pack essential items.,
Leave some of your things with your favorite teacher.,
Purchase ebooks instead of heavy text books.,
Choose a light laptop.,
Use one notebook for several subjects.,
Clean out your bag.,
Utilize each compartment of your bag for specific items so everything is easy to find.,
Decide the best order for the items in each section of your bag.",How to Survive a School with No Lockers," You have several options for carrying school supplies when there are no lockers. Make sure that you have enough space in the bag to fit your necessities, but you will also want to consider your comfort and well-being.Sling bags have one strap and are worn slung over one shoulder. Putting all of the weight on one shoulder could be problematic for your neck and back.
Backpacks have the advantage of two straps, which disperses the weight evenly.
If carrying your books is not an option for you, you can purchase a luggage bag, or a rolling briefcase or backpack. This will keep the strain off your back and body.;
, Even if you chose just the right bag to keep your back and shoulders from hurting, it will only work if you adjust it and wear it correctly. The best bag could still cause trouble if it is not adjusted and worn according to its design.The strap of a sling bag should run diagonally across your chest to keep the bag securely in place, and disperse some of the weight to your back and hip.
Adjust the straps of a backpack to the right length. You will know they are correct when the backpack has the most contact with your back.
Be sure the handle of a rolling bag is long or short enough to not cause you to twist as you pull the bag.

, Many bags are made with compartments of different sizes, which are often designed for specific purposes. When you are required to carry many items all day, it is helpful to have a system which helps you easily locate anything you may need.


If you carry a water bottle, look for a bag with a pocket on the side where you can slip your water bottle in and out regularly.
Since you are using this bag for school, you will need a space for pens and pencils. May bags have a pocket with slots stitched in specifically for the purpose of holding these items.
If your school allows you to carry a phone, look for a bag which has a pocket dedicated to your phone. Many backpacks have a pouch at the top of the bag. Other bags may have a side pocket for easy access and protection for your phone.

, If you are relying on computers and tablets for your text books or assignments, you will want to make sure they stay in one piece and remain functional. Keep your electronics safe from harm when you have them in your bag.Choose a bag with a separate section for storing your electronics, and only place electronics in this section.
Some bags have an elastic sling in the electronics section. This can be a good shock absorber if your bag gets dropped.
Air bladders are available in the electronics sections of some bags for extra protection.

, While electronic items are always developing and improving, some of their durability is still precarious. Screens are especially sensitive to pressure and impact. Its a good idea to invest in a protective cover when your are carrying electronics around all day. This will help protect it from damage as well as any dirt and dust which may build up in your bag and find it's way into your devices.


A little padding goes a long way for protecting your electronics from bumps, drops and dust. Place your computer or tablet inside a sleeve before placing it in your bag.
Consider getting a hard cover for your electronics. Hard covers can keep the screen from cracking under the pressure of your text books.

, You may have several things which would be fun to have with you all day, but not so fun to carry around. Think of school like a hiking trip when you pack. Only take the things you are really going to need for the day and leave the clutter at home.


If you know you will not need your text book on a particular day, because you have a test or are watching a movie that day, leave that book at home.
Carry only one pen, one pencil, and possibly one spare.
Leave forms of entertainment at home. This includes gaming devices, novels and toys.

, Many teachers in schools with no lockers are providing shelves within their classrooms to accommodate book bags. If you have too much to carry, ask your favorite teacher if you can leave some of your items in their classroom during the day.


If you bring items other than books and notebooks, these are good things to find another home for during the day. There may be a locker in the gym for workout clothes. You could leave your lunch in a classroom near the cafeteria.
Keep your items organized and be respectful of your teacher’s space.
Choose a classroom which is convenient to stopping in between classes if you need something in the middle of the day.

, Text books are likely the heaviest part of your load. Find out if the book is available online and purchase it as an ebook. Carrying one computer, tablet or kindle is going to be much lighter than six or seven text books., If you are carrying a computer, you will want to make sure that it is not adding too much to your load. Computers with a smaller display screen and thinner body are going to fit more easily in your bag and add less weight to your load.Some examples of good, light-weight computers are the MacBook Air, Dell Latitude XPS 13, and Asus ZenBook UX305.
Consider using an iPad or tablet instead of a computer.
Covers for tablets are available with built-in keyboards.

, Instead of carrying one notebook for each subject, combine as many as you can into one notebook. This will reduce the amount of paper weight you are carrying and increase the space available in your bag.Try a binder with specific sections for each class. You can control how much paper is in each section and have only slightly more paper than you need for taking notes each day.
Try starting one subject at the front of a notebook and another subject in the back until you meet in the middle.
Keep everything in a notebook, folder or binder. Loose paper can get lost in your bag or crushed under other items creating cluster or frustrating disorganization.

, Once you no longer need the items in your bag, get rid of them so you aren’t carrying things around unnecessarily. You can throw them away, or keep them at home for now if you might need them later.Tear old pages out of your notebooks if you no longer need those notes.
Clean out your bag at the end of each week, and do a mass cleaning at the end each term when you should be able to remove a lot of finished work.

, You will have everything that used to be in your locker in your bag. This can be overwhelming if you don't have a system to find what you are looking for.Use a bag with multiple compartments. Assign items to each compartment. Keep your pens and pencils in one place, your books in another, your notebooks in another, and so on.The largest compartments should be used for the largest items in your bag, which is likely your textbooks, then the next largest would fit your notebooks.
Place the items you will be accessing most often in the outside pockets. This could include things like pens, pencils, your wallet, and lip balm.

, Not only do your want to use each compartment for specific items, you will want to have an order to the items within that compartment. Depending on how much space you have, you may want to focus on the best fit, or the easiest way to track your items.


Just like you placed the largest items in the largest pockets, you will want to follow this plan within each compartment. Place the largest items in the back and fill the compartment largest to smallest. It will be easier to see everything in that section and be able to identify each item at first glance.
Consider ordering the items in each section in the same order you have classes. Your first class will be the first in the section and your second class items will be in the second position.
If you are carrying multiple binders, which are thicker on the inside and thinner at the ends, you can alternate the direction of the binders within your bag. Put one in with the thick side on the left, then flip the next to have the thick side on the right. This should square off the two binders and help save space.

, One benefit of a locker is having room to store all the items you might need during your day. If you're using your locker for school purposes, storing a range of basic school items in your locker will help you be prepared for anything:


Buy a very cheap, clear pencil case. Clear is better for this particular use.
Buy a few cheap pens and pencils. These don't need to be top quality. You don't need to splurge out on them, you can probably get a small packet for cheap. Just in case! You should stick with just HB pencils because they are the cheapest.
Buy a small packet of colouring pencils. These don't need to be an expensive brand either. You can even get the small mini packs of 12 colouring pencils for about 50p! You can also get a small packet of crayons or felt-tips if you feel comfortable buying these for purpose you may not use very often.
Buy a geometry set. This comes in especially handy, these can often break or get lost easily! Make sure this comes with a ruler too.
Grab a calculator. This doesn't need to be especially expensive, or as 'fancy' and 'complicated' as your main one, just a regular calculator in case you lose your main one!
You might want to keep a spare notebook in there too!
Get a good book and shove it in there too, just in case you have a reading class and forget your book.
A spare folder is always good to have, just to keep old assignments or old sheets and old letters in, so it doesn't clutter your room but you still have it, just in case!

, It is a good idea to keep a mini toiletry set in your locker so you are prepared for make-up catastrophes. This helps for after gym and swimming.


Buy a toiletry bag. This doesn't have to be huge, but it should be big enough to fit everything you need.
Add wet ones, baby wipes or face wipes! These will come in especially handy on hot days or if you have done long jump or cross country, or you just happen to be grimy or feel a little sticky!
Pack hand sanitizer. Just a mini compact one and that you can use when you think you've been exposed to germs.
Breath spray, breath strips, mints, or gum. This comes in handy when you need a bit of refreshment, and before you say hi to the boy/girlfriend!
Deodorant. A travel sized one will be perfect.
Body mist/spray. A mini one is much better and cheaper.
Pack extras of your make-up kit if desired: face powder, concealer, blush, oil blotting sheets, dry shampoo, hand cream, mascara, eyeliner, etc, as well as a hairbrush/comb and mini mirror.

, If you ever need any of the following, make sure you've got a spare in your locker: pain-killers, water, plasters/band-aids, mini sewing kit, snacks, earphones, air fresheners, etc.

Deodorant. Even though, almost everyone uses it daily, sometimes we sweat a little more than expected. This is always good to have on hand.






Body Splash/Spray. For a light scent. But be sure to check with your school before bringing this because some schools don't allow spray perfumes, deodorants or the like.






A hair brush. To comb down your hair after gym class. This could also be used if you want to have a smooth ponytail during gym class.






A couple of extra hair-ties, bobby pins/clips, and maybe a headband. This is for when you want to put up for hair if you start to sweat.






Baby wipes. This is optional, but is very useful. It could be used to clean up your hands, or to freshen up your face after you've sweat or any other places like you neck, arm pits,etc.






A mirror. You can get one of the magnetic mirrors to put in your locker, or just get a handheld mirror. Which ever is best for you.

, Repeat this action 11 more times. 7 of the numbers you get will be between two digits -- ignore those. Continue with the 5 outliers. Of those 5, 1 should not end in the same digit. That's your third number.


Obviously, it's very important to know exactly where the lock stops at. Be diligent and take a keen eye to your lock.

, You're now down to just 100 possible combinations -- that's 15 minutes' work. Your third number actually allows you to eliminate possible first and second numbers, believe it or not. It may take a bit, but it will open with perseverance.

Determine the resale value of the textbook.,
Evaluate the market for each book.,
Price your book to sell.,
Create an attractive flyer.,
Post your flyers.,
Place an ad in your school newspaper.,
Make a plan to meet your buyer.,
Sell your textbook.,
Take down your flyers and remove your advertisements.,
Alternatively, you can avoid the flyer process altogether, or at least augment it considerably, by posting your book for sale on a free, university-focused textbook exchange website.

",How to Sell Your Used Textbook to Another Student on Your Campus," Your local and/or campus bookstore will be holding a buyback at the end of the semester. Find out how much they'll give you for each book as well as how much they're selling the books for. Write these numbers down. You can also get a quote from an online bookstore or two.;
, You'll have the best chance of selling books that are going to be used in the next semester. You can usually find this out at the bookstore, or you can ask your professor or check the class web page. Some books that won't be used again on your campus may be used at another school. If this is the case, you might get a better price if you try to sell the book online.

, You are competing with local bookstores, online sellers, and even other students. Evaluate the prices and buying options available--include considerations such as shipping costs and the condition of your book compared to others. Price your book higher than the lowest online offer, yet lower than the used book price the bookstore is offering. If you want to sell really fast, set your price lower than any other option. Just remember to keep your price high enough above the bookstore's buyback price to compensate for your time and any advertising expenses.

, This can easily be done in most word-processing software programs using text art, or you can make one by hand and photocopy it. Put a big, bold headline such as ""Book for Sale"" or ""Buy My Book"". Include detailed book information, such as author, title, ISBN, edition, publisher, copyright date, and price of the book. Include what course it is used for, and describe the condition of the book (e.g. good shape, minor shelf wear, some highlighting). Provide your contact information, such as a campus email address or phone number. Make it easy for a potential buyer to contact you by making the bottom edge of your flyer a section of tear-off tabs with the book title and your contact information (History Book, James@college.edu).

, Print off several copies, at least a dozen. Locate places on or around campus which are high traffic areas and which have a bulletin and/or announcement board. Examples include the campus cafeteria, departmental offices, and the student activities center. Get approval from the administrator of the bulletin board before you post your flyer; otherwise it may be removed. Make a list of the locations where you post your fliers so that you can take them all down when your book is sold.

, If you're able to inexpensively place an ad in the paper or, better yet, place a free ad, do so. Include the same information as you did on the flyer, but shorten it if you have to.

, Once you are contacted, you will need to meet the potential buyer to sell the textbook. Decide when and where. Pick a public place that is safe and convenient for both of you. Be sure to tell them what payment options you will accept.

, When a buyer contacts you, be polite, and make arrangements to meet. Bring some cash in case you need to make change. Bring the book. Meet the buyer, accept their money and give them the book.

, Be a good citizen and don't waste other people's time. You also probably don't want to continue to get calls or emails about a book you've already sold.

Sort your papers by class.,
Go through each stack and remove old papers.,
See if you can fit the remaining papers into one binder.,
Insert a colored divider into your binder for each class.,
Insert a three-hole folder into each class section.,
Use a plastic sleeve to protect important papers.,
Organize your other papers to see if you need white dividers.,
Put in the rest of your papers.,
Add lined paper for taking notes.",How to Organize Your Middle School Binder1," If your binder or notebooks are full of notes from different classes, in no particular order, start by arranging them into separate piles. Arrange these piles in a row according to the order you attend those classes.;
, Remove graded work and old assignment instructions, and store them in a separate binder or folder to leave at home and help you study for tests. Set aside classwork from previous years, returned projects, and non-school-related papers. Save any of these that you think will be useful for studying, along with any projects you or your parents want to keep for your own enjoyment. Throw away the rest.


Keep the ""at home"" binder or folders in an obvious place where they won't get lost in clutter, such as on a bookshelf in your room.

, Having just one binder for all your classes can be great for keeping yourself organized, since you don't have to keep track of a separate notebook for each class.If you have a giant stack of papers, try to separate them into two binders using one of these systems:


Try using one binder for classes before lunch, and one binder for classes after lunch. If you have a locker at your school, you only need to carry one of these around at a time, but remember to pick up both before you leave for the day.If your school has Monday-Wednesday-Friday classes and Tuesday-Thursday classes, separate your papers into two binders so you only need to take one binder to school each day. Remember to put the right binder in your backpack the night before each school day.

, Dividers are just a colored sheet of paper, usually with a small tab where you can write the name of a class. Put colored dividers into the binder in the order your classes happen. For instance, if your first class is math and your second is English, put a blue divider labeled ""Math"" at the front of your binder, followed by a red divider labeled ""English.""

, Two-pocket folders are a great tool to have, since they let you put in and take out papers without having to open and close the binder rings.Don't use this for all papers. It's best for handouts or homework assignments that are due in the next day or two, since they won't be staying in the binder for long.

, Most classes have a syllabus, assignment list, or other papers that you need to look at throughout the semester. For each class, find a plastic sleeve or ""sheet"" protector with three holes and put it in the binder after the folder for that class. Keep each important paper in a separate sleeve to protect it from tearing.

, Before you put the rest of the papers in your binder, organize the papers from each class from oldest to newest. If you have more than fifteen papers in the stack, use white paper dividers to organize them into categories. These are blank sheets with tabs, just like the colored plastic dividers you already have in there, but the different look should make it obvious that they divide papers within one class, instead of dividing multiple classes.Here are some examples of how you could divide papers from one class into multiple sections:


For almost any class, you could use three white paper dividers labeled ""Handouts,"" ""Homework,"" and ""Notes.""
If a teacher gives you tests on specific topics, organize your class material by those topics to make studying easier. For instance, label your English class dividers ""Reading Assignments"" and ""Vocabulary.""

, Once you've decided how to sort your papers, put each paper after the colored divider for its class, and after the white divider for its category if you are using those. Sort your papers in each section from earliest to latest, to make them easier to find.

, Put in about ten to twenty sheets of lined paper for each class. You'll almost certainly need more than this during the semester, but you don't need to add it all now. Keeping less paper in your binder makes it easier to find specific notes, and reduces the weight you need to carry around every day.


Add graph paper for your math or science classes if your teacher requests it.

Understand what you need.,
Gather your materials.,
Make sure you get a binder that you're comfortable with.",How to Organize Your Binder for School1," If your school has a school supply list, you'll need to follow that as best you can. Not necessarily to the letter, but try to have whatever binders or folders/notebooks, calculators, etc. that the teacher wants.;
, Make sure you have the essential school supplies and materials for your binder such as pencils, erasers, highlighters, sticky notes, coloured pens and so on. Many people prefer to put these supplies inside their backpack, but I think it's better to keep them in your binder so you would have them wherever you go and not forget it in your backpack.

, Some binders are made just for separate subjects and others are made to place all your subjects in one binder. There are many types, so pick the one you want!

"
"
Adjust your backpack.,
Fill up your backpack.,
Wear your backpack.,
Personalize your backpack.",How to Wear a Backpack1," Before you fill up your backpack and start wearing it, you will want to properly adjust your backpack. Adjusting your backpack can help make it more comfortable and help prevent injury. Make sure your backpack fits properly before you start regularly using it.Most backpacks will have an area on the straps that you can use to adjust the length of the straps themselves.
Pulling more or less strap through the buckle will adjust how long the straps are.
Adjust the straps of the backpack until it fits snugly against your back.
Avoid leaving too much slack in the straps of the backpack as wearing the backpack too low can hurt your back.
Make sure both straps are an equal length to ensure that the weight of your backpack is evenly distributed.;
, Once your backpack is correctly adjusted and customized, you can start to fill it up with whatever you need to carry. Be careful when packing your bag to prevent fragile items from being broken. Take some time to see how your items will best fit in your bag before putting it on to wear it.Fragile items should go on top of more durable ones.
Some items may have an usual shape or sharp corners. Try to position these so that they don't poke you in the back.
Make sure any containers storing liquids are secure before adding them to your bag.
Don't carry more than 10%-15% of your body weight in your backpack to avoid injury., Now that your bag is full and adjusted, it's ready to wear. Most backpacks will have two shoulder straps that will both need to be used. Put an arm through each of the shoulder straps to make sure the weight is properly held by your backpack. Take note of how comfortable the bag feels with items in it and make adjustments if needed.Do not wear your backpack with only one shoulder strap. Each arm should go through a shoulder strap.
Backpacks should not drop below the waist level. Don't wear your backpack slung low on your back.You may need to adjust how you packed your items to evenly distribute the weight.
Some backpacks will have an additional waist strap that can add more stability when worn.

, After you have found a great backpack, you can start to personalize it. Personalizing your backpack can help keep it identifiable and allow you to express yourself at the same time. Consider adding some contact information or other personal stylistic elements like patches, drawings, or tags to make your backpack feel like your own.


Writing your name and phone number on your bag can help it get back to you if lost.
Customizing your bag can help you identify it easily if it's near similar bags.

"
"
Organize your binder each night before class.,
Use a planner.,
Keep supplies left at home in a special place.,
Color code your other supplies to match your binder.",How to Organize Your Middle School Binder2," Pick a time each day to go through your backpack and sort your papers and other supplies. Move graded work and old handouts to a folder you keep at home, so you can use them to study later. Check that all your homework assignments are packed into the right folder in your binder.


Some people remember to do this more often if they organize their binder right after they get home. Waiting too long can make you unwilling to return to ""school mode.""

, A daily planner or portable calender makes keeping track of assignments much easier. Many people write down each assignment in the space provided for the day it is due. If you keep forgetting to look ahead at your assignment, however, you can try a different system that keeps all your current assignments in the same place:Each time you are given a new assignment, write it down in your planner in the space for today' date. Write the due date next to the name of the assignment.
Each evening after school, look at your planner's entry for yesterday's date. Cross out any assignments you've completed, then re-write the names of all uncompleted assignments in today's date.

, Notebooks, binders, and returned assignments can easily get lost in a pile of clutter when you leave them at home. Prevent this by clearing space on a bookshelf or drawer, and always keep your notebooks in the same place. Put all papers left at home in a special folder for that class, separate from the one in your binder.

, Ideally, you won't need extra notebooks, but some teachers will require you to use them. If they do, make it easy to remember which is which by keeping them color coded. For example, if you keep your math papers after a blue divider in your binder, use a blue notebook and supply case for your math class."
"
Pick from your options.,
Buy a good quality binder.,
Buy dividers.,
Clearly label each divider with whatever subject/class you want.,
Have something to take notes on/in.,
Keep lined paper.,
Keep your binder in order either from the order of your classes, or by color, etc.,
Try keeping a binder for each class.,
Have dividers for each subject.,
Try color-coding your subjects.,
Try to keep everything you might need inside your binder.",How to Organize Your Binder for School2," Basically there's 3 options: 1 big binder (3 inch) for everything, a bunch of little binders, (1 inch or half inch, 1 for each class) or 3 or 4 medium sized-binders (1 and a half to 2 inches). Some people like to carry around a small binder at school and transfer their old work to a bigger binder at home(3inch). Then their bag won't be too heavy with the extra weight from textbooks and notebooks. Pick whichever one your school allows/you want.

, Your binder is something you want to last through the whole year and some of the binders available definitely will not. Remember that sometimes it is worth the extra couple of dollars to get a long lasting binder.

, You must have dividers. Preferably with pockets, so you don't need folders. They're not expensive, depending on how many you buy. They usually come in packs of 5 and 8. Get dividers with pockets.

, It's helpful to have the dividers in order of your classes. i.e. If math is your first class, then your first divider would be math.

, Notes are an important part of getting into higher grades. The older you get, the more notes you'll take, so have a spiral or some paper to take notes. (If your school doesn't allow spirals, because some don't, get a composition book and put it in the pocket of that subject's divider.

, Your pencil bag, and your planner/agenda at the front of your binder, because these are important materials that you use most often. Keep your schedule in a page protector at the front, or slip it in the clear front of your binder.

, If you keep your binder in order either by color or by classes or any other method, you will have no trouble whatsoever during the school year. It'll be so much easier to find your papers!

, Some classes require a binder specifically for their subject.

, Organize your work and notes into categories such as notes, grades, homework, assignments.

, For example: let's say science is blue. You'd get a blue half-inch binder, blue dividers (if you can, because most dividers come multicolored), a blue folder, blue highlighter- whatever else you need for science would be blue. Everything. So if you you're trying to pack for science, in your locker you'd see a blue binder and folder- you'd know immediately that's science.

, For some subjects you need specific things and it is easier to keep that object in your binder. Another thing which is really useful is an insertable binder hole punch which will ensure you place all your papers in WHEN you get them. If you don't do this then your binder won't be as organised.

Think about what type of hiking backpack you need.,
Measure your torso.,
Fit your backpack.,
Try on the backpack.",How to Wear a Backpack2," Not all hiking trips will be the same and there are varying styles of backpacks that can meet the demands of these differences. Depending on the length of your hike and the gear you need to carry you will need to purchase a backpack with the correct frame style.Backpacks with external frames are mainly used for heavy and asymmetrical loads.
An internal frame backpack might be right for you if you need to maintain stability and don't need to carry heavy items.
Frame-less backpacks are for those hikers who don't need to carry much gear with them and like to move quickly on their hike.

, Hiking backpacks will need to be fitted exactly to the size of your torso. Any backpack that isn't the right size won't fit correctly and will be uncomfortable or may cause injury. Measure your torso's length and hip width before you buy your backpack to ensure a great fit.


Measure your torso's length by starting from the top bump at the base of your neck down to your hip level.
Measure your hips to make sure that the hip belt will fit. Your hip measurement will be taken just above where your pants normally rest.

, Before you load up your backpack and head out hiking you will need to properly fit your backpack. Try wearing your backpack and then making adjustments using the straps on your backpack where needed. There will generally be four main areas to adjust including the hip-belt, shoulder straps, load lifters, and sternum straps.The hip-belt should fit snugly around your hips and will support much of the weight.
Shoulder straps should pull the bag tight against your back but not actually carry much of the weight.
Some backpacks will have load-lifting straps. These should relieve the weight from your shoulders and help keep it properly distributed.
The sternum strap will pull the weight up and away from your shoulders and should fight tightly and comfortably across your chest.

, When it comes to hiking backpacks, it is ideal to visit a store where you can try on the backpacks in person. Although you might know your measurements, each backpack might fight differently in actuality. Try on plenty of backpacks before purchasing one to make sure you find the right fit.If you are unable to visit a store you may still be able to try a backpack and return it free of charge if the manufacturer allows for it.

Consider what size you will need.,
Think about how often you will use your backpack.,
Select your favorite style.,
Buy your backpack.",How to Wear a Backpack3," The size of your backpack will vary depending on what you plan on carrying in it. Decide on what items you will regularly be using your backpack to carry and plan on buying a bag that will easily accommodate them all.


If you need to carry bigger items or many small items you may need to buy a large backpack.
Buy smaller backpack if you don't plan on carrying much with you regularly.
Think about how easy your backpack will be to store when you arrive at school or work.
Whichever size you choose, you should never carry more than 15% of your body weight., When shopping for your backpack you will want to consider the durability and quality of it before purchasing one. Think about how often you plan on using your backpack and buy a backpack to match your needs.


Higher quality backpacks can last longer but may cost more.
Low cost backpacks may be ideal for occasional usage or carrying lighter items with you.
Wider straps can make carrying heavy loads easier on your back.Cushioned or padded backs can help soften the weight., Since you will be wearing your backpack you will want to select one that matches your personal taste and style. Backpacks come in almost any style, color, or design that you can imagine. Take your time and find one that matches your needs and looks great.


If you plan on bringing the bag everywhere try to find one that is neutral in style or one that matches most of your clothes.
If you are taking your backpack to school or work try to avoid any imagery or styles that might not be appropriate.

, After you have thought about which backpack might best suit your needs and style it's time to buy it. Once you buy your backpack you can adjust it and start putting it to use, carrying your important items with you wherever needed.


Compare prices offered by different vendors before buying your backpack to get the best deal.
If you are buying on-line there may be added costs for shipping.
Buying in person can allow you to get a better feel of the quality and style of the backpack.

Decide if you want a notebook or binder before the first week of class.,
Throw away or recycle anything that you’re not going to need in the next few weeks or newest unit.,
Use your dividers to make a section for each of your classes.,
Put a three-ring plastic envelope in your binder to carry other supplies such as pencils, flashcards, and CD's.,
Keep your notebook organized by checking each section and throwing away unwanted papers at the end of the school day.",How to Organize Your School Notebook," Choose one that fits your style, your schedule, and your usual book bag.


Check to make sure you can, in fact, use one big binder for all of your classes. Sometimes teachers collect the notebooks and do checks, so you don't want them to have to hunt for the section that corresponds to their class. Also, if the check takes more than a day, you'll be left without your materials for other classes.
There's usually a section in the syllabus that you received at the beginning of the year that details how a given teacher wants you to set up your notebook. Otherwise, follow the steps below.;
, Toss out any doodles, or old worksheets of no reviewing help to you.

, If you will need to take notes for a section in your binder, store loose leaf paper at the ends of the sections.

, Put any homework due in the right sections so that they will be easy to find.

, Making it a daily routine will mean that it never takes too much time.

Choose a stuffed animal.,
Measure the length of the animal's back seam.,
Select a zipper, fabric for the lining (1 yd or less), flexible fabric glue, curved needles, and upholstery thread.,
Select where you want the opening to begin and end on the animals back, this should match with the length of the zipper purchased.,
Create the lining for you backpack.,
Once glue is dry, remove any pins from neck, arm and leg holes.,
Next, stitch the pouch in place using the flaps so that the zipper opens top to bottom along the opening in the back seam.,
Now go back and add fabric glue to strap attachments to reinforce stitches.,
Allow glue to dry 24 hours.

",How to Make a Stuffed Animal Backpack," The animal should have at least a 8 to 10 inch (20.3 to 25.4 cm) torso section and a relatively flat back with a center seam. The center will lose most of its stuffing, so shift stuffing around to see how the head will look when loosely supported.;
, You will select a zipper at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) shorter than the back seam to allow for 2 inches (5.1 cm) above and below the opening.

, You will also need either rope, decorative rope trim, or webbed strap for the backpack straps.

, With the upholstery needle and thread reinforce the back seam above and below where you will put the opening by stitching tightly across the seam 5 or 6 times. After this is done carefully open the back seam of the animal and remove torso stuffing. You may want to ensure the stuffing in the head, arms and legs stays in place. You can either stitch loosely across the openings to create a barrier, or cut a piece of your lining material and glue it over the opening. Pin the fabric in place until the glue dries, but don't forget to remove the pins later.

, The basic shape for your lining is a mushroom. The width of the stem should be the same as the length of your zipper. The round part of the mushroom should roughly be the size of your animals tummy. You will be sewing two mushroom shaped pieces into a pouch with a zipper and two flaps at the top. Create a pattern and cut two pieces and place them with preferred side of fabric facing in. Start by sewing halfway around the round part of the mushroom shaped pieces from where the stem meets the round part to the top of the round mushroom part. Next put in the zipper. The zipper should go across the base of the round part of the mushroom, across the top of the stem. The base of the zipper should be on the side you stitched together. Put in zipper and make sure it works well. Sew the rest of the way around the round part of the mushroom shape. Be sure to reinforce the stitching at the other side of the round portion. Do not sew together the ""stem pieces"" just the round parts. You will not be turning this inside out. The inside of the pouch is all that will be seen You are leaving the two flaps to attach the pouch to the animal.

, Measure the length you want for the backpack handles, and cut two pieces of rope or webbing the correct length. Melt ends with lighter to prevent fraying. Select where the straps should attach to animal and pin in place. Check for proper fit and hang, adjust if necessary. Hand stitch straps in place tightly. Triple, even quadruple stitch the straps.

, Flaps should be inside fur or animal. Again stitch tightly and repeat. Also tack top of pouch to area above and bottom of pouch to area below zipper along seam. Make sure zipper opens and closes freely. If all functions correctly, then ad fabric glue along the inside edge of the seam to add strength to stitches and hold fur down to fabric. Keep it neat and out of the zipper. The zipper can be covered with masking tape to make sure no stray glue gets in the zipper.

, Keep it neat and if needed use fur to hide the glue.

Use folders.,
Use your locker.,
Review your schedule.,
Clean it out.,
Spread out the weight.,
Leave your textbooks at home.,
Carry some items outside your backpack.",How to Lighten Your Backpack," Most of the weight in your backpack is probably coming from your binder. Get a nice folder for each class! This will greatly reduce the weight. If your teachers say you need a binder, try getting a smaller binder, or even using a separate, small one for each class. If you can't do any of the above, just organize and clean out your binder.;
, If you attend a school that has lockers, use them! If you finish your homework during study hall or another class, store it in your locker and pick it up the next day. Put all your textbooks and heavy items in there, and take them out when you need them. Visit your locker at lunchtime and, if you have time, during passing time before your next class.

, Know which books you need at what times. Carry only the books you need for one or two classes at a time.

, This is pretty obvious. Sometimes your backpack can get cluttered and filled with unnecessary items.


Take everything out. Go through it remove old assignments, trash, and anything else you don't need to carry around.
Pare down the supplies you carry, too. It's wise to carry a spare pen and pencil, but you probably don't need ten. This goes for personal items, too. Carry a travel-sized hairbrush if you want one, but skip the bulging makeup bag or trim it to just the basics.
Clean periodically, perhaps once per week.

, Your backpack will feel heavier if all the weight is in one place. It'll pull on your back. Try spreading all the weight out evenly, and putting the heavier things closer to your back.


Use both straps. Using both straps spreads the load that you do have to carry over both shoulders. Look for a backpack rather than a messenger bag or tote bag with only one strap. Also, next time you purchase a backpack, look for something with a waist strap and even a chest strap. These help to distribute the weight further.
Adjust the straps so they're a comfortable length. On most backpacks, you simply pull down on the end of the strap to shorten and pull up on the clip to lengthen.

, This will depend upon the class and the teacher, but if you don't need the book in class, leave it at home for reference and homework.


Talk to your teachers if having textbooks in class is a requirement. You may be able to bring your book only on days when you need it, or you may be able to leave it at home if you ask.

, This may mean not having your hands free, but carrying your lunch box, water bottle, gym bag, or musical instrument in your hand rather than your backpack could help spread out the weight and the bulk. Leave these items in a locker, too, if you can.

Decide what do you want - what color, what kind.,
Look up splatter backpacks online.,
Buy fabric paint, or acrylic paint.,
Get started, but consider some things before you paint your backpack.,
Follow this procedure to paint:


Fill every pocket and zipper with newspaper.,
Dry it out.,
Flip it onto the other side and splatter it again!",How to Paint Splatter Your Backpack," What colors do you want to use on your backpack? Do you want to use your current backpack, or get a new backpack? What kind of backpack do you want?;
, This can help you get inspiration for the type of backpack you want to decorate, and what colours you could use.

, If you're using acrylic paint, you need to buy the fabric median, too. Paint brushes are also recommended; a 3/4 inch (usually the largest size brush in a brush package at Walmart) is the best brush size you're going to get. You can buy these at major craft stores.


Get an inch size brush, and/or an inch and a half brush size too, if you want to have different sized splatters on your backpack.

,


Do this outside and set out a couple of feet of newspaper. You can do this inside, but it can make a big mess!
Make sure you change into some old clothing you don't care about. You don't want your new clothes covered in paint! Putting on gloves is also a big help.
If you're using acrylic paint and wonder ""Why do I need the fabric median?"" or ""How much fabric median do I need to add to my paint?"" Then you are just being smart and thinking ahead! The fabric median is used to make the paint flexible on fabric, so that way it doesn't crack or flake off the backpack.
Read the instructions printed on the bottle before you do anything. You should add half the amount of fabric median of the paint you're using. (Example: for every 2 oz. of paint you add 1 oz. of fabric median. For every 6 tbs. of paint you add 3 tbs. of fabric median. Don't really add this much paint!)

When measuring the paint, it doesn't have to be a real measurement. It could just be an old spoon. But it will get stained and it won't wash out easily, so make sure it's something that isn't very valuable to you.


Always wash your brushes thoroughly so that way you don't mix the paints. Rubbing the brush on a paper towel after wash is recommended if you are switching between paints.
Get paper cups

,
Lay it flat on the ground that you covered with newspaper. Now it's time to let your imagination flow!
Dip your brush and flick at the backpack. The harder you flick, the more splatters you get.

Insert the course’s “Notes” tab and paper.,
Repeat this process for each course section.,
Organize the “To-Do” section.,
Three-hole punch loose papers.,
Place returned assignments and tests into a filing cabinet.,
Mark significant information and dates with flags and highlighters.",How to Organize Your Binder," A cover page helps to distinguish one binder from another binder. At the very least, the cover page lists a title. If your binder only holds papers for one course, this title may be the title of the course. If you are using the binder for multiple classes, you may wish to create a more general cover page. Label the binder “Monday/Wednesday/Friday Classes” or “Morning Courses.” You may also wish to include your name or the semester.There are several ways to create a cover page:


Download a cover page from the internet and personalize it with your information.
Design your own cover page using word processing or design software.
Make a cover page from scratch—use scrapbook paper or cardstock, permanent markers or colored pencils, and stickers or stencils.;
, Section dividers distinguish one section from another section. Create one section divider per course, a “To-Do Now” section divider, and a “To-Do-Later” section divider. Divide the sections with a labeled and or decorated piece of paper.There are several ways to create a subsection divider:


Download a template from the internet.
Use word processing or design software to design your own section divider. Experiment with cool fonts and add clipart or pictures from the internet.
Make a section divider from scratch—use scrapbook paper or cardstock, permanent markers or colored pencils, and stickers or stencils.
You may wish to include the following information on your course section dividers: Course title(s), classroom number(s), the name(s) of your professor(s) or teacher(s), and the semester or school year.
Label the two “To-Do” section dividers “To-Do Now” and “To-Do-Later.”

, Tabs are labels that protrude from a piece of paper that serves as a divider. They allow you to easily locate and turn to a specific point in your binder. Each tab represents one subsection. You will need two tabs per course and one tab for your “To-Do” section.Label the first tab for each course, “Handouts.”
Label the second tab for each course, “Notes.”
Label the “To-Do” section tab, “To-Do List.”
You may use a permanent marker, label maker, or printer to label your tabs.

, Retrieve your first section divider and first course tab. Slip the divider into a sheet protector or three-hole punch the divider. Place the section divider followed by the first tab onto the binder’s left rings.If you want additional folder pockets without the bulk of the traditional folder, purchase tabs with pockets.

, In the beginning of a course, you will receive several important handouts from the teacher. You may receive a course syllabus, assignment calendar, and or style guide. Slide these papers into sheet protectors and place them at the front of the “Handouts” subsection. As the course progresses, you will receive more handouts. File these behind the other handouts in chronological order.Create an “Important Dates” sheet for each course. As the school year progresses, it often becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of important dates. Compile a list of all important assignment dates, due dates, and test dates for each course to help yourself stay up-to-date. Type or record the dates by hand and place the paper at the front of the course’s “Handouts” section.

, Retrieve the course’s “Notes” tab. Insert it into the binder. Behind the “Notes” tab, place 25 to 50 pages of lined binder paper or graph paper.

, Insert your second section divider and the course’s “Handouts” tab into the binder. Insert your handouts. Insert the course’s “Notes” tab and paper., After organizing each course, insert your “To-Do List” tab into the binder. Place the “To-Do Now” section divider into the binder—this section will contain assignments you have to complete within the next one to two days. Insert the “To-do Later” section divider into the binder—this section will contain assignments you can complete at a later date., An organized binder is easy to navigate—you should know the approximate location of each paper. This is not possible when you insert loose sheets in between papers or fill folders full of papers. Three-hole punch the papers you wish to keep in your binder. Insert the papers into the correct section and subsection.If the paper is important, place it into a sheet protector.

, An overstuffed binder is more difficult to keep organized. In addition to throwing away unnecessary papers, you should remove returned assignments and tests from your binder. Organize these assignments and tests and place them in a filing cabinet or box., Even in the best organized of binders, it is possible to lose sight of an essential fact or important date. Find a way to catch your own attention. Consider using a flag to mark significant information or highlight dates you need to remember."

, To make the most of your decorations, make sure you have a lot of space to work with.

, These are the classic locker decoration and are a good way to show off who you’re friends with or currently dating. Consider hanging up pictures of friends and family or other pictures that you've taken, or make a photo collage out of magazine clippings, album covers, or photos you found online. Just don’t overfill your locker with pictures or your locker will get cluttered and won't look very good.


Postcards, nice shopping bags, or posters also make great wall hangings, but choose things that reflect your own unique personality.

, This is a great way to make sure you look good between classes – not to mention take a peek at whoever is behind you.

, Use it for reminders, such as writing down a test date or homework assignment. If you share a locker with someone you like, you can also use it to leave notes for each other.


If you don't have the space to hang up a bulletin board, think about sticking up cork coasters in a pretty formation and they'll act as mini bulletin boards.

, You can buy funny magnets that show off your personality, have custom photo magnets made, or even stick magnetic letters inside to write notes. The magnets can be purely decorative, but they’re also a great way to hang notes if you can’t fit a bulletin board inside.


You could also hang functional items such as a magnetic calculator or calendar.

, Simply place a wide-mouthed envelope or small, flat canister underneath the slots so that your friends can drop notes inside.

, It’s a good idea to test a marker in an inconspicuous corner to make sure it erases before going all out and professing your undying love to your crush all over the inside. If this works, keep dry-erase markers in a conspicuous place inside the locker (ex. tied to strings and hanging from magnets) so that you never confuse them with Sharpies.

, Make sure it’s small enough that you still have room left over for the rest of your stuff.

, Lockers don't get a lot of air circulation, so consider spraying your perfume/cologne inside or adding an air freshener. (Don’t limit your thinking to those paper fresheners you find in cars; a lot of stores sell miniature bottles of air freshener that come in lots of different scents.) As an added bonus, this will it help cover up the smell of that sandwich you left in there last week.

, Once you have your content arranged, go ahead and accentuate it. You can put in ribbon streamers, fabric pieces, etc., or you can even put in a thin wooden frame around your art.

, You can keep the same theme all year or you can redo parts of it or the whole thing from time to time. Consider making seasonal changes or decorating your locker for holidays or important events. Keep it interesting all year long. You might even make new friends, too!

, Now that you've spent all that time getting your locker just right, keep it in good condition. Clean it out regularly, and keep your books organized. Just opening and closing the door of your locker will eventually make things start to shift around, especially if you haven't hung them very securely, so periodically maintain your art to keep it looking great.

, This is super convenient for us, since we definitely would want to know where to go next. You can type out and personalize your schedule using Excel. Change the fonts and colors, etc. You can make it any size you want, for example, you can make it big enough so that it is as big as a frame, or you can make it small so it's cute and just like a reminder (if you want to put a lot of other stuff). Just make sure it's legible!

Lockers aren't exactly walk-in closets, so try to keep it organized. Never have a cluttered locker.

, Remove any unnecessary items before proceeding to the next phase (personalizing).

, Make sure you put things back where they belong. Even if you're rushed, try to take the time to put things in their correct spot. It won't help when you get to class and realize in your haste you grabbed your social studies binder instead of science.

, Make them cute so it represents your personality. You'll need hand sanitizer and band-aids, but not a whole first aid kit. If it is necessary for you, bring a small makeup bag. Always have a compact mirror in your locker.

, A sticker or picture will be nice to have. A colorful whiteboard or corkboard would be nice. Try to find the magnetic mini photo frames for lockers. They are available at office depot or office max usually.

, They are fun and easy to make, and don't cost a lot of money.

, Put your own magnets on the back of a mirror or buy a locker mirror at a store and put that on your locker door. You can get these locker mirrors at many ""big box"" office supply stores.

, This is an easy way to keep track of tests and write yourself notes. You can survey the board after every class period.

, These can be some that you drew, some that remind you of something great, or a combination of the two.

, This could be something like: The 70's, chocolate, Skittles, sparkly things, sports, racing, favorite colors, and so on. Maybe even puppies! However, this step is optional, as just colors or neatness make a nice look too.

Pack all the needed text books, notebooks and the homework for each subject in your backpack/purse. I prefer putting the books in order (e.g. if I have French and then Dutch I put French on top and right after that Dutch). This way you won't be the one looking for the books while everyone else is already working.;
, Check if the pencil case is zipped (so nothing will fall out) and put your planner in the bag. Your planner is important to note all your homework in. Try to keep your planner clean and organized.

, Try to have a healthy lunch, such as carrots, an apple or a sandwich with vegetables (e.g. lettuce, tomato, cucumber...) Carry a bottle of water with you. Also carry some money around, like in your shoe or bag.

, Pack your make-up kit, some deodorant and a hairbrush. You may put this in your locker (provided your school uses them).

Let him take responsibility.,
Leave a note.",How to Pack a School Bag for Boys," Think about what kind of bag you need. Do you want a backpack or a lunchbox? What material of bag do you want - cloth or tin? Square or oval shape? Zipper or button? Think about these little things and ask the boy what kind he would prefer and look for a bag that matches at least a few of these conditions.


Go with the boy and pick out what kind of bag he wants (Target, Walmart or Stop and Shop can have some quality bags), so he can choose himself.
Do you want a design on it? This is an important question to ask yourself, especially if you are tight on money and want to reuse the bag next year. Maybe he'll be sick of SpiderMan and will want Superman on his backpack instead.;
, Talk to the boy about what kind of things are important to him, and he wants to have in his bag. For example, his iPod Touch might be something that he really wants to have in his backpack, because he wants to play it with his friends at recess. Have him be honest with you, even though it may pain you to hear that he still wants his iPod Touch more than his library book you've been trying to get him to read.


Approve of his decisions. Be sure that you are okay with everything that he wants to have in his bag.
Talk about the important things that you need to have for curriculum or academical needs. He will need a snack for snack time, but will also need his folder for Math Class.
Consider what he will need. For example, you have to remember that on Mondays, you need to pack his baseball because he has sports after school. Think about what activities he has after school and plan accordingly.

, Pencils, pencil cases, books, folders, notebooks, etc. Be sure that those go in the backpack first. Make those more important then the iPod Touch.


Write his name. Maybe you don't need to write his name on each pencil, but be sure to have his name and class on each book, folder, and everything else, so you don't lose everything as much.

, Make sure you both know where supplies are going, this way each morning there isn't any screaming ""WHERE is my stupid pencil case!""


Label. Sometimes, it can be good to label where to put the keys, but if you think he is too old for that, don't bother.

, Agree that when he doesn't need his baseball, he puts it immediately in his desk.


Make a list of what he needs every day and where it is.

, One example is key chains, but don't add too many or they can become too jingly (unless you want to hear where he is all of the time).

, Avoid packing his backpack for him every day. Let him know that he has to take responsibility for his things. Once in a while, when he is busy, you may pack his bag for him. Usually, though, make sure he knows to take care of it.


You can make taking care of his school bag a chore if he has a problem doing it.

, Make a tradition of writing a little note, reminding him what he has after school, how's he's getting home or who's picking him up, or maybe just reminding him that you love him.


Sometimes, he may find this embarrassing. Try this a couple of times and see what happens.

Consider toner or blotting papers, moisturizer, foundation/concealer, powder, mascara, lip gloss. Also tote along lotion, ponytail holders, a hairbrush, and a straightener if desired. If you use hairspray or any other styling products, toss them in, also. DO NOT FORGET your deodorant, perfume, pads or tampons if necessary, pain-killers, or a towel. You might like to take two towels, one for your body and one for your hair if you take a shower after your pre-school sports practice.

, Depending on how much time you have before class starts to get ready, bring: An everyday bra, underwear, jeans or other bottoms, a cute tee, and possibly a sweatshirt or, your school uniform. Just be sure it's something basic if you have a choice, instead of a complicated outfit. You want to keep it as cute looking yet quick to put in as you can so you can spend more time on your hair and makeup if required.

Add the things you always seem to need.,

Test the system.,
Clean regularly!",How to Organize your School Bag (Girls)," Start by purchasing a good bag for school. Backpack styles are popular and usually the roomiest, most comfortable, and overall most efficient way of toting your things. Many girls, however, like the more feminine purse-style of a tote or messenger bag. Whatever you choose, make sure it's big enough to hold books, papers, folders, and the like without bursting at the seams. Also, look for bags with pockets. It's extremely hard to organize bags with only one or two compartments. You're best off looking for a bag with at least two pockets, one zippered. Preferably inexpensive, but expect to pay $20 minimum.;
, You're best off doing this on a hard, spacious area. Weed through your stuff and toss the obvious junk, like old tissues, pen caps, papers, and the like. Then, ask yourself what you really need and what just gets in the way. Assign your things quickly and easily. Maybe that hairbrush would be better put to use tucked inside your gym bag. Chances are good you don't need three extra folders and ten lip glosses in your bag, so pare down to only the things you really need and use often.

, Now is the ideal time to add to your pile the things you always seem to need but never have. Such items may include gum, tissues, hand lotion, or whatever else you seem to have to borrow from others often. You may want to include emergency supplies like pads and tampons, band-aids, a mirror, hair ties, bobby pins, etc. Avoid, however, adding useless things back to the pile that you eliminated in the last step.

, Take this moment to remove any dirt and crumbs from your bag. Clean thoroughly any spots and stains on the inside and outside to give yourself a clean slate.

, Now group the things you have left to keep in your bag together based on similarities. Categories like makeup, writing utensils, emergency supplies, hair or beauty items, school books and papers, electronics, etc. are good examples.

, Start by taking note of the number of separated spaces you have to work with, as well as where they are, and think about how each pocket or compartment is best put to use. Obviously, books and papers will go in the largest pocket, but what to do with all of those other little nooks and crannies? Break it down based on your groupings from before. Pens, pencils, and markers are best kept easily accessible. Emergency supplies or beauty products can be stashed in an inside pocket or in a small separate pouch. Electronics should be well protected, stashed separately from lotions, sprays, or any types of food in your bag. Follow the top organization rules; things you use the most often should be the easiest to access, things you use less often should be harder to reach. Also consider concealment issues; an inside pocket for feminine products may be best if you don't wish to draw attention to yourself, for example.

, Take a few days and see how everything works for you. Switch your placements around as needed. What you don't use in one week should be removed from your bag; likewise, add the things you realize are very important for your day to day life. Don't be afraid to switch things down the road either; changes in schedules or extracurricular activities can alter how you need to keep things organized.

, Clean out your bag at least once a month or whenever it starts to get a bit messy again. Try to avoid issues in the future by maintaining your setup; avoid throwing things in your bag at the last minute, and again, feel free to change your system when it starts to break down.

, If you don't have a PINK hoodie, just hang up a pink jacket. This shows you really do love PINK products, not just the style.

, If you can't afford PINK lotions/your parents won't let you buy them, skip this step. As stated above, it will show you're in love with pink and PINK.

, PINK is glamorous, and nothing says glamour like a mirror! I would suggest a vanity; one that looks like a dry erase board then opens to a mirror.

, Keep pictures of your stuffed animals too. This shows you're fun, slightly goofy, and can laugh at yourself (especially if you put up a pic of you making a hilarious face).

, Unless you already have a backpack/bag you really want to keep using. Or, just skip a backpack altogether and just bring a purse with your pencils and keep the rest in your locker.

, Put PINK quotes on them like ""LOVE PINK"" or ""Study Less Party More"" or ""VIVA PINK"" you get a lot more quotes off their hoodies at www.victoriassecret.com. Tape them in your locker and on your binders. Remember: glitter is your best friend!

, Buy pink folders, notebooks, and pens. Also, buy a pink binder. If it is too pink for you, just buy some red, like 2 pink folders, 1 red folder, 2 red notebooks, 1 pink notebook, 1 pink pen, 1 red pen, and 1 purple pen. Decorate your pencils with heart stickers.

, then, sprinkle the top with silver, black, gold, or pink glitter. Wait for it to dry then glue a magnet on the back. Tah-dah!

Plan out what to take in your bag.,
Use every part of your backpack.,
Watch the weight of your bag.,
Keep everything in your backpack current.,
Clean out your backpack regularly.",How to Organize Your Backpack for Middle School," Before you start organizing, you should check what items you already have and what condition they’re in. It’s likely you still have pens, markers, highlighters, and folders from your previous school year. You may even have extra loose leaf paper that you can reuse for the coming year.


You should also take this time to clean your backpack. You can either vacuum it out or simply turn it upside down over a trash can and shake it.
Make sure you also check the condition of your backpack. If you have any rips or tears, or if your backpack is small, you may want to buy a new one.;
, For example, sort textbooks, binders, notebooks, writing utensils, miscellaneous items, and trash into different piles. Then go through the piles and throw out what you don't need. You can get rid of any used notebook paper, stubs of pencils, empty pens, broken hairbands, or any other useless items you find.


This is also a good time to start a list of the items you have and of those that you still need. This will make shopping easier later, as you won't have to try and remember what to buy.

, If you have binders or folders, try organizing them with tabs and dividers. You can sort them by subject, chapter, or function. For example, label each folder with the new year’s classes, like Science, Social Studies, or English. You can also put all your pens, pencils, and highlighters into a pen case or bag. This way, you aren’t buying new items you don’t need.

, Before every school year, your school should provide you with a list of the items you need for your grade. If you don’t receive one of these before the school year begins, you can usually find them at supply stores like Office Max or Staples. The most common items for middle school include pens, #2 pencils, notebooks, wide-rule loose leaf paper, a 3 ring binder, and scissors and tape.Other materials you may need include a USB flash drive, a TI calculator, index cards, a weekly planner, and a stapler., You don’t want to overload your backpack, so try to take only the essentials when you can. For example, having one binder separated into multiple subjects will help save you space compared to multiple folders. You should also try to take two pencils and two to three pens, as well as a highlighter, and your weekly planner. This way, the rest of your space can be dedicated to textbooks and notebooks.


You’ll have a better idea of exactly what you’ll need day-to-day after the first week of class.
If you have money for lunch, try to keep it zipped up in an inside pocket. If you don't have one in your bag, try to keep it in a change purse or wallet instead. This will help keep your money safe and together, so you aren't searching all over for it during lunch time.
If you have a block schedule with different classes on different days, try separating your materials into marked piles. For example, you can mark everything for one day with a specific color like red, while the other day is blue. Then you can switch them out of your backpack when necessary., Now is the moment of truth; you want to make sure you can fit everything in your backpack and still be able to carry it. Chances are you’ll have a locker you can store some things in, but you still need to be able to take everything to and from school each day. Put your binder, notebooks, textbooks, and pencil case in the main part of the bag - in that order. You should then put any extra materials into the front pockets.


For example, your calculator, tape, stapler, even markers, and highlighters if they won’t fit in your pencil case can go in your front pockets.
The front pockets of your backpack are also a great place to keep items like chapstick, tissues, mints, or anything else you want to carry with you.

, It's important for both your comfort and health to make sure that your backpack doesn't get too heavy as the school year progresses. For example, if you're continuously adding assignments, projects, snacks, and additional school supplies, your bag is going to gain some weight. If you notice that it's difficult to lift your bag or that the straps cut into your shoulders, it's probably time to clean out and reorganize.


Your backpack shouldn't weigh more than 10-20% of your weight. For example, if you weigh 120 lbs, your backpack shouldn't weigh more than 12 lbs. , You don't want anything in your bag except what is absolutely necessary; your school books, writing utensils, and current assignments. This will not only help with the weight of your bag but also keep you organized. For example, you probably don't need to keep returned assignments, projects, or instructions for homework you've already completed. Though papers don't weigh a lot on their own, they can really add up when you're saving a bunch of them.


Instead, keep a binder or file folder at home for all returned papers. You can even organize it by subject. This way, if your teacher requests an older assignment, you'll know exactly where it is and how to find it.

, You don't have to do this every day, but you should try to clean out your bag every two weeks or every month. It's difficult to keep everything in place and organized when you are moving from class to class all day. You might start throwing your pens and pencils directly into your bag and shoving your papers into your books instead of your folders. To avoid this, try taking an hour or two at the end of the week, or every other week, and clean out your bag.


You should take everything out and go through it. Throw or file away unnecessary papers, trash, old food, and broken pens or pencils. Make sure assignments or papers are in the appropriate folders and organize them by date if you can.
You can also wash or vacuum out your bookbag at this time, too.

Put all your school items into your bag and check it over once more.",How to Organize Your School Bag," The size should be right for you and it is a good idea to try it before you buy it. If it's a backpack, try it on and check the comfort level. If it's a carrying style of bag, carry it around and get a feel for the handle, weight, and balance of the bag. Ask the retailer if it's okay to stuff the bag for trying it so that you get an idea of what it feels like when full (just use items from the back-to-school section to fill it, or stuff in a few other bags from nearby). Walk around a bit and see how the bag performs for you.


Check the stitching or seals. Does the bag look like it can last the next year or does it look like it's about to fall apart with the first fill of books and clothes?;
, Remove all the contents and give the bag a wipe down inside and out. If it is machine washable, give it a spin and air dry. If not, wiping and vacuuming should do the trick. Start with an empty, clean bag.


Take everything out of your school bag, even if you know that you need it. Make sure all of your pockets are empty too.
Make sure all the rubbish such as used tissues, rubbish wrappers, etc., is put in the bin.

, Put your existing items into to two piles, one for things you need and the things that you want. This will help you decide what is essential for school and what's just a preference. Even though some things may not be essential, they may make your studies more enjoyable, so you'll want to make room for them. Also, put aside things that are no longer useful, such as a grubby eraser or dog-eared exercise books with filled pages.

, The typical things to keep in your school bag include:


Books (both exercise/workbooks and texts, as required each day)
Diary
Folders
Two-pocketed pencil case - pencils, pens, ruler, eraser, highlighter, colored pencils, marker(s), sticky notes, tape, scissors, glue, pencil sharpener, compass, protractor, etc. The two-pocketed pencil case for school keeps all of your things in order without being too small.
Calculator (preferably in a cover)
Flashdrive (USB stick)
Lunchbox (with daily lunch essentials, such as your water bottle)
Transport money/ticket/pass
ID card
Cellphone (if relevant)
House key
Tissues, medical needs
Emergency money
Personal items you feel you need for body care (hand sanitizer, sanitary ware, lip balm, etc.).

, It is a good idea to have a locker for sports gear so that you don't have to carry it daily, but do remember to bring it home regularly for washing and return it when ready again. In some cases, you may need to carry an extra bag for sports gear or special activities such as playing a musical instrument, doing art or participating in a club.

, Organize your books in the order. This way, you won't be looking for books while your classmates are working. You will feel much more organized as you pull the books out where you expect them to be.

, Folders are an essential for neatness. You can keep your assignments and assessments, homework, important notices and basically anything important in this folder.


Have three separate folders―one to keep for school (this folder), another to keep your assignment/test grades in, and another to use for old drafts for schoolwork.

, For example, keep your books in one area, your pencil case and related items in another section and your lunch in another. Place items such as your cell phone, money, ID card, house key, etc. in the pockets of the bag. Get used to distinct parts of your bag containing the same items, so that you know where to reach instinctively, even without looking.

, Last of all put in your lunch, a bottle of water and a pack of chewing gum and mints (if using).

,How to Pack a Backpack1,
"
Choose your backpack.,
Get your clothes ready.,
Organize smaller items.,
Separate out your food.,
Layer up your bag.,
Fill all the empty spaces.",How to Pack a Backpack2," With dozens of backpacks on the market these days, it may be difficult to select the best one for your life and travel commitments. Backpack sizes are measured in the number of liters they can carry, and range from 20-80+ liters each. Consider the length of your trip(s), your torso size, and the conditions under which you are backpacking. Whenever possible, choose a smaller and therefore lighter pack to make traveling more comfortable.


If you plan on being gone only a few days, select a backpack that is 50 liters (13.2 US gal) or lighter. This will help you to pack only things that are necessary, as well as limit the weight you have to carry.
Measure the length of your torso and find a backpack that matches. If your torso is 15–17 inches (38.1–43.2 cm) long, you’ll need a small backpack. If your torso is 17–18 inches (43.2–45.7 cm) long, a medium backpack will work fine. For a torso longer than 18 inches (45.7 cm), you will need a large or extra tall backpack., The length of your trip and the weather you’re dealing with will determine the amount of clothes you need. Of course, keeping your back as light as possible is the goal to have in mind, so nix any clothing that isn’t absolutely necessary. Lay your clothes out flat and then roll them up for the most efficient use of space. Separate out clothes that you might need during the day (such as a jacket) from the rest of your clothes.

, One of the most frustrating things about packing a backpack is losing track of small items near the bottom of your pack or under layers of other things. Separate out smaller items and place each category of items into different colored cloth or plastic bags. For example, place all your underwear in a red bag, all your socks in a blue bag, all your toiletries in a green bag, and miscellaneous items in a yellow bag. , If you’re backpacking through a city (like a trip through Europe) you might not need to pack so much food. If, however, you are taking a hiking trip and are camping in the woods, all your food stuffs will need to be packed with you. Keep these separate from the rest of your items, and place in a bag. If you are hiking you may also need to use bear canisters to keep bears and other animals away from your meals.


Keep snacks for hiking and walking around separate, as you will want to place these in easy reach.

, The order in which you place things in your bag is very important: put the things you use the least near the bottom, and keep the heaviest things in the center of the bag. For example, put your sleeping bag or clothing at the bottom of your bag since they are light and you won’t need them right away. Your tent, food, and water are typically the heaviest, and should be kept in the middle of the bag near your back to maintain your center of gravity. Surround these heavy objects with other soft or light items to increase your comfort.


Any fragile items (like a camera) should be placed in the center of your bag and surrounded by other smaller, lighter, and softer items. You can choose to wrap them in clothing as well.
Things that you need easy access to (such as snacks or a jacket) should be placed on the very top of all your things.
Stiff items such as tent poles or water bottles can be slipped into side pockets and under the compression straps on the outside of your bag.

, To maximize your total space and fit everything you need into your bag, fill up all available empty spaces. Use all the pockets you are given instead of cramming everything into the central compartment. Anything concave in shape (such as cups or bowls) can be filled with other smaller items. Layer things so that there aren’t large gaps between items that would allow shifting in your bag."

Sort through your items and decide what you absolutely need to take to class, keeping in mind that the total weight of your backpack should not exceed 15% of your total body weight. Separate notebooks, textbooks, and pens and pencils into individual piles., School backpacks always seem to have bits of ephemera floating around their pockets and main compartments. Instead of letting these miscellaneous items get out of control, organize them into individual bags. Keep pencils, pens, and markers together in a pencil pouch. Toiletry items such as hand sanitizer, tissues, or chapstick can placed in another separate bag to be tossed into the backpack.

, Order your items in “heaviest” to “least heavy” and place these in your backpack working from the back out. Typically the order will start with textbooks, then notebooks or binders, then smaller personal books, and pencil pouches last.

, Keep anything that might need to be grabbed quickly in the outer pockets, such as pencils or a cell phone. Add liquids or items that might be wet, such as water bottles or a wet umbrella, to the outer pockets as well. Toss your sweatshirt or jacket in the top, and you’re set!, Because your backpack is going into use on a daily basis, old papers and other useless bits pile up quickly. Once every 1-2 weeks, pull out and recycle any unnecessary papers from your bag. Doing this will keep your backpack light and organized.

Following the instructions on the back of the package, you can spell your name or add a cool and funky design to make your backpack your own.;
, You might like key chains dangling off your zips (a quite common idea, but never out of style), or you may like neat badges or brooches pinned on to the fabric.


Choose keychains that show places you've visited.
Find badges based on your favorite cartoons, shows, bands, or just something you think is cute.

, Some paints and pen marks will come out when you wash the backpack. Use one or several of the following materials, and be sure to draw only on the cloth part of the bag:


Fabric paint, purchased online or from a craft store
Colored permanent markers or fabric markers. Make sure the marker is dark enough that you can see it on a backpack.
If you can find stencils at your local craft store, then you can apply a cool design with the fabric paint, or even glitter glue! Make your own stencil for a unique design.

, You can buy decorative duct tape with all kinds of patterns from craft stores or school supply stores. Wrap it around the handles, cover the whole bag in stripes, or criss-cross strips of tape to make patterns.


Try combining different thicknesses and patterns for visual interest.
You can cut out hearts, stars, flowers or alphabet letters from the tape.
Foam tape works as well.

, Buttons can make your backpack a little trip to you-heaven. You can purchase large bags of buttons at thrift stores and craft stores. Attach them to the backpack with needle and thread or hot glue.


You can make your own buttons by decorating plastic objects and super-gluing safety pins to the back.

, Make a ribbon bow and sew it onto your book bag. Ask a parent or a friend to help if you don't know how to sew.

, Try adding some stick-on eyes, a stick-on nose and a stick-on mouth. Find these and other sturdy, stick-on objects at toy stores, craft stores, and novelty stores.

, Use embroidery floss to make braids and other string attachments that you can hang from zippers or buttons. There are many styles and patterns to explore, including like square knots, loom knits, and fishtail braids.

, You can tie pieces of cloth to your zipper tabs; you can emblazon this cloth with prayers, quotes, and any other words or images that you feel represent you. These are individual to you and are very easy to make. Find an old towel or sheet and cut it into strips that are big enough to write on. If the sheet isn't yours, make sure to ask permission.


Try using men's ties. You can find racks of colorful used ties at many thrift stores, or you can ask your dad for an old tie that he never wears. Glue the ties onto the sides of your backpack, tie them onto the straps, or cut up the fabric to arrange a unique pattern.

, Are you a glam-girl or an edgy rocker? If you have some rhinestones or studs, you can easily apply them to a backpack with fabric glue or hot glue. Be careful when handling hot glue--it can scald your fingers and stick to the skin!

, People will be amazed when you open your backpack to get something, and suddenly all your favorite TV characters and animals pop out at you. You will need to cut out and decorate pieces of paper, fold them, and tape them to the inside of your backpack.

, To make them more permanent, laminate them or cover both sides in clear tape. Attach them with strong tape or glue. You can also punch a hole in the photo (with scissors, a needle, or a hole-punch) and use a key-ring to attach the picture to a zipper.

, First, check out your backpack’s color. If it's a solid color, your job is easier. But if it has a pattern that has many overlapping colors, choose the color used most. Choose decorating colors that complement this color.


For example,if your bag is a light yellow, you might want to go with colors of the warm color scheme. If your bag is blue, choose a cool color scheme.
If your bag fabric has a dark shade, use light colors for contrast.

, If you have an artistic mind, pick fabric paint or another decorating option that lets you display your creativity. Here are a few ideas:


Abstract patterns make your backpack look unique.
Pick your favorite cartoon and draw the character from this cartoon.
Draw animated faces for a silly look.
For plain, simple backpacks, cover the entire pack surface with a pattern. Consider zebra stripes, cheetah spots, or smiley faces.

, Make your name and initials part of the design. Learn how to draw graffiti-style letters, or sew on fabric letters in different colors. This way, everyone will know that it's your backpack.

, Use a fabric marker to draw a bottom lip on one side of the opening and a front lip on the other. The zippers should look like teeth. Make your backpack look like it's talking by opening and closing the flaps. Add teeth, eyes, or a mustache if you like.

, You can write inspirational quotes, draw pictures of your pet, or even copy your favorite sheet music. Show your personality and interests with symbols from clubs, teams, or groups that you're a part of. For example, if you are an actor, you can draw theater masks.

Start with blank bag with little to no decoration.,
Decide what you want your schoolbag to look like.,
Collect or purchase all necessary supplies before you begin.,
Think of your schoolbag as an empty canvas.",How to Decorate a Schoolbag1," Find or buy a schoolbag that has little or no design. Having a blank canvas will make the process of decorating easier and more fun!


If you are planning on drawing or tie-dying your bag, you want a lighter background (e.g. white, cream, or light blue). Added colors will not show up on a dark background.
Dark colors such as navy or black are better background colors if you are adding things like patches, beads, glitter, or other appliques.;
, Do you want something fun and colorful? Fashionable? Or something unique that reflects your personality and interests? Before you begin decorating, think about the type of message you want to convey., Make a list of everything you need to complete your project, this will save you time and prevent stress down the road.. Look around your house or apartment for supplies, or make a trip to a craft or fabric store.


Read any instructions carefully before starting any type of DIY or craft project.
Do not be afraid to ask for help if needed, especially if you are inexperienced using a sewing machine, fabric dyes, or an exacto knife.

, The easiest way to customize a schoolbag is by using fabric pens or sharpies to draw anything from abstract designs to people, animals, or landscapes. Lay your bag on a hard surface and place a piece of cardboard under the fabric to provide a flat surface to draw-on, and prevent colors from soaking through.


Purchase fabric pens or markers from a craft store. These come in different tip sizes, and the ink is designed to adhere to fabric. Regular permanent markers may fade or run overtime.Iron over the decorated area on a medium setting to help the colors to set.Remember you can't undo or erase your drawings. Make a sketch first on a piece of paper, and practice drawing with fabric markers on old jeans or a t-shirt before using them on your schoolbag.

Find fun appliques at fabric or craft stores.,
Look online or in local music stores for custom fabric patches.,
Apply iron on fabric or embroidered patches.,
Use a sewing machine to attach fabric or embroidered patches.,
Hand sew fabric or embroidered patches.,
Embroider your schoolbag with beads or sequins.,
Add some glitz and glimmer with rhinestones or crystals.,
Create an edgy look with studs.",How to Decorate a Schoolbag2," Common examples of appliques include fabric patches, rhinestones, embroidery letters, or any other small decoration that can be ironed or sewed onto fabric.

, Fabric patches are a great way to use your schoolbag to express your personality. Consider adding patches from your favorite bands, or from places you have traveled to. If you don't sew, most patches can be applied by ironing them on or using fabric glue.

, Many fabric patches can be attached using an iron or with fabric craft glue. While these methods are not as secure as sewing, they are much easier and less time-consuming.Simply place the patch in the desired location on the bag and cover with a thin cloth.


Make sure the iron is turned on and set to ""dry"" (not steam) at low to mid heat.Slowly press down on the patch with the iron in an up and down motion (do not move back and forth) for 30 to 40 seconds. Make sure pressure is applied firmly and evenly. Finally, turn the school bag inside out and iron the opposite side for 20 to 30 seconds to reinforce the patch.Once the patch has cooled, slide your finger around the edges to make sure it is secure. Repeat ironing if needed.

, Sewn on patches are usually more secure and less likely to fall off in the wash than ones that are ironed or glued on.Place the patch in desired location. Use a safety pin or straight pin to hold in place.Alternatively, you can secure the patch before sewing by using a brush to apply a thin, even coat of fabric craft glue to the back. Place patch in desired location and smooth out edges. Allow to dry for at least 1 hour before sewing.Once the patch is secured, set machine to make a tight stitch and sew around the periphery. If possible, use a multi-stitch zig zag setting to create a strong, tight stitch., If you do not have access to, or do not know how to use a sewing machine, you can sew on patches by hand. All you need is a needle, some thread, and a straight pin or fabric glue. This may be more time consuming and your stitches will not be as even, but it is just as effective. Start as you would for a sewing machine, by securing the patch in the desired location with straight pins or for added security, fabric glue.


Cut a piece of thread that is no longer than 18 inches. Thread a needle and knot at one end. Start by placing the needle through the underlying fabric and pushing it through the patch. This will ensure the ends of the thread are hidden and not stick out from the patch. Stick the needle back through the patch and underlying fabric so it catches the edge of the patch. Pull the needle back through the fabric so the stitches are set not more than 1/4 inch apart.Repeat, stitching along the perimeter until the entire patch is sew on. Re-thread the needle as needed.
When finished, knot the thread and pull needle through patch and fabric. Cut ends of thread and tuck under patch.

, You can embellish your schoolbag using beadwork to form your initials, create sparkly floral motifs, or abstract designs.Beading requires fewer stitches than embroidering with thread or wool, and beads can be attached using almost any stitch.


Draw a design or letters with chalk, or purchase a beadwork pattern from a craft or fabric store.
Use a beading needle (these tend to be leaner and have smaller eyes than regular sewing needles) and select a size (10 to 15) based on your bead size.Thread the needle and tie a knot at one end of your string.Place needle underneath fabric and push through. Slide bead over needle and pull down length of thread until at fabric level. Push needle back through fabric alongside (not through center) of bead. Repeat 3 to 4 times so bead is secure before moving on to next bead.When finished or need to re-thread, tie several knots in the thread on the inside of the schoolbag and tuck under adjacent threads. This will keep the knots hidden, and prevent ends from fraying., Purchase flat back plastic rhinestones or crystals and fabric craft glue from a craft or fabric store. Make sure you have enough rhinestones by sketching your design on a piece of paper. Use this as a template to place (do not glue) rhinestones in desired pattern, such as a sunburst or star.Sketch your pattern in chalk on your schoolbag. This way, you can wipe it off with water if you make a mistake.
Glue the rhinestones on one at a time. If necessary, use tweezers to pick-up rhinestones. Use a toothpick to place a small drop of glue on the bottom of the stone and gently press it onto the fabric. Once all stones are glued on, let sit for 24 hours. While the glue should stabilize in about 1 hour, it takes an entire day to fully dry.Simply re-glue any stones that fall off.

, Studs come in a variety of shapes and sizes, including flat squares or spikes and are easy to attach to most schoolbags, even ones made from leather. You will need an exacto knife, small pliers, and studs purchased from a craft store. Determine where you want to place the studs. Use the exacto knife to poke two small holes. Insert your stud through the holes and using the pliers, bend the two prongs down until secure."

Create a custom design with duct tape.,
Add some sparkle with glitter.,
Use stencils and fabric paint to create a custom graphic design.,
Tie-Dye a nylon schoolbag.",How to Decorate a Schoolbag3," Duct tape comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns and can be ordered online or purchased from most craft or hardware stores. This method works especially well on messenger-style schoolbags since they provide a flat surface for easy application. Purchase different colored rolls of duct tape. Use scissors to cut strips that vary in length and/or thickness and simply stick to your bag. You can create a collage or geometric design.Decorate a small section or cover your entire schoolbag.
Alternate horizontal and vertical strips to create a checkerboard pattern, or alternate diagonal strips to make a chevron design.
Cut-out shapes (triangles, circles, squares, etc.) by placing tape stick-side down on a self healing mat. Use a ruler and precision cutting tool, such as an exacto knife, to cut shapes. Gently lift off of mat using the tip of the blade and use your fingers to press evenly and firmly onto your schoolbag., You can use metallic (e.g. gold, silver, or copper) or colored glitter to add sparkly embellishments or designs to a plain schoolbag. You will need glitter (any color), a paintbrush, painter's tape, fabric glue, and newspaper. Use the painter's tape to tape-off the section of bag you want to add glitter to. This will help create clean, straight edges. Spread a thin, even layer of fabric glue over the taped-off area using the paintbrush. Pour glitter on glue and press gently so it adheres to the fabric. Shake-off excess glitter onto a newspaper for reuse. Add more glitter until you had a solid layer.Let dry for several hours before removing tape.
Glitter can get messy, so it might be better to do this outside or over a drop cloth or newspapers. This will make it easier to clean-up when you are done.
If you need to wash your schoolbag, hand wash it separately in a sink and let air dry. Placing it in a washing machine may cause the glitter to fall off and stick to other clothes.

, You can make your own stencils or buy them from a craft store. Simply position the stencil in the desired location and use a sponge brush to press (do not brush or glob) paint onto the fabric in the open areas of the stencil.For detail work, use a small paintbrush to dab on paint. Let air dry. Apply another coat of paint if needed.


Make your own stencil by drawing a design on cardstock or freezer paper. Use a marker to color in the areas that you want to cut out. Place the paper with your design on top of cardboard and carefully use an exacto knife to cut out the colored-in sections.
Freezer paper works well for making stencils to use on fabric because it has a regular and glossy side. You can use a hot iron to fuse the glossy side to the fabric. When the paint is dry, you can simply peel off the stencil., If you can't find the color schoolbag you want, or want to create a tie-dye effect, consider doing-it-yourself instead of spending money on a bag you don't want. You will need to start with a light colored bag, preferably cream or white as dark colors will mask the dye. You will need acid dye, rubber bands, a stove, thermometer, and a metal pot. Purchase acid dye from a craft or fabric store and read the instructions on the bottle before beginning. Begin by twisting and bunching-up sections of your school bag and securing with rubber bands.Fill an old pot you no longer use for cooking food with enough water to cover the schoolbag but still allow it to move freely. Stir in dye (2/3 ounce of dye per 1 pound of fabric).Add schoolbag to water with dye. Heat water to 185 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit and let simmer for ten minutes. Add vinegar (1/4 cup vinegar per 1 pound of fabric). Maintain temperature and stir frequently for about 30 minutes. Turn-off burner and allow water and fabric to cool gradually. Remove schoolbag and wash in warm water with synthrapol or a professional textile detergent.
Rinse schoolbag in cold water several times, or until water runs clear, to remove excess dye. Place in dryer on a ""hot"" setting to set the dye.Check the manufacturer's tag on your schoolbag to see what type of fabric it is made out of. If the schoolbag is nylon with a waterproof coating such as Gore-Tex, then you will not be able to dye it (the waterproofing will prevent any water and therefore dye from soaking into the fabric)."
"
Add key-chains.,
Collect buttons that reflect your personality and interests.,
Decorate several schoolbags using different techniques.",How to Decorate a Schoolbag4," Like fabric patches, key-chains are a great way to express yourself. Popular themes include souvenir key-chains from your travels, favorite cartoon characters, and plush toys.


You can buy mini sharpie marker key-chains. Hang these on your schoolbag so you and your friends can sign you name or draw designs at any time.

, Collect buttons from concerts, charity events, or as souvenirs. Buttons are available in an infinite array of designs, images, or sayings. Shop around and find buttons that fit your style and taste.


Look online for buttons from foreign countries or foreign sport teams.
Keep a collection at home and change them up frequently to keep things interesting. Avoid anything with profanity or nudity, especially when at school.
Always unpin any buttons prior to washing.

, Consider redecorating an old schoolbag instead of spending money on a new one, or purchase several plain schoolbags and decorate them using different color schemes, designs, and/or techniques. You can also coordinate your schoolbag's colors and designs to match a favorite outfit. Additionally, you can apply these methods to decorating other types of bags, such as totes, purses, or drawstring bags.

Consider your needs.,
Weigh the positive attributes and the negative when selecting a bag.,
Consider all of the pros you want in your bag as well as attributes that might actually be unnecessary - and do this before going shopping.,
Get a bag that is large enough to hold all your things.,
Figure out how durable you want your bag to be.,
Get a bag from a reputable brand.,
Don't just choose a bag that is just good, sturdy and big enough, it has to be appealing or you won't like wearing it.",How to Choose a School Bag," Take a look at your school's supply list (if they provide you one) and its policies on bags, the textbooks you will be receiving from your school, and whether you'll be using a laptop (mostly in late high school). These factors affect the type and size of the bag you will need.


First of all, see what your school's rules or handbook have to say about backpacks. Certain schools do not allow rolling backpacks or messenger bags, for example, and some have specifications with regards to style or color.
If you have back problems or other medical needs, make sure that the type of bag you're considering getting will not cause you more trouble. Messenger bags, tote bags or other bags carried on only one shoulder may be poor choices in this situation.
If you will be transporting a laptop to school, record its measurements, so you can narrow down your choices of bags to ones that have a laptop pocket and ones which have the perfectly sized pocket for your mini-computer.;
, Here are negative examples:


""The bag I want to buy can't hold all my stuff!""
""My school/parents won't allow it.""
""The bag is too expensive.""
""People have been saying that it isn't durable.""
""Everyone has one.""
""The bag is not eye-catching.""
""It isn't waterproof.""
""I don't like the style!"".

, This will make your decision less stressful!


Other than your school supplies, what else might you carry? Middle and high school students might want to bring a makeup kit, a phone, an iPod, or projects, among other things. So, decide what goes into your bag before getting one. These things make a difference (some bags provide a device pocket in which you can carry your portable devices and listen to music).

, Preferably look for a bag that has sufficient pockets, dividers, zipper compartments, etc., that will allow you to put everything inside in an organized manner.


Multiple pouches of varying sizes is a good idea. Little compartments are great, to hold all your personal things, especially if you carry your backpack around all day.
Water bottle holders may be helpful if you carry a water bottle.
If you bring a lunch every day, you might like to have a separate compartment in which you can put food to prevent spills.

, Durability is a huge factor when purchasing a bag. It may cost more money but not having to replace it, will save money in the long run. If you're looking for maximum durability, a bag made out of nylon or canvas might be necessary, and depending on where you purchase your bag, you may pay handsomely for that. Conversely, if you want to be able to replace your bag year after year, extreme durability might not be of such concern.


However, if your bag will be used to carry sports equipment or will be taken on camping or hiking excursions, you would be well advised to go for something that is reasonably durable.
Look for replacement warranties for the bag. Quality brands will provide this reassurance.

, You don't have to spend a lot of money, but it's always helpful to know something about who made your bag. Also, should you need help with your bag, a trusted company is always more helpful.

, Your backpack is as important as your clothes, if not more so because you wear the same bag every day! Get one that you like now and will for a while.

Decide to buy online or in person.,
Choose a store.,
Try on backpacks in person.",How to Choose a Backpack for School," Determine what size objects and how much weight you will carry to school. Also think about what sorts of pockets you will need. College students will have different needs from those of first-graders. Some things to keep in mind include:


Do you need a compartment for your computer?
Do you need a place to put your lunch?
Do you need places to put pens, keys, or other small objects?
Do you want water bottle holders or mobile phone pockets?
How many binders, notebooks, and books will you need to carry at once?;
, The fabric a backpack is made of will determine its weight, breathability, and durability.


New synthetic fabrics will last longest, but leather ages with more character.
Synthetic fabrics are lighter-weight than leather. If you choose a leather bag it will be much heavier even before you begin to load it.Synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon are more water-resistant than natural fibers like cotton.Natural fibers like hemp are more environmentally sustainable than synthetics. If you care about having an eco-friendly bag choose a natural fiber., Look closely at the closures for the pockets and make sure they are sturdy and easy to close.


Choose double-headed zippers for easiest access.
Look for heavy-duty zippers that will hold up over time.

, Style is an important feature of a school backpack. You will want a bag that looks good and is also similar to backpacks that are currently in style.


Prints are fashionable right now, but consider solid colors too because you will wear the bag every day and it has to match a lot of outfits.About half of the backpacks sold by one of the biggest companies, Jansport, are black.If you want a sleek, timeless bag that will fit in with the crowd you can't go wrong with a black backpack.
Try an eco-friendly bag. Backpacks made from recycled or sustainable materials are very trendy., Think about how much padding you will need in order to carry the weight in your bag comfortably and safely.


Choose a bag with wide, padded straps to properly support weight on your shoulders.

, The straps should be adjustable so that you make the bag sit firmly against the strongest part of your back. If the bag sways around or sits too low on your back it can cause back pain and spine problems, especially if it is very heavy.According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, a child's backpack should sit about two inches above the waist., Pick a bag with two shoulder straps. Using only one strap can cause alignment problems for your back and spine or shoulder and neck injuries., If you plan to carry very heavy loads regularly you may want a strap the clips over your waist to distribute the weight more.

, Some backpacks have padding on the back to add additional comfort., A bag with two straps instead of one will offer more even weight distribution and be better for your back, but messenger style bags with one strap might look more fashionable.Decide which advantage is more important to you.

, The classic backpack has a full zipper that goes all the way around from near the base on one side, over the top, to near the base on the other side. Other backpacks open only at the top and may include a flap that folds over as a closure instead of a zipper.


Full-zipper bags allow for easy insertion and extraction of large items or a lot of items at once.
Top loading bags may give a little extra space because the top flap can be fastened over large or protruding items such as a jacket.

, In recent years backpacks with wheels that can be pulled instead of carried have become more popular. These can be a good option for carrying heavy loads.


Keep in mind that a wheeled bag will be much heavier even before it is loaded because of the added frame, handle, and wheels. If the bag is for a child, make sure they can lift it: when you do have to pick it up it will weigh more than a regular bag.Wheeled bags can be more difficult to move around in crowded areas such as a busy hallway between classes.
Wheeled bags are great for carrying very heavy items like lots of textbooks that you don't want to lift and wear on your back.
Some schools have rules about wheeled bags and some schools do not allow them so check before buying.

, There are some advantages to buying online but finding a bag in person can give you a better feel for what you are getting


Buying online may offer you more choices and a lower price.
Shopping in person will enable you to try on the backpack, make sure it fits well, and examine the inside of the bag to see additional features.

, Backpacks are available at a variety of retailers. Big sellers may offer a lower price but specialty stores have more expertise. Consider these kinds of retailers:


Online vendors like Amazon, these have a large selection and low prices.
Online shoe sellers like Zappos carry bags and sometimes offer free shipping and allow you to try on products and return them for free if they don't fit well.
Big box stores. Stores like Walmart or Target sell backpacks in physical stores and online.
Sporting goods stores. Stores that sell sports equipment usually sell a lot of backpacks.
Luggage stores. Retailers that specialize in luggage are a great place to find backpacks.
Specialty bag makers. Some companies, like Jansport focus on backpacks. You can buy directly from these companies online or find their bags in stores that carry backpacks.
Outdoors stores and backpacking stores. Retailers like L.L. Bean or North Face that focus on outdoor goods stock backpacks and they often have specialized salespeople who can help you select a bag and instruct you about proper fit.

, It may be tempting to order a backpack online but it is best to try them on in person to make sure they fit and to see other features.


Try on the bag you want to buy to make sure it feels comfortable and can be adjusted to fit well.
When viewing bags in person, open the bag to look at inside pockets and features. Often these are not visible in photos on online shopping sites.

Clean your bag out weekly.",How to Avoid a Heavy Backpack," While some bags may be unnecessarily overpriced, you will find that good quality backpacks with more features and strong materials will cost you a bit more. You’ll want to choose quality here, because the longer the bag stays in good shape, the more of a routine you can build around it. Look at canvas bags with reinforced seams costing around the $40.00 range., While you may think that backpacks are one size fits all, know that there are several factors that will make the bag fit better to your frame. You’ll have to pay attention to the shoulder straps and the center of gravity.Make sure the bag has two, wide straps. There are some backpacks that double as shoulder bags: while stylish, they won’t be very good for carrying heavy weight as they’ll put more weight on one side of your spine. Two wide straps will distribute the weight of the bag evenly to both your shoulders, while narrow straps will dig in and cause pain.
Make sure the straps rest comfortably on your shoulders, and aren’t too wide or too close together. Too close together, and the straps may feel tight and constricting while resting too close to your neck. Too far apart and they may tend to slip off your shoulders.
Check the center of gravity. The heaviest of your books and belongings will rest at the very bottom of the bag, so you want to make sure that that center of weight isn’t too low. The bottom of the backpack should rest at your hip line, or right about the height where you’d wear a belt.

, While your first thought may be to buy the roomiest backpack so you can fit more inside, think about buying a smaller bag. The smaller it is, the less you’ll be tempted to overload it., While they might not be considered to be very cool, a rolling backpack can be loaded with a more weight than a carried backpack and can prevent injury too. If you think that you’re going to be carrying a lot of heavy books, look into rolling backpacks or briefcases. Make sure they’re allowed at your school though, as some schools consider them tripping hazards., You’ll want to make sure that the empty bag you’re buying isn’t too heavy by itself. While most are made from light materials like nylon or canvas, some may be heavy while empty. Pick up the bag and get a feel for what it feels like empty to make sure you’re not buying too heavy of a bag., Whether you’ve bought it brand new or you need to unpack everything inside, making your bag lighter often starts with removing everything and deciding what you really need. Take out and set aside any old work or garbage, and look through your books and other belongings to see what is truly necessary., One piece of paper is light, but thirty or forty pieces of paper are deceptively heavy. Old work piles up, whether it’s kept in neatly in folders or just thrown in the back of your bag. Go through the papers and decide what you still need. File or save any old homework or tests that you’ll need in the future, then throw the rest away., Receipts, fliers and other garbage tends to accumulate throughout a backpack over time. It gets stuffed in between important things and forgotten, adding to the weight of the bag over time. Go through your bag and remove any unnecessary clutter, throwing it away if it’s truly unnecessary.

, You may have been carrying around old library books or project binders that you completely forgot about. These add a lot of weight to your bag that you don’t really need. Try to take out books as soon as you’re finished with them or no longer need them for class to help keep your bag’s weight down.

, Carrying a week (or a month's) worth of supplies can add weight and make your bag extra heavy. Think about what you actually use on a daily basis: how much paper, how many pens, how much makeup, what kind of gym supplies. Remove extra or excess amounts of these items.

, You’ll want your heaviest items, like textbooks, packed closer to your spine. The further out you pack them, the more they’ll pull your spine in that direction, causing bad posture or even injury., The more you can distribute the weight throughout your backpack, the lighter your bag will seem. Since the weight won’t just be resting in one spot, your body will be carrying the load more evenly. Try to utilize all of the compartments and zipped pouches, especially those on the sides and near your shoulders.

, If you’ve gone through your bag and removed all of the clutter, you’ll likely have gotten rid of books or items you don’t need. To tell if an item is unnecessary, think about whether you use it frequently or at all. If you use it daily, keep it in the bag. If you haven't seen it in weeks, take it out.


Make decluttering a habit! If you know you won’t need something, leave it out of your bag. Go through your bag weekly to make sure you haven't piled up more of the same old things.

, If there are certain things that you know you won’t need at home, leave them in your locker. This includes extra notebooks, textbooks for classes without homework that night, sports supplies, etc., Go through your class schedule and see exactly what you will need to take with you for the next day. This will ensure that you’re not carrying unnecessary books, notebooks or supplies. Here, unnecessary supplies are ones that you won't specifically need tomorrow. If you have Algebra, History and Spanish, leave out your English and Biology notebooks and texts., While big binders and multiple-subject notebooks are great for organization, they also add a lot of weight, especially when they contain notes for classes you don't need every day. Invest in supplies that will help you separate your carry load and lighten your pack.


Get separate notebooks for each class. If you have one small notebook for each subject or project, you'll be able to carry only what you need for each day, leaving behind the notebooks you definitely won't need. Get notebooks in different colors if you have a hard time keeping them all straight.
Invest in compact notebooks. A4 is the standard paper size for most notebooks, but it includes a lot of margin room. All of that extra space on the paper adds up in weight, and you may not even get to the end of the notebook! Look at smaller A5 or even A6 notepads to cut down on the size and weight of your notebooks.Carry travel sized items. If you frequently carry hairspray, lotion or other grooming products for use after gym, buy smaller sizes. Liquids weigh a lot and that weight adds up. If your favorite products don't come in travel sizes, buy small plastic bottles and transfer your products into them. Try sites like Amazon or The Container Store for small bottles., The less papers and books you have to carry, the lighter your backpack will be. Some textbooks come in electronic format, and you may be able to scan your homework and turn it in online. Also, consider scanning your book chapters and keeping them in digital form if an eBook is not available with the bound edition.This way, you’ll only have to carry a laptop or tablet instead of books and papers., While it may be hard to remember to do this, giving your parents any notes or letters means less weight in your backpack. Letters and notices tend to pile up especially if you’re forgetful about them.

, The sooner you do homework, the less likely it is to get lost or be forgotten in your bag, turning into dead weight. Also, when you finish the homework, you’ll no longer have to carry the corresponding textbook to and from school, saving your bag 20 or 30 pounds.

, Going through your bag weekly will help cut down on the clutter and the weight of the bag. It will also give you a good time to re-organize things back into the pockets they belong in, keeping the distribution of weight correct.

Look for a backpack with wide, padded shoulder straps.,
Choose a backpack with a padded back.,
Opt for a backpack that is lightweight but durable.,
Go for a backpack that is tall instead of wide.,
Consider the size of the backpack.,
Make sure the backpack can be easily cleaned.,
Buy your toddler's backpack in person rather than ordering it online.,
Choose a backpack that your child loves.,
Ensure that your child uses both straps when wearing the backpack.,
Use the waist strap included in the backpack.,
Make your toddler’s backpack as easy to carry as possible.,
Give your child time to practice with the backpack.,
Ask your child whether the backpack feels comfortable.,
Pack only the essentials.,
Include emergency contact details on the backpack.,
Frequently check your child’s backpack to make sure it still fits him.,
Clean the backpack regularly.,
Wipe the backpack with a damp cloth.",How to Choose Your Toddler's First Backpack," Shoulder straps should be wide and padded – wide shoulder straps allow for better weight and load distribution. Padded ones provide extra comfort and ease of use for your toddler.


Narrow straps tend to “dig” in the shoulders and cause undue discomfort after carrying the backpack for some time. You will notice thin red marks on your toddler’s shoulder after removing the backpack which may not go away for a while.
Narrow straps may also cause friction against your toddler’s skin when carrying the backpack while walking, which can lead to skin irritation.;
, The portion of the bag that is in contact with your toddler’s back should be padded as well. This ensures that no sharp or pointy objects such as pencils, rulers or craft materials poke on to your child’s back. A padded back also increases comfort when carrying the bag.

, The backpack itself should be lightweight but durable – if money is a factor when choosing the right backpack for your child, there are affordable backpacks that are made of lightweight and durable materials.


It is generally advisable to buy a backpack made with high denier polyester or nylon. Choose a backpack made with 600 denier fabric like the Lands’ End Classmate Backpack (usually priced at $34.00).
These bags are made with 600 denier polyester body and 1,200 denier polyester base. Denier refers to the fineness of the fabric and is directly proportional to the strength of the fabric, i.e. the higher the denier, the stronger the fabric.

, Taller backpacks are better than wider ones because taller backpacks “hug” the natural curve of your child’s back and are generally within your child’s center of gravity.


Center of gravity refers to the imaginary point where the total weight of the body is concentrated.
Since wider backpacks distribute load far away from your child’s back (on the sides), it doesn’t generally fall within your child’s center of gravity thus providing undue strain and stress on the back.

, You can’t let your child carry a backpack that is bigger than they are, therefore it's important to choose the right backpack size for your child.


The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that a child carries no more than 10-15 percent of her body weight in a backpack.This means that if your child weighs 50 pounds, the total weight she should (and can) carry in her backpack should not weigh more than 5 pounds.
Use your regular bathroom weighing scale to give you an idea of how much your child is carrying. From there, adjustments can be made.

, Toddler's are always spilling things, dropping things, and dragging their stuff along the ground, so it's important to choose a backpack that can be cleaned easily.


The backpack should be machine washable, so you should look for hard-wearing synthetic fabrics like nylon and polyester, which are water-resistant materials.
However, if you prefer a more eco-friendly backpack, you can go for one made from natural fibers.

, It is best to choose the backpack in person, so you get a more accurate idea of the size and feel. These things can be difficult to gauge when ordering online.


You can also check to see if all of your child's items fit inside the bag before purchasing, which you cannot do when buying online.
The materials used in the backpack can also be easily checked and inspected when bought in person.

, Even at this young age, your child has already started expressing her own individuality. Therefore, it's a good idea to bring your child with you when shopping for a new backpack, so she can pick one that she loves.


Allowing your child to take part in the decision-making process will give them a sense of importance and responsibility and help them to feel like a ""big kid"".
There are many bags available these days that mix function with fashion. Many backpacks feature popular cartoon characters or a mix of bright colors. Your child can also personalize he backpack by adding stickers, patches and charms.

, Backpacks should always be carried using the two shoulder straps, even though kids generally like to carry their backpacks using only one strap slung on one shoulder at a time.


Parents and school administrators should actually discourage this practice because it distributes the load unevenly.
Even though carrying back packs this way won’t cause scoliosis (a sideways curve of the spine), it promotes bad posture and causes undue stress to your child’s back.

, Hooking the waist strap around your child's waist helps to distribute the load across your child’s body as it sits the load on the large muscles of the hips and legs, along with the large muscles of the back and shoulders.

, Do not put too many things inside your child’s backpack. Make sure that you are only putting the necessary items, like books and coloring pencils.


If everything your child needs won’t fit inside, consider getting another bag like a lunch box for his snacks in order to avoid over packing your child’s backpack.
Remember to put the heaviest things near your child’s back for the most even weight distribution.

, Have a practice session with your toddler where she carries the bag and walks around the house to see if it’s comfortable.


If she finds it uncomfortable, adjust the shoulder straps or the contents inside the bag to ensure that there are no sharp or pointy objects poking into her back.
Also, make sure that there are no straps dangling from the bag that could cause your toddler to trip; or worse, dangling straps that could get caught in a car or classroom door. You can just cut the straps if they’re too long or sew the dangling straps to shorten them.

, Your child’s backpack must not prevent her from moving comfortably, or cause her to stumble or slip.


Make sure that the backpack can be used for extended periods without causing any discomfort.
Your child should be able to enjoy field trips or walks to school while carrying her backpack.

, Before you pack your child's backpack, it is important to ask yourself a number of questions to ensure that you don't overpack. Ask yourself what the child will be doing that day and what essential items they need. Some necessary items might include:


A small water bottle, that won't spill.
A change of clothes in case the child gets dirty or has an accident.
A healthy snack.
A small case for health-related items like allergy meds, hearing aids, or eye glasses.

, Your child’s backpack must include both her name and your name, in case the bag gets lost. Include your contact number or in case you can’t be reached, include the person to be contacted next.


You may also want to include the name and number of your child's doctor, in case of a medical emergency.
Children's backpacks often come with a small tag where you can write this information. If not, consider writing it in permanent marker on the inside of the backpack.

, Your child is growing up fast. Do not assume that she will be using the backpack for several years as. she will need a bigger, sturdier backpack as she grows., Toddlers are always on the move, which means their backpacks tend to become worn and dirty pretty quickly. To maintain the backpack for as long as possible, be sure to empty the bag often and wash it every two months. Also:


Check to see if there are any holes that needed to be sewn.
Ensure that the wheels are functioning properly. They must still be sturdy and not wobbly.
Ensure that the zippers can still be closed and opened smoothly.
Make sure any buckles can be easily snapped open and shut.

, Use damp cloths to wipe the outside and inside of the backpack between washes. If you see dirt stains, it is best to wipe them off immediately, to prevent staining.

Pick the right size.,
Find the right fit.,
Decide on the type of frame.,
Inspect the straps.,
Keep quality in mind.,
Ventilate yourself on the trail.",How to Buy a Good Backpack1," Whereas school backpacks come in standard sizes, hiking bags have a wide range to choose from. Think about whether you need your backpack for one day, a weekend or a full-fledged trek across mountainous terrain.


A day-pack will hold things like lunch, camera, sweatshirt and first-aid kit. They are no more than 2500 cubic inches or 40 liters.Weekend backpacks can hold more things like a small tent, sleeping bag and sets of clothes. They are 2500 to 3999 cubic inches or 40 to 65 liters.
Expedition backpacks are for the serious explorer and can be over 6000 cubic inches or 95 liters. They will hold all your gear on hikes that last longer than a weekend and containers that keep food from bears.;
, Hiking for long periods makes the fit of a backpack that much more important. Find a friend or salesperson to help measure your torso. Hiking backpacks come in different lengths regardless of how many things they fit. Consider packs designed for your frame.


The length of your torso is measured from the base of your neck to the small of your back.
Women’s packs have narrower shoulder straps and customized hip belts., Depending on your needs, you will want to choose the appropriate frame. Day-packs are frame-less, while longer hikes require either internal or external frames.


External frame packs offer more stability, but are not as adjustable as internal frames.
External frames are good when hiking in open areas and when heat is an issue, because they offer more ventilation.
Internal frame packs are more form-fitting and can work better in tight spaces.
Internal frames help you move around easier than external ones and are good for skydiving or mountain climbing.

, The right shoulder straps are important, but hiking packs have a variety of choices. Look at whether the pack offers compression, sternum and waist straps.The right ones can help stabilize weight, fit better and keep you on the trail longer.


Find padded shoulder straps. If not completely padded, the pads should lay one to two inches below the high point of your shoulders.
Consider compression straps, if you want a versatile size. These straps will prevent your bag from flopping around when not completely filled.
Sternum straps should be used if you need extra stability for carrying large loads.
Any hike longer than a half day should use waist straps (hip belt). These will distribute the weight of your bag evenly and prevent a sore back. They can be padded for extra cushioning.

, Hiking can require spending hours in the wilderness. Make sure the craftsmanship of your bag is on point and free of loose threads, raw fabric edges or uneven stitching.


Zippers should have a covering for fabric.
Weight matters. Look for packs no more than three pounds for long hikes.

, Hiking can be long and vigorous. You don’t want to get sweatier than you have to by using fabric that doesn’t breath. Look for mesh backing and foam shoulders.

Hydrate quickly with a hydration sleeve.,
Think about how you need to access the pack.,
Consider pockets to make your hike easier.,
Weatherproof your pack.,
Think about a sleeping bag compartment.,
Decide on removable pieces.",How to Buy a Good Backpack2," Many packs offer a hydration pouch system, which is a designated reservoir for water built into the pack. You can easily grab the sleeve when you get thirsty., Many packs designed for long hikes are top-loading. This is good for unloading a campsite. Other activities may require easier access to lunch or cameras. Some will offer side zippers to easily get to the main compartment.

, Multi-sized pockets on the outside and inside of your pack will make it easier to grab a protein bar, or camera to take that rare bird photo. Look for small pockets for your cellphone or GPS.Elasticized side pockets stretch to hold medium sized objects like tent poles or water bottles.
Hip-belt pockets are great for small items you want to get to quickly.
Shovel pockets can be used for larger items like a cover-up or what it was originally intended for - a snow shovel.

, External frames have outside attachments for things like sleeping bags. Find a thick, rain resistant covering for your sleeping bag. If you want extra protection, consider a cover for your entire bag. It will prevent rain from seeping through zippers.

, Some packs have a large pocket at the bottom suited perfectly for a sleeping bag. If you don’t want to put a sleeping bag there, it’s a good spot for jackets, clothes or blankets.

, If you want a removable day-pack for when you get to the campsite, look for multi-unit backpacks. Some of these can detach from the larger pack and be used around your waist for a quick hike up a small peak.

Consider day to day comfort.,
Find the right fit.,
Keep quality in mind.,
Think about extra features.,
Choose the right style.",How to Buy a Good Backpack3," Look for backpacks that will be the right size for your daily needs. Using an overly large backpack will make it more likely you will overfill it.Think about how many books or electronics you need to carry.


Don’t try to carry more than 15% of your body weight.
Rolling backpacks can be a great alternative if you have heavy loads.

, Look for padded shoulders and try backpacks on. Two strapped bags are better than single strapped, because they distribute weight better. Try backpacks on, if not shopping online and remember the bottom should rest on the curve of your lower back.

, Loose threads and careless stitching can be dead giveaways of bad quality. A backpack can give years of good use and you want to make sure your investment is durable. Inspect the fabric for any raw edges.

, Backpacks come in all types and extra features can be either useful or unnecessary. If you carry a lot of small items such as pencils, keys or snacks, you may want extra pockets to easily access them. Some bags have padded pockets for computer tablets and laptops. Opt for a more basic backpack, if you don’t need these extra compartments.

, Think about where you will be taking your new backpack. If you are going off to college, you may want a bag that will carry heavy books, but also show some personal style. If you’re traveling in urban areas, you will want a streamlined, modern style.These bags typically have hidden pockets that do not look bulky.

Get a three ring binder.,
Gather your papers.,
Add paper dividers.,
Assemble your binder.,
File papers as soon as you get them.,
Clean out your binder regularly.",How to Organize a Binder1," Choose a size that is best for you. Binders can be 1 inch, 2 inch, 3 inch, or 5 inch.If you are using the binder for more than one class or subject, get a 3 or 5 inch binder. Get the 1 or 2 inch binders if you plan to use separate binders for each of your classes. Do whatever works best for you. Either method is fine.;
, Get all of the papers for you classes that you need to put in your binder including your syllabus, notes, assignments, homework, class requirements, etc. Separate the papers by class/subject and the type of paper (e.g. science notes, science homework, math syllabus, etc.). Place each in separate pile.

This will make it easier to place the times in your binder.

Use a 3 hole punch to put holes in all of your papers that will go in your binder.

, Dividers are used to create separate sections in your binder. The sections should match the type of papers that you have for your class. For example, have a notes section, homework section, projects section, class information section, etc. Label each divider tab and then place it on top of the corresponding papers. You can write on the divider tab or use the computer to type and print the section names.Your teacher may have specific instructions for the sections that you need to include in your binder. Check with your teacher before you label your dividers.You have some options for dividers. Some dividers have pockets that you can slide papers into if you have a few papers that you do not want to punch holes in., Once your papers are sorted and your dividers have been made, put them in your binder. If you are using a single binder for all of your classes, it may be helpful to put the dividers in the same order of your daily schedule. However, organize the sections in an order that makes sense to you. .


Keep extra notebook paper in the back of your binder in case you need it.Always date new papers that you add to your binder., Go ahead and file your papers as soon as you get them. It can be easy to drop papers in your backpack or lose them between home and school. Make a habit of filing them in your binder as soon as you get them. This will help you avoid misplacing papers and stay organized., Your binder can become cluttered with papers that you do not need anymore or old completed assignments. Go through your binder periodically to keep it neat. Set a time period (e.g.every grading period, once a quarter) for how often you will clean out your binder.As you go through your binder, look for torn holes. You want to repair them so you do not lose the paper."

Print your cover page.",How to Make a Cover Page for a Notebook," Choose a notebook that you plan to use for a certain subject. Notebooks come in many different types: there are spiral bound notebooks, composition books, legal pads and 3-ring binders. As long as your notebook has plenty of blank paper and a place to design a cover, it should work.You can decorate the first page of a notebook to use as your cover page or draw directly onto the outside of the notebook. If you decide to decorate the first page, it may be helpful to color-coordinate your notebooks so that you know which subject goes with each color.
Designing your cover page on a computer will be easiest if you use a 3-ring binder since the printed cover page can slip directly into the front of the binder.;
, What will you be using to design your notebook cover page? Get your hands on some markers, paint pens, stickers, glitter—anything you can use to add a splash of style to the blank page. Start thinking about how you might go about designing your notebook. You might come up with a theme based on the subject, or make use of features that reflect your favorite sports team or musical artist. Your possibilities are limited only by how creative you're willing to get.Make sure you're also stocked on notebook paper if you're using a 3-ring binder so you'll be ready to go once your cover page is done.

, Your name and the class subject should be the most noticeable things on your cover page. Somewhere near the top center of the cover page, find a place where the name of the class will go. Think about how you might later decorate the space around the class subject. Don’t write the subject too large since you’ll be adding other information to the cover page.

, Your name can go anywhere you like on the cover page but should be big or bold enough to be easily seen. One good place for it to go is beneath the class subject, or just above it. You could also put your name in one of the upper corners. Depending on how you decide to design your cover page, you have almost unlimited options.

, If it helps you stay mentally organized, save some space to write down the name of the class’s teacher, as well as your homeroom teacher, grade level, suite or other class division and locker number. In addition to being organized, this information will help your notebook find its way back to you should you lose it.Listing your homeroom teacher or locker number will help other students return a lost notebook.

, Once you’ve put down all the information you need for your cover page, you should still have plenty of space to work with. Use this space to doodle, color, write slogans or inside jokes or include any other design element you want. The cover page will be your own, so you should use it to reflect whatever style and interests you want.Use drawings and pictures that fit with the subject of your notebook to give your studies a visual element. If you're designing a notebook for your chemistry class, for instance, sketch a few beakers and flasks or a microscope to go along with the chemistry motif.
As long as it’s not against the rules, you could even write down formulas or other useful tips on your notebook cover to help you remember them. Putting the Pythagorean theorem on a math notebook, for instance, will aid you in learning the theorem so that it’s instantly recognizable to you.

, Use markers, colored pencils and even crayons to add a splash of color to your cover page. This will make it really eye-catching so that it’s not just another dull black-and-white notebook page. Add embellishments to the class subject line or to your name. Once you’ve added some color, your cover page will pop and it will be much more fun to look at.Use your own supplies, or see about borrowing them from your school’s art class.

, You’re not just limited to whatever art supplies you have access to at school or find lying around your house. Give your cover page a new dimension by tacking on stickers, adhesive borders and even cutout paper designs or printed pictures: slap your school crest or mascot on the cover if you want to show your school spirit, or display stickers of your favorite band to let others know that you're a music fan. This will give you more depth than just drawing everything by hand and will give your cover design a cool, crafty look.Use foam craft letters for a cool new way to display your name on your notebook.

, Go one step further and try using supplies like glitter, ribbon and paint to really dazzle with your cover page. These items will allow you to create an amazing, one-of-a-kind cover page that wouldn’t be possible with traditional pen-and-ink designs. There’s really no limit to what you can do if you get creative enough: if you can imagine it, you can make it.


Be careful while gluing decorations onto your notebook and make sure you only use as much as you need. Otherwise the glue can bleed through and make the paper soggy, or you might even accidentally glue pages together., If you’d rather not go the handmade route and prefer the clean simplicity of a computer design, you can use a simple editing program to create your notebook cover page. Programs like Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop or the online editor Pixlr are perfect for this sort of project, although an even simpler program like Microsoft Paint will also do the trick. A photo editor will allow you to produce a more precise design by lining up text, giving you the freedom to choose fonts and adding professional borders. You can even import pictures to use as part of the design.Word processors make it easy to format text the way you want it and add pictures to go with it, while one advantage of photo editing programs is that they give you greater control over how to alter pictures and let you drag, layer and angle bits of text for better customization.
You don't have to limit yourself to just one method—try designing a cover page with the necessary basic information on your computer, then printing it out and finish decorating it by hand.

, Put down all the information you need for your cover page: your name, the notebook’s subject, teacher, grade and homeroom. With a editing program you’ll have the freedom to choose the way you want your text to look and where exactly you want it positioned on the page. Decide how you want to lay out the information on your cover page. You could list it all down the left hand side to save the middle of the page for pictures, or center it and arrange pictures around it.

, Use the “import” or “paste from” option in the editing program to use pictures from the internet as part of your cover page. Pictures can be shrunk or enlarged to better fit the page, or their individual properties can be adjusted. Find pictures or clip art related to the subject you’re studying, or get funky and decorate your notebook with pics of your favorite sport or celebrity. It’s all up to you!Don’t use photos that are graphic or offensive. Remember, your notebook is part of your scholastic materials.

, Instead of just using the text bar to type your name and class information, make use of the word processor's text capabilities, like choosing different fonts and colors, as part of your design. Spell out a couple of lines of song lyrics, or maybe highlight a favorite quotation to keep you motivated to study. Typed text doesn't have to be boring. Play around with text features and see if you can come up with fun new ways to add a few words to your cover.Fonts like Impact, Comic Sans and Wingdings come preloaded on most word processors programs and are more playful than ordinary professional fonts.If you enjoy writing creatively, challenge yourself by coming up with a personalized slogan to act as an introduction for what you'll find in your notebook.

, Once you’ve come up with a design you like, print it and use it for the new cover of your notebook. If you use a 3-ring binder, you can slide the printed page right into the plastic cover and you’re done! If you use a different type of notebook, you’ll have to attach the cover page to your notebook by using tape, glue or staples.Taping or stapling around the edge of the cover page will hold it in place and allow it to be changed out at a later time with little difficulty, while glue will hold better but is messier to work with and isn’t easily removed.
Be careful: watch your fingers while you’re stapling.

Use an assignment book or planner.,
Get a pencil bag.,
Have a catch all folder.,
Get a buddy.,
Consider using an organizational app.,
Ask for help.",How to Organize a Binder2," Keeping all of your assignment due dates in one place will help you turn in your work on time and help you keep up with multiple classes. Write down both the day your assignment is assigned and the day that it is due. Check off assignments as you finish them. If you have not finished an assignment yet, continue to add it to the following day until it is complete. You can keep your assignment book/planner in one of your binder pockets.
Look ahead in your planner to see when everything is due. Read your planner at the end of each day so you know what you need to take home with you.

, A pencil bag with holes can also be included in your binder. Put pencils, pens, erasers and other small items in the bag.

It is easier to stay organized when everything you need is in one place., You may not always have time to file your papers neatly in your binder throughout the day. Keep a special folder for items that need to filed. At the end of the day, file all the papers in your binder.

This will keep your papers from getting crumbled in the bottom of your backpack and keep your from forgetting the papers all together., Have a buddy in each of your classes that you can call in case you forget an assignment or have questions about something. Check in with this person at the end of class to make sure you both have written down your assignment information correctly. You can also ask the person what he or she is taking home from school that day.You can also share pens and pencils with your buddy if one of you forgets.
Trade phone numbers with your buddy in case you need to call them when you get home.

, In addition to having your binder, you can try using an app to help you organize all of your assignments. MyHomework Student Planner and Studious let you keep track of your class schedules, due dates, and reminders for assignments and are more suited for college students.Complete Class Organizer, EpicWin, Chore Pad HD, iHomework, and iRewardChart Lite are good for children and adolescents.These apps should be used in combination with your binder and are not a substitute.

, If you are struggling to stay organized or feel overwhelmed by all of your assignments, talk to your teacher and/or parent. They can help you organize your binder. Many students are able to stay organized once a good system has been set up.Do not be afraid to speak up. It takes time to learn good organizational skills.

Use stickers.,
Draw.,
Use duct tape.,
Print out some pictures.,
Make a collage.",How to Decorate School Supplies1," One of the easiest and best ways of decorating your notebooks, binders, and other school supplies is to use stickers. Head to the craft store or the hobby store and find some stickers that you like, and decorate your notebooks.


Apply the stickers in unusual patterns for a neat effect. Even if you've just got a bunch of football stickers, if you make them into the shape of a face, or a peace sign, it might be cool.;
, Want to show your creativity? Instead of letting stickers do the work, draw on the notebooks yourself using pencil or marker. Even if the pictures don't look that great, you'll personalize your own stuff.


You don't have to draw complicated pictures. Write out song lyrics that you like, or your own name, or funny messages.
If you're not a great drawer, print out some pictures, cut them out, and tape them onto your notebook, then trace around them. It'll look like you did the drawing yourself!

, One cool and kind of punk rock style for your schools supplies is to put duct tape on everything. Wrap duct tape around the binding of your books, or around the spiral of your notebook. Put strips of duct tape across the cover of your notebook, and write your name on it. Use duct tape in a variety of ways.


Duct tape doesn't have to be gray and boring. You can find pink, yellow, red, and a bunch of other colors of duct tape at the store. Use a variety for a neat effect.

, you can even get more creative and use a certain wrapping paper that has cool designs and put it on the front, or coloring pages that have cool pictures.


You can even use little pictures from your childhood make a decorative paper frame for it, and put it behind a plastic cover on a folder or a binder.

, Print out pictures you like or look through magazines for them. They could be anything, including nice patterns, celebrities, pictures of animals, cartoons, quotes, logos, or anything that catches your eye. It's a good idea to have a mix of photos, patterns, quotes for a balanced and fun collage. You could also cut out letters and spell out your name or subject, or maybe add your own photos.

Wrap your pencils in decorative tape.,
Make some pencil toppers.,
Make some book covers.",How to Decorate School Supplies2," Get some glittery, patterned, or decorative tape at the crafts store. Then, take as much tape as you need for your pencil, and then cut it off at the end. Start wrapping from the eraser end of the pencil, so it's easy to just take off some tape and wrap it back around when you need to sharpen.

, Think of pencil toppers like old school finger puppets. Draw or download a pic of the top half of your favorite cartoon, comic book character, or athlete. Make sure it is big enough so that a pencil top can fit inside like a finger would in a finger puppet. It is paper that you will join with tape so it needs to be about 2 1/2 times the pencils width.


Color it in with another piece of paper underneath, then cut out your coloured puppet shape. Lay them together and cover front and back in tape. Cut the tape, leaving a little boarder around the character as protection. Slip it over the pencil.

, You can use construction paper, wrapping paper, or newspaper with cutouts of characters on them. You can also print out pictures on plain white paper, or draw your own drawings on it. Cut to the size of your book jacket and tape in place, after covering with clear plastic contact paper.


Take black paper, or your favorite color of paper, and cut a rectangle in it. Under that, layer a white sheet of paper and draw eyes on it to look like a ninja face. Boys will love this.
If the girls are into frozen, make Elsa and Anna and then use Olaf or snowflakes for other things that will be easier to draw. Copy what pics you can and cut up cereal boxes or junk mail for others.
If the boys like dinosaurs, remember a green book with one great big eye is easier than the whole animal.

,
Do not write on your folder, because it will look dirty or tacky.

,
Write the date on every page you get.,
Stay neat and follow these steps.",How to Keep Your Binder Clean and Organized," Will you have one per subject? Or one for everything? You could have a few subjects per binder (e.g. French, Spanish and German in one, Biology, Physics and Chemistry in another etc).;
, If you often rip paper out of your binder and do not bother to put hand-outs in their appropriate place, buy a binder that can zip up. This prevents the papers from falling out.

, Always try to choose a binder that has pockets on the back of the front cover, and the front of the back cover. Also label your binder with printable labels or the strips of paper included.This is good for emergencies or small papers that are not hole-punched. Just stick them in the pocket and organize them when you get home. If not, the papers may fall out and you forget where you put them, or they might get lost.

, Keep your binder organized by having dividers so that you know where everything is. If you have dividers, finding a specific sheet of paper will be much easier, and will save you time when you need it to study or lend out some lined paper to a friend. You should have dividers for:


Handouts
Notes
Different subjects
Blank paper
Lined paper
Essays or Projects

, Try buying dividers with tabs that stick out of the sides. They may be numbered or have little blank labels. Write on the labels so you can easily figure out where something is.

, Always hole-punch sheets right away if they are not already hole-punched, and then put them in their proper place as soon as you get them. This will save you a lot of time, instead of stuffing the paper in and wasting time finding it later.

, Do not leave the class without putting all of your notes and handouts in their proper places.

, Once a week, sit on your bed, couch, or chair and flip through your binder. Take this time to organize anything that seems messy.

, Do not rip paper out of your binder, because the paper will not be able to stay in the rings and may fall out. If you do find yourself ripping out paper very often, have lots of re-enforcements on hand so you can repair the paper.

, It's great to have one plastic folder in every binder to put your homework in. That way, you can put your homework assignments from each class in there and know what you need to work on when you get home. You could also keep anything you have to study in a separate plastic folder.

,,, Just in case the binders rings fall apart, write the date on every piece of paper you get to keep organized and know the order of everything you have studied. This will really help you when you need to study or review (or if your binder falls apart)

, A healthy binder leads to healthy studying and better grades!

Decide if you want to add more decorations to your wrapping.",How to Decorate Your School Binder1," There are a wide variety of things you can make your cover out of, but perhaps the easiest and most versatile choice is paper. Paper covers are easy to work with, and easy to switch out if your mood and interests change, or if you want a new cover for a new season or holiday. Consider any of the following:


Paper grocery bag: This old standby is quick, easy, and usually free. Plus, it's fairly durable. The plainer your bag is, the more you'll be able to add later in terms of drawings and decorations.
Wrapping Paper: A little less durable and a little more expensive than thick paper bags, but the patterns and designs can make your binder look quite stylish! Save the remnants after you wrap gifts, and scope out sales on wrapping paper after holidays have passed to snag awesome patterns and designs.
Printable cover: Try using a search engine to look for ""free printable book/binder covers."" You should be able to find a good selection of free templates you can print off at home — be sure to pick a design that's the right size for your binder!;
, While you certainly don't have to, you may like the look of neatly ironed paper or fabric. If you are ironing fabric, simply choose the correct heat setting as indicated on your iron. If you're ironing paper, you'll need to take a couple of extra steps:


Begin by lightly misting the wrinkled paper with water from a spray bottle. Place a hand towel on your ironing board, place the paper on top, and then place another hand towel over the dampened paper.
On a low-heat setting, iron the paper through the towel, checking every so often to see if the wrinkles are being worked out.

, Your wrapping material should extend past the edges of your binder when you open it and lay it down. Aim for at least ½ to 1-inch of overhang.If your material doesn't reach past the edges of your binder, it won't be able to cover it completely.


If using a paper grocery bag, cut lengthwise down one of the sides. Cut the bottom off and spread the paper flat. This will give you a single flat sheet of paper to use.
If using wrapping paper or fabric, simply roll out a length of paper (or lay out the fabric), set your binder on it cover-side down, then cut when you have enough material.

, Depending upon where the rings are positioned in your binder, one side of the binder may be wider when it's open and flat (usually the left side). If you want a clean, finished look when you open your binder, you may want the center strip to be covered with paper or fabric, too.Measure the length and width of this center strip, and then cut a piece of your wrapping material to fit. This piece should fit exactly, with no overhang.

, If you have cut a center strip of paper or fabric, apply it to the inside of your binder, with either tape or glue.


If you're using fabric, consider spraying the back of the fabric strip with spray adhesive, and then firmly press the fabric in place., Next, place your open binder, outside facing down, on the paper with the longer sides pointing to the left and right. If you are using wrapping paper or something with a design on it, make sure that the “front” of the paper is down facing the table.


Fold the top and bottom edges of the paper over the binder and lightly crease to mark to the fold. Remove the binder and crease the folds firmly in place.
Note that you won't necessarily be able to get a crease in non-paper materials like fabric. You can feel free to skip the creasing step with fabric if you like.

, Place your binder back on the paper, lining it up with the creases you just made. Now, fold the paper over the short edges of the binder and make creases just like before.


You may need to deal with the front and back creases of your binder one-at-a-time here — it can be tricky to keep both folded at the same time.

, Now, simply fold the long edges of the paper around your binder, followed by the short edges. Your binder should now have a cover that fits it snugly but not so tightly that it can't open and close easily. All you need to do is secure your cover in place so that it doesn't fall off.


If using paper, tape usually works perfectly well. When removing tape, be careful not to tear the material of your binder.

, If you're using a fabric cover and weren't able to get a tight crease, no need to worry! Simply spray the backside of the fabric with adhesive, and place the open binder on it.


Begin by folding the top and bottom edges over, and then fold in the side edges. It usually works best to begin at the center of the binder near the rings and work your way out.
Apply more adhesive as necessary., Cut two pieces of cardstock for the inside covers of the binder. Spray with adhesive (or line the edges with glue), and firmly place over the edges that you've wrapped around from the front.This will create a nice clean look when you open your binder.

, Congratulations — you've just covered your binder. However, you don't necessarily have to stop here — you've now got a blank canvas to work with! See the suggestions below for decoration ideas.

Draw doodles on your wrapped binder.,
Draw sketches on your binder cover.,
Paint your binder cover.,
Use stencils to create awesome designs.,
Create artistic labels for your binders.",How to Decorate Your School Binder2," Binders offer great opportunities to express yourself artistically, especially if you've covered your binder in paper or fabric that's easy to draw on. Consider simply using your binder as a doodling surface — whenever you get bored, simply add a new sketch or design to it. This way, your binder will gradually get more detailed and unique over time.


Sharpie markers will draw on nearly any surface (even the slick plastic of a binder) and come in a variety of colors.If drawing on paper, nearly any pen or marker will work.
If you covered your binder in fabric, try fabric pens or markers., If you're not content with the simple, messy look of a doodled binder cover, spend a little more time making a deliberate, detailed drawing or sketch. This will take a little more skill and effort, but the results can be quite impressive. You can pick anything for your drawing, from a simple still-life scene (like a single object) to a detailed landscape — it just depends how much time you'd like to spend on your project!


If you choose a neutral colored paper in a mid-range grey or brown, you may be able to create more nuanced shading and shadow-effects. Use graphite and/or charcoal pencils for mid to dark lines, and you can use a white colored pencil for highlights.Once you're done with your sketch, you may want to protect it by carefully covering it with see-through tape. You can also use a protective spray (which are usually available at art supply stores and sold as ""workable matte"" or ""workable fixatif"")., Painting takes a little more deliberate effort than drawing or doodling, but the colorful results can be amazing (especially if you're willing to take your time.) However, if you want to avoid the paint leaking through your cover to your binder, strongly consider taking the cover off first and painting it over a protective surface, like newspaper.


Most basic acrylic and watercolor paints should work well on paper covers.
Fabric, on the other hand, may require special fabric paints or even puff paints. Check your paint's label before using it to make sure it's suitable for use on fabric.
For best results, your fabric should be a tight weave, so that the paint doesn't bleed through. Cotton is an excellent choice, though you can experiment with other tight-weave fabrics like rayon or silk., Don't have the time to make your own drawing or painting freehand? Just use a stencil! Stencils make it easy to add good-looking designs to your binder cover in just a few seconds. You can trace the outlines of stencils or fill them in — it's up to you.


If you're using paint, tape your stencil down so that it's tight against your binder cover before you start. Apply your paint sparingly. If your stencil isn't tight or you use too much paint, paint can leak under the edges and leave you with a messy design.You can make your own stencils, too — just print pictures and carefully cut around the edges with a pair of scissors or craft knife.

, Are you using your binder for school or work? If so, you may want to label it so that you remember what's supposed to go in it, but you of course want the label to look awesome.


For example, draw “Chemistry” in bold, fun lettering across the front of your binder cover, but consider adding a beaker with colorful chemicals in it as well. Be as creative as you wish here — as long as you can keep your binders straight, there's no such thing as a ""wrong"" label!

Choose your collage images.,
Crop the images.,
Secure the images.,
Cover or seal the collage.",How to Decorate Your School Binder3," Making a collage is easy and fun! To start, gather a big collection of pictures to use. Exactly which pictures you use is up to you, but here are a few ideas to get you thinking:


You could use pictures of your friends, family or pets. Make sure you have permission before cutting up old family photos.
You could cut images from your favorite magazines, such as pictures of celebrities, athletes, or fun fashions.
You could use newspaper headlines.
You could use old comic or ""funny page"" clippings.
You could use interesting postcards or stamps from places you've visited or would like to visit.
You could use individual letters to spell words and phrases (""ransom note"" style).

, Cut each picture you're using into a size and shape that will allow everything to fit together more or less like a jigsaw. Your pictures can overlap somewhat — this is perfectly fine (and if you don't want any of the surface underneath to show through, it's something you should shoot for.)


Set your pictures down where you want them to go, but don't stick them down yet. Feel free to try different layouts and designs. Once you start securing your pictures, it will be trickier to make any adjustments.

, Once you know where you want everything placed, begin to stick each piece down. A small dab of school glue or a rub from a glue stick usually works well.


You can glue the images to your paper-covered binder or, if you don't mind ruining your binder, directly to the binder itself. Test the first couple of pieces to make sure the glue you are using holds firm.
On the other hand, if your binder has clear plastic sleeves on the outside, you can just glue your collage to a piece of paper and slide it into the sleeve.

, Collages can look great, but since they're made of so many tiny pieces, they're vulnerable to having pieces tear and fall off. Luckily, there are a few ways to protect collages:


You can seal your collage with it with a paint-on fixative (Mod podge is a popular product that dries clearly).You can also find spray-on fixatives and sealants (Krylon Crystal Clear is a product to try).If you don't have these products, you can try carefully covering the entire collage with clear packing tape, pressing each piece smooth to avoid wrinkles.

Use negative space designs.,
Make a metallic gum wrapper cover.,
Use old calendar photos for big, gorgeous images.,
Make duct tape patterns.,
Add your favorite quotes.,
Give your binder an aged look.,
Bedazzle your binder.,
Make a collaborative cover with your friends.",How to Decorate Your School Binder4," So you're not content with the basic ideas above? In this section, we'll discuss some more ""out-there"" ideas for covering your binder. For example, if your binder and the cover are different colors, consider using a negative space design for a striking effect.


Negative space is the area that surrounds an object. Playing with both negative and positive space in your picture will help bring balance and interest to your design.To create a negative space design, take a blank cover and cut shapes, letters, pictures, and so on into it — the binder underneath will show through and appear to give these shapes their own color.
If you're worried about the holes in your cover allowing your binder to wear, cover them with clear packing tape. You'll still get the negative space effect, but your binder will be well-protected.

, Ever notice how chewing gum usually comes in a shiny foil wrapper? If you have a lot of these wrappers lying around, you can use them to give your binder a cool metallic sheen. Gently flatten the gum wrappers and stick them to your binder cover (or the binder itself) with a small amount of glue. Repeat until the whole surface is covered. Voila—a metallic binder.


If you're having a hard time getting the wrappers perfectly smooth, try rubbing them with a coin or the front of your fingernail to smooth them out.
You can also use clear packing tape here as well to put a clear protective layer over your wrappers.

, Don't throw away your calendars after the year is over — instead, use the photos or artwork inside as a cover.


Simply cut the picture out, lay it on your binder, trim the edges to fit if necessary, and cover it with clear packing tape to secure it.

, This thick, durable tape is great for protecting your binder and can give it a semi-metallic sheen. You can also find a wide array of color selections. If you don't want to stick the tape directly to your binder, try making a ""sheet"" of tape by sticking two layers of tape so that their sticky sides face each other.


Making basic designs like checkerboards and stripes is fairly simple and will definitely liven up your binder.
On the other hand, you can also make more complex designs with the ""negative space"" approach. Cover your binder with one color, then lay a second (different-colored) layer on top of this. Carefully cut shapes from the top layer with a craft knife and peel them off to make a negative space design.

, Give your binder a dash of humor or inspiration by recreating your favorite quotes on the cover. For instance, try typing your favorite speech excerpts, song lyrics, or poems on the computer.


Be sure to pick an attractive font, print out the quote, and then affix it to your binder with clear packing tape.
You can also try your hand at calligraphy.

, For something a little out-of-the-box, you can try “aging” a paper cover by soaking it in tea. This can make it look like your binder is an old-fashioned book or tome!


See our wikiHow on how to age paper using tea for detailed instructions.

, Even if your binder contains boring history or math homework, it doesn't mean that the outside of it can't be fun and fabulous.


Glue on rhinestones or sequins for a binder that sparkles.

, You don't necessarily have to make your binder cover all by yourself. One fun idea is to give your binder a plain white cover and have each of your friends add something different to it (like a doodle, sticker, funny saying, etc.)


This way, when you get your binder back, you'll have something amusing on it to remind you of each friend! Plus, your binder cover will become a cherished keepsake that you'll enjoy looking at years down the road.

, This means you should always put back things where they belong. This will obviously make your locker neater and more organized.

, Wrappers, soda bottles, and etc. Put trash items in a trash can or in the recycle bin. Don't leave them lying around because that isn't good for the environment.

, Try the little square ones and put them at the bottom.

, Whenever you have a lesson, you probably go to your locker and just shove your books in, get the books out for next period, then shove them in again. This is just like a cycle of messiness. Take your books out (yes all of them) and order them in a neat pile. Or, you could make a certain order which your books go in or even (depending on how big your locker is) make half a shelf for a couple of subjects each.


Each class has a textbook. Period one textbook goes first, then second period textbook, and so on. This will help you locate your books and it helps you remember the order.

, You should be able to grab them along with your textbooks.

, Try putting it up with a magnet, so it sticks.

, Such as: deodorant, a hairbrush, and extra clothing.

, You can't go with your backpack everywhere!

, To personalize your locker, you could have posters, magnets and even accessories made specifically for lockers, such as mini chandeliers. These things may fall off or get in the way, so use a generous amount of blue tack and cello tape.

, Always remember to shut your locker. If you leave your phone out, this is not a good idea, as people could look through your locker and steal it, along with any other valuables.

Put a white sticky label on each binder.,
Do not draw, scribble or write on the cover of your binder (keep it neat).,
If your binder gets lost, take action.,
Put the label on the front cover of the binder, not on the inside, so you recognize it if you see it.,
To prevent losing your binder in the first place, remember to keep your binders in a ""locked position"".,
If allowed, buy a gym bag, or a hand bag to put all your binders inside, which make it easier to carry around from class to class.,

,
At school, make sure your backpack is always closed (zipped up) properly to avoid binders falling out.

",How to Keep Your Binders Safe at School," These ready-to-use labels can be purchased at most stores. If you do not own these, cut up little rectangular pieces of paper and glue them on the binder with tape. On the label, write the following:


Name: ____________
Class:____________
Teacher:__________
Subject:__________

and a little note (on a separate label) that says: Please return if found, thanks.
By including this note, you are showing this binder is important to you.

;
, If you treat your binder badly, then papers may fall out and notes might get lost. Additionally, if you keep your binders cover messy, others may think it is not important, and may steal it to wreck it even more, or they won't bother to return it to you. Keep your binder neat.

, Go to the office and ask to announce it on the speaker. Say something like ""There was a pink Hilroy binder lost Friday, October 7th at 1st period. It is a science binder. Please return to room 403"". If you let the students/teachers know that it is missing, they will return it if they see it.

, Put a little sticker (that is noticeable) on the front and back cover of the binder, so you will recognise it. Do this with all your binders, so you recognize all of them. If you do not want to put a sticker on your binder, then you can simply write your name (big) with permanent marker on the top of the binder, so if teachers see it with another student (or if it is lost) they know who to return it to right away.

, This is how to do it


Put one binder from large end (the part with the rings) to small end (where binder opens and closes) on a table. Stack another binder on top of it from small end to large end, which forms a rectangle that is easy to carry, instead of carrying your binders messily, as they might fall out.

, Alternatively, ask if you are allowed to use your backpack to carry your binders in. This will keep your binders all together and easy to carry around. They will be safe, and by your side, so that they won't get lost

, What to do? You should keep your binders on top of your desk, under your chair, or you can sit on them (if they are strong). Alternatively, if you sit next to a window or cupboard, then place them on the top of the cupboard or on the window ledge.

, Make sure to try to hide them using clothing or stack your binders with a friend and cover them with clothing. Do not make a large pile or it will be obvious.

Get the correct binder for you.,
Buy or make some dividers.,
Label a subject on each divider for each class.,
Place dividers in your binder.,
Organize the papers in each subject.,
Get or find accessories.,
Maintain your system.",How to Be Organized for School with One Binder," Binders come in different sizes, so if you desire just one binder, you have to make sure you can fit all of your notes and materials. In general, a ""D"" ring binder will fit more material than an ""O"" ring. Be sure your binder is sturdy--floppy sides will not hold up to the rigors of higher education.


In general, a 2"" binder will be fine for a middle or high school aged student.
You may have the option of buying a binder with a clear plastic cover, or not. Clear plastic covers allow for you to easily insert a paper on the cover, side, and back, which is handy for labelling. While optional, this can be helpful.
You may also have the option of purchasing a binder with interior pockets. These pockets are helpful to place papers that are not 3-hole punched. However, they can be tempting to ""stuff"" papers in without organizing--as discussed later, this is a bad habit that can result in a disorganized binder.;
, Commercial dividers are thick paper or plastic inserts that will help you separate and label your schoolwork. These will make it easier to find your English notes when you need them. You can make your own dividers by 3-hole punching some thick paper, oak tag - heavy cardstock, or the like.

, Labels will help you find your section quickly. You may also want a section for:


Assignment calendar/ Assignment book (if kept in your binder)
Extra Paper
Any activity that you may want to keep in your folder. For example, you may want to keep your lines for the school play in your binder. Or notes on various football plays.

, Be sure your first divider is the first page of your binder, and last page is also a divider. Dividers ideally should be tougher material than your papers. This will prevent your paper from wrinkling and possibly being lost with use. The last divider does not really need a label.

, Usually, notes will be chronological: the early notes in front, the later ones in back. If this is a new marking period, you may not have anything yet.

,


Three-hole puncher. Most teachers have one in their classroom. However, small versions exist that can be put directly into your binder.
""Notebook"" Paper. If you're taking notes, you need notebook paper. Put some pages of notebook paper in each section to ready it for note-taking.
Paper reinforcers. These are stickers in the shape of the letter ""O"". They fix the broken holes that occasionally happen with notebook paper.
Pencil pouch. Special pouches are made for binders where you can easily store your pens, pencils, erasers, reinforcers,and so on.

, It is one thing to get organized, but your work will come to nothing if you do not stay organized!


Keep one section for each class. Do not mix up classes.
Secure every piece of paper. Loose papers run away. Always punch papers that do not have holes and secure them. Even in a folder or pocket in your binder for papers in need of hole-punching, papers have a tendency to disappear.
Never stuff papers thoughtlessly. Every paper needs a home. Cram your papers in your binder or in your bookbag, even if in a rush. Give a little thought to where it should go. Taking 10 seconds to do so can save you 10 minutes or more later.
If it does not have a place, you need to give some thought to what sort of place you need to make.
Organize regularly. At least once a week, check that notes are in the right place, loose papers put in the right place, and throw out outdated or useless items.

Have 5 minutes while waiting for something in class? This is a good use of that time.

Choose a paper bag to cover your book with.,
Cut open your brown paper shopping bag along one seam.,
Cut off the flaps formed by the bottom of the bag.,
Place the book in the center of the paper.",How to Create a Paper Bag Book Cover1," It will need to be at least double the width of your book, so that it can cover both the front and back. It also needs to be 3 in (7.6 cm) taller than the height of your book in order to fit properly., Choose either side, rather than the bottom. Be sure you don’t cut both sides, only one. Remove the handles if it has any.








, Don’t cut more than 1 to 2 in (2 to 5 cm). You want one large sheet of paper.








, Make sure the paper is large enough to cover the book in its entirety. Check that the paper will wrap around the book, covering the front and back.

Slip the cover onto the book.",How to Make a Duct Tape Book Cover1," Use a ruler to measure the height of your book. Next, measure the width of your book, from cover to cover—this includes the spine as well. Add 6½ inches (16.51 centimeters) to the width and ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) to the height. Write these numbers down and save them for later.








This method works great for soft cover books. It can also be used for hardcover books and text books.
Another optional, easy way to determine your cover size is to trace your book onto paper, and add the flaps along the outside of your tracing.;
, It would be a good idea to cut them a little bit longer than you need to. This way, you can cut down any unevenness at the end and get the exact size you need.







, Overlap each strip by about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Keep laying down overlapping strips until the fabric is the height of your book (plus the extra ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter).









It would be easiest to work on top of a cutting mat. This way, you can peel the sheet off when you are done.
If you don't have a cutting mat, you can work on top of a large sheet of wax paper--just be sure to tape down the edges so that it doesn't slide around!

, Carefully peel the duct tape fabric off of the cutting mat. Flip it over so that the sticky side is showing.








, Lay down your first strip about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) above the top edge. Continue laying down strips of duct tape, overlapping them by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Extend the last strip ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) past the bottom edge. The seams between the pieces will be offset, thus reducing bulk.







, Flip your duct tape fabric over once more. Fold the excess tape at the bottom and top edges down onto the front of the duct tape fabric.







, Use a metal ruler and a craft blade to cut down the side edges until your cover is the right width. This includes the entire width of your book plus the additional 6½ inches (16.51 centimeters). If you don't have a metal ruler and craft blade, use a ruler and marker to draw a cutting line, then cut the fabric with scissors.








, Wrap the duct tape fabric around the front cover, spine, and back cover. There will be about 3¼ inches (8.26 centimeters) of excess duct tape fabric on each edge. Fold this excess duct tape fabric over the edges of the cover and onto the inside.







, Slide the book out, but keep the excess duct tape folded inside. Run your fingernail along the folds to make a crease. This will give you a nice, crisp finish and make your cover look neater.








, Measure the height and width of your book cover. Cut two strips of duct tape according to those measurements. Cut each strip in half lengthwise. This will make the bindings for the edges.









You can use the same tape as before or a coordinating color/pattern.

, Lay down the long strips of tape along the top and bottom edges—keep the flaps folded down. Make sure that half of each strip extends over the top and bottom edges. Flip the cover over, and fold the excess tape down onto the inside.







, Your top and bottom bindings are covering the edges of the side flaps, preventing them from opening them all the way. Cut through the tape in these areas so that you can open the flaps all the way. Do not cut through the actual cover, however.







, Take one of your short strips of duct tape and turn it so that the sticky side is facing you. Slide it under one of the flaps so that half of it is visible. Run your finger along the inside edge of the flap, then fold the excess tape down onto the front. Repeat for the other flap.







, Cut two short strips of duct tape, then cut each one in half. Fold the tape over the corners. You can match them up with the top and bottom bindings, or you can set them down at an angle.







, Your book is now ready to use!

Fold the overlap around the front cover of the book.,
Fold the overlap around the back cover of the book.,
Stop if the cover fits snugly.,
Decorate your book cover, if you like.",How to Create a Paper Bag Book Cover2," Make a crease along the bottom cover. You can use double-sided tape to secure the fold, if you wish. This will help secure the cover.







, Wrap the paper up across the top of the book. Make a crease along the top cover. Again, feel free to use tape to hold the fold in place. Then, remove the book from the paper.









Measure the folds. They should be at least 1.6 in (4 cm) in length., You should have a strip of paper big enough to cover the book from top to bottom.









Try not to create new folds on top of preexisting folds in the paper. This will cause your book cover to tear more easily., Wrap the paper across the front of the book from left to right and adjust the book position until the two ends of the paper are even.







, Make a crease. Then insert the front cover of the book into the slot created by the paper folded over at the top and the bottom. Slide the paper over the book until you hit the crease.








, Make a crease. Then insert the back cover of the book into the slot created by the paper folded over at the top and the bottom. Slide the paper over the book until you hit the crease.







, If it seems a little loose or the top and bottom folds are not lying flat, you can use small pieces of tape to pull the front and the inside flap together a little more securely.









Do not tape the paper cover to the actual cover of the book; the paper cover will move a little when the book opens, and you could damage the book cover., Remove the book and add stickers, drawings, or designs to the paper. You can add a name tag, or use fancy fonts or scripts to write the title of the book. You can make designs out of paper and attach them with rubber cement or double-sided tape. When you are finished, put the cover back on the book.

Slip the cover back onto the book.",How to Make a Duct Tape Book Cover2," Get a paper grocery bag and cut down one of the corners to the bottom. Cut out the bottom panel and discard it. Pull off the handles and discard them as well. When you are done, you should have a long rectangle.









This method works best for text books.
If this is for a smaller book, you can use a paper lunch bag or even a sheet of brown craft paper. Make sure that it is wider than your opened book.

, Set your text book down next to the bag. Fold the top and bottom edges of the bag until it is the same height as your book.









You can tape these flaps down or cut them off.
You will be covering the bag with duct tape. It does not matter which side is facing up.

, The bag will be much wider than the book, which is good. Make sure that there are equal amounts of paper bag to either side of the book.








, Fold the paper bag over the back cover. Make a crease, then turn all of the pages to the right. Fold the paper bag over the front cover and make another crease.









If the paper bag flaps get in the way of the binding, trim them back a little. It's okay if they touch the binding, but they shouldn't squash against it.
Keep your book open with the inside of the front cover visible.

, Aim to make them 2 to 4 inches (5.08 to 10.16 centimeters) taller than your book. You will be wrapping them around the top and bottom edges of your book cover.









You can use solid-colored duct tape or patterned duct tape.

, Align the edge of the duct tape with the inside edge of the flap. Make sure that there are equal amounts of duct tape sticking over the top and bottom edge of the book cover.








, Simply push the top and bottom duct tape flaps down onto the front of the text book. Do not trim them off. They are what holds the flaps in place!








, Overlap each strip slightly and fold the excess tape over the top and bottom edges.







, If your last strip extends past the edge of the cover, fold it over onto the front cover, then trim off the excess tape at the top and bottom. If your last strip is even with the edge of the cover, lay down another strip of tape so that it extends past the side edge of the cover. Fold the excess back onto the front of the cover. Trim off any extra at the top and bottom. This will make your cover stronger and prevent wear and tear.








, Turn all of the pages to the left so that the inside back cover is visible. Tear off more strips of duct tape. Lay them down across the back flap, overlapping each one slightly. Fold the excess tape over the top and bottom edges of the cover. Remember to bind the side edge!








, You may have to bend the covers back slightly in order to pull the cover off. Set the book aside when you are done.








, Lay down a strip of duct tape along the left and right edges first. Make sure that they are aligned and don't extend past the edge. Fold the excess tape over the top and bottom edges of the cover.








, Use the same method as you did for the side flaps. Remember to overlap each piece of tape slightly.For a more professional touch, work your way inward from the left and right side. Finish by laying down a strip of duct tape along the center, right where the spine is.








, There is a chance that the duct tape at the front covered the inside edges of the flaps. This will prevent them from opening all the way. Flip the cover so that the inside is visible. Look at the left and right flaps. If the tape is right over the inside edge, cut a slit into it so that you can open the flap all the way.








, Your text book is now ready to use!

Write your name and year/grade.,
Draw on the paper.,
Repeat on the back.,
Decorate the inside, too.,
Don't forget the important stuff!",How to Decorate a School Planner1," You will need a couple of sheets of paper, a scissors, a glue stick and some colored pencils, pens or markers.;
, You can cut it down to a smaller size first, or allow it to cover the entire front of your planner. Use a generous amount of glue to stick it in place, otherwise it will come loose.

, Write ______'s School Planner, Year __ in bright colors on the sheet of paper you just stuck to the planner. This will be helpful in case you lose it.

, Around your name, doodle anything that appeals to you, i.e stars, smiley faces, cartoon characters, footballs, books, hearts, animals, etc. If you like, you can stick some stickers in the empty spaces.

, With your other sheet of paper, do the same, but on the back.

, On the first sheet of paper inside, write the date and stick down a sticker. Draw inside, for example, a picture of your school, you, your best friend, your teacher or headmaster.

, Continue doing so on each page, but actually write down the important things, like your timetable, what homework you've got and any clubs you're going to!

Doodle around any free spaces in your notebook.",How to Decorate Your Notebook1," Choose a paper that is shaped like a small rectangle that fits the size of your notebook, and reinforce it with cardboard for durability. You can write not only your name, but the subject of your class, and your roll number, or any other relevant information. Once you've filled out the card, you can glue the paper to the front of the notebook -- ordinary glue or a glue-stick will do. Also use sticky notes for easy notebook organisation. Just write the subject and stick the sticky note on the side of the book. Do this to all your books. Now it looks so much more organised and fancier!


After you glue down the paper, smooth it down to avoid any bumps. If it's too bumpy, then react quickly and take the paper off before it sticks down properly and re-glue it.;
, You can use pictures of animals, pictures from comic strips, or even pictures of your favorite celebrities. You can cover as much of the notebook as you like, as long as you don't cover the card with your name on it. This is all about personalizing the notebook -- choose the pictures that appeal to you.

, Place the stickers in any empty parts of your notebook. You can also partially cover the pictures you've glued onto the notebook, if you like, for a layered effect. 3D stickers also make it look really awesome-but don't use them if you don't want to. Just don't cover the index card with the stickers. You can also make your own stickers and put them on your notebook.

, Find a lacy, beautiful fabric and and glue it around the border of the index card. This will give your notebook a more elegant look. Some stronger glue will be best for this purpose, such as craft bond tacky glue, or craft bond fabric and paper glue. You can even decorate the fabric with glitter.

, If you haven't covered your notebook completely, you can use the same color marker you used for the index card to draw small designs on the notebook, such as hearts, stars, lips, or flowers. And if you get bored with your new notebook, you can always add more layers to it.

Choose your transfers.,
Apply the transfers.",How to Decorate a School Planner2," Rub-on transfers are a great option for decorating a school planner.


They come in a wide range of designs, are easy to apply and can quickly be removed if you ever change your mind.
Look in craft stores or online for a packet of rub-on transfers that suits your style -- you can find butterflies, cowboys, flowers, animals, stars -- nearly anything you can think of!

, Peel off the backing and apply each design to your school planner, in whatever position you like.


Take a wooden lollipop stick and use it to smooth out the surface of the transfer -- this will help it to stick more securely.
If you get sick of these transfers at any stage, you can simply peel them off and reapply a new design -- simple!

Cover this stripe with a different color of glitter.,
Repeat these steps until you've covered the notebook with glitter.,
Add a second layer of Mod Podge and glitter to the notebook.,
Add white paint to make the stripes stand out more.",How to Decorate Your Notebook2," This type of glue and sealer is perfect for securing glitter to your notebook. To cover your notebook in glittered horizontal stripes, you'll need to brush on the Mod Podge for one stripe, cover it with your desired color, and then do the process again for another color. If you brush all of it on at once, the glitter won't stay within the confines of the stripes and will spill everywhere. Use a sponge brush to apply the Mod Podge.You can adjust the size of the stripe to the size of your notebook. You should have at least five stripes on the notebook, so you can make them a bit thicker or thinner so they cover the notebook evenly.

, Choose one color of glitter and sprinkle it on to the stripe. You can smooth down the glitter with your fingers, and shake off any excess glitter. For best results, wait a minute or two for this layer to dry.

, Once you've created the first glittery stripe, make another stripe of glue below it.

, Do exactly what you did with the first color of glitter, except use a new color that will nicely contrast with the first. For example, you can use blue and yellow, green and red, or silver and gold.

, Continue adding a stripe of Mod Podge followed by a stripe of glitter to the notebook until you've covered the notebook with colors of alternating glittery stripes.

, Once you've covered your notebook with the stripes, brush another layer of Mod Podge over the first stripe, cover it in glitter, and then repeat this process with each stripe until you've covered the whole notebook with a second layer of stripes. This will make the glitter stick to the notebook even more.

, To emphasize the contrasting stripes, use a thin brush to add a layer of white paint around the stripes. This will make the colors ""pop"" more and will complete your original glittery notebook. If you've chosen very light colors, like yellow and baby blue, you can think about using a Gray or darker color to emphasize them instead of white.

Trim the fabric around the book cover.",How to Decorate Your Notebook3," Find an old t-shirt with a fun design or logo. You will cover your notebook with this shirt, so pick something that is fun, eye-catching, and a shirt that you don't wear any more but can't bring yourself to throw out-just make sure that the design is small enough to fit on your notebook and not too big so that you can't see it, and not to small so that it looks tiny on the notebook.http:, Put it over the logo or design you'd like to put on the cover of the notebook. Open the notebook so that the pages are facing you.

, This will help you know where to cut the t-shirt. If you cut it too close to the size of the notebook, it may end up being too small.

, Now use scissors to cut the outline of the t-shirt. This t-shirt will cover the front and back of the notebook.

, This will prepare you for sticking the t-shirt fabric onto the front of the notebook.

, Use a Popsicle stick to spread the glue all over the front cover of the notebook. Make sure to reach the edges of the notebook with the glue without covering any of the pages. You can also use a sponge brush to apply the glue. Tacky glue will work best for adhering the t-shirt to the cover of the notebook.

, Gently glide along the t-shirt with your hand and make sure that it sticks evenly to the glue, avoiding any bumps. The part of the shirt that you'll be using for the back cover will remain untouched.

, Do the same thing you did to cover the front with the tacky glue.

, Do what you did to the front side -- just take the second half of the t-shirt and press it into the back of the notebook. Then, you should wait for the notebook to dry. You can even press it between heavy books or boxes to keep it flat and to avoid any bumps that could appear under the t-shirt.

, Since you left extra room when you cut the fabric of the t-shirt, you'll have some extra fabric left over. Just cut the extra fabric with a thin and sharp pair of scissors, and touch up any parts of the t-shirt that may not have stuck to the notebook evenly with glue.

Who compliments your clothing/accessories more, younger girls or girls your age?,
Signature scent.",How to Be the Most Wanted Girl in Class1," Keep it clean, healthy, and good-smelling. Quality products include Pantene, TreSemme, Garnier, and Bumble and Bumble, but you should use whatever works for you. Some good hairstyle ideas include:
, Brush your teeth thoroughly and use mouthwash. Shower once or twice a day, but before you step into the tub, shave your arms, legs, and underarms. Body hair can hold onto bacteria, causing odor when you sweat, not to mention it doesn't look all that hot.

, Drink plenty of water, eat fruits and veggies, and always get a good night's sleep.

, Unless you're ambidexterous, don't paint your nails by yourself. Have a friend do it for you, or go to a salon. If you have a habit of biting your nails, or they just wouldn't look good enough with nail polish, get artificial nails. You can never go wrong with a classic French tip, but don't be afraid to experiment with bright colors and fun patterns.

, It has both a purpose and a secret. The purpose of makeup is to enhance your best features, not cover them up. And the secret to wearing makeup is to make it look like you're NOT wearing makeup. Sounds impossible, right? Well for example, if you don't love your eyebrows you can just trim them and use an eyebrow pencil to correct them. Remember, don't make it obvious that you're wearing makeup. Save the eyeshadow for formal school functions.

, Before resorting to commercial products like Proactiv and Epiduo, wash your face everyday with soap and hot (NOT scalding!!!) water, rinse with cold water, exfoliate, and use lotion. Do this everyday until you see results.

, If you said younger girls, then consider updating your wardrobe. While it is much more important to get what you like, you should also find out the top five most popular brands in your school, and get the hottest things that each brand has. Mind you, not everything has to be expensive, or even well-known. As the lady in the ShoeDazzle commercial said, stay one step ahead; make everyone think you know something they don't. The best way to pull this off is to shop online. Good sites include Choies, TBDress, and YESSTYLE.

, Guys absolutely love the smell of vanilla, but you should have a variety including flowers and fruit. Bath and Body Works, Victoria's Secret, and The Body Shop should be your go-to stores.

Make a space for hygiene items.",How to Make Your Locker Useful and Decorative," If it's brand new, you are very lucky! New lockers are the best. No mess, no fuss, no worry over what there is to throw out and what not.;
, Items such as locker shelves and magazine racks are perfect for spaces as small as a locker. Organize your exercise/ text books, worksheets, loose papers and novels into your shelf or magazine rack.

,


For a metal locker buy magnets. These can help keep with important notes and reminders, but also are great for attaching images and photos of your friends, favorite band and favorite quotes. If you want, you can buy post-its, too.
For a wooden locker buy Blu-Tack or any adhesive such as Blu-Tack. Push pins also work but can damage the locker.

, The taller holder can carry spare pens, pencils and such, while the smaller one can hold spare hair ties, bobby pins, chap-sticks/lipgloss, safety pins, bracelets and other jewelry.

, This requires a white board marker and duster. If you do this, you need to buy a sleeve or bag to keep your duster in because it can become exceedingly dirty, ruining your locker. This also applies to chalk. However chalk can become powder and ruin your locker.

, If your school doesn't have a uniform policy, you can keep extra clothes in your locker in case they asked you to change your clothes, or you dirty the ones you are currently wearing.

, Hygiene is also important. Make sure you have a space to keep hand sanitizer, talcum powder (can be used to keep the underarms soft after PE), antiperspirant or fragranced deodorant, breath mints or gum, essentials for that time of the month (pads and/or tampons) and lotion.

For example, if you're 13, you probably shouldn't be wearing bunny tops and old leggings, but instead going for cool stuff that looks trendy and suits you! Be careful not to dress older than your age and show skin, as you will be judged.

The most important thing for all fabulous school girls to have, is the perfect figure. This doesn't mean barfing out all that spaghetti you just had for dinner, it simply means working out and playing outside enough to burn off the excess calories you consume, if any. Both we working out and playing outside, by the way, also boost your confidence and social skills. Not to mention, giving you a chance to meet new people!);
, Choose swimming, dancing, playing basketball, tennis soccer...anything physical. Devote an hour to this, about four times a week and do this every week to keep in shape. Added bonus-you get that glossy hair and that fresh-faced look which every girl would kill for!

Clothes. The word that makes you wonder WHY you dragged your butt out of the bed in the morning at all. Relax. Your drab and dull wardrobe, your squinty eyes, and that horrid nest-like structure you pass off as hair...all deserve an entire day to themselves. We all know the big teen brand Fabulous School Girl brand names (not to be confused with Designer) Abercrombie and Fitch, Levi's, United Colors of Benetton, H&M and similar stores wear you live, remember, that's for everyday wear. Every diva should have at least a few designers dresses stashed away for the glamour nights. Keep it simple and don't try to hard too impress. The girl on MTV with a top ending around her waist, with saggy undies below that? Lame and way out of the question for you or any other Fabulous School Girl.

, This is a must-get for any girl wanting to reinvent her life for the better. Don't ever ditch your true friends. When you're down and lonely, let them always be the ones you turn to first, and be loyal to them. Save the politics for the rest.

, Maybe you don't think your old friends weren't that bad, but if they honestly ever made you feel half as fabulous as you truly are, you wouldn't be reading this article in the first place, would you?

, Know your enemies too, especially if they're conniving, manipulative freaks who've never done anyone any good. Don't hang out with them- that will just arouse suspicion. Find common friends (if any) and dig up some dirt on those girls. Don't manipulate them just yet- it's always good to have something up your pretty sleeve.

, When one of those girls tries to make fun of you at first (by the time we're though,they'd barely have the guts to look you in the eye) simply laugh. Say something like 'why am I the only one laughing? Oh right,'cause you're THAT lame.' That should shut her up.

, Don't EVER be seen standing still with your mouth agape. Get sarcastic with people, and then flash a glossy smile.They'll never know what hit them.

, Feel free to manipulate those particular friends if you want. It's your group, honey, you rule it.

, Don't obsess over the fact that some random guy thinks another girl is cuter than you. It's his choice, but really why give a damn? You don't wanna go out with someone who dares to compare you with some other chick, do you?

, This should be easy with those stellar good looks now. Flirt at school, at the gym, at stuffy art galleries (only if the artist in question looks like Neal Caffrey from White Collar. Popular girls set the standards) Don't flirt with people you don't like though. You'll come off as being too desperate.

, Fabulous girls are different from the totally replaceable queen bees, in that they're individuals, and they're awesome. They are never scared of sliding into ghastly dork-dom in case someone ever found out that they were smart. They know what they want and will go far in life.Your grades are a reflection of you. Don't let yourself down.

, Don't get bogged down by the idiots who say that the things you like aren't cool. If it involves getting up and showing a talent of yours, it's cool and you know it.

, Don't make eye contact with people in the hall that you don't care about. Don't stick your nose in the air either. If anyone asks where you've been, smile, slightly tilt your head and say 'nothing you'd know about.'

",How to Be the Coolest Girl in School," In 10 years it won't matter what stores you shopped at, what makeup you wore, and so on. Be kind to the people around you, have a sense of humor and radiate confidence and beauty. Appearance matters but it is not everything. If you are charming, kind and energetic people will want to be with you no matter what. ""A rich man never knows who his true friends are."" Same applies in this case. If clothing defines you, you are plastic.;
, This can be your starting point.

, Make sure you have a rather fashionable bag or coat, or both if you like. But you don't need to spend loads of money or people may just think your too rich and snobby, don't overdo it. If you think your bag is old, customize it by adding a few key rings. Vera Bradley bags or Miss Me jeans are good for that cool girl style!

, Straight hair is in but you don't have to get up at 5am every morning, as most people don't have time. Just try out a cute hairstyle that all the girls will want to copy!

, Only talk about things that are relevant in a conversation. Basically, if your friends are talking about shopping, don't come out with a random story of how you got soaked on you way to school, or you fell down the stairs. Practice a cool walk until you know it by heart. And, if people are calling you a loser, speak up a bit more and have CONFIDENCE talking to people!

,, Try new perfumes to pick which one fits your style!

, If you THINK sexy. Others will to. Be confident.

, It is important to let others have their say. This will make people want to talk to you, and you will have more friends. You must be good at keeping secrets!

Tie it all together and bam!",How to Be the Hottest Person at School," Go to Walmart and buy some good-quality shampoo and conditioner for your hair. Wash your hair like this: Wet your hair with warm or lukewarm water for 40 seconds in the shower. Next, apply the shampoo to your hair and wash from your scalp to ends. Rinse with warm water. Do the same with the conditioner, but rinse your hair with cold water once you're finished. Style as desired.;
, Every day, you should soak them in coconut or olive oil. Microwave some for 25 seconds and soak your nails for 5 minutes with the oil. Pat them dry. If you do this daily, by the end of the month, your nails will be longer and stronger! You can paint them if you want, too. Paint them vibrant, bold colors or dark, neutral colors. Maybe even a mixture of both! Do the same with your toenails, too.

, For your face, wash it two times a day with a bar of soap and warm water. Use a moisturizing lotion afterwards. For your body, use an all-natural soap that smells nice and works well on your skin. To see if a skin product works on your skin, apply some to your wrist and wait 24 hours. If nothing happens to your wrist, you can use that product. If not, try something else for your body or face.

, Here's how you can do that: Every morning and night, take a toothbrush and put lotion on it. Rub the bristles on your lips until everything transfers from your toothbrush to your lips. Get a towel and wet it with warm water. Wipe the lotion off with the towel and apply a Chapstick Classic. They're unscented, so that way you don't lick your lips, trying to taste your lip balm. After a month of doing this, your lips will be as soft and smooth as silk.

, Brush them two times a day: In the morning and in the evening. Use a floride-enriched toothpaste and a good-quality toothbrush. You can use mouthwash, too. I recommend Listerine Cool Mint Mouthwash. It's fresh. clean, and helps your teeth, gums, and tongue a lot more than you think. Also, remember to brush your gums, the backs of your teeth and in between each tooth. Get a new toothbrush every 3-4 months, since it will probably be worn out from all that brushing.

, Don't be a clone and copy what the models are wearing on the runway! Mix what those models wear with what you like to wear. Models are wearing kitten heels? You like skirts? Wear a plain shirt, a knee-length black skirt, and black kitten heels. Models are wearing tank tops? You like Converse sneakers? Wear a tank top in your favorite color, jeans or shorts, and Converse sneakers.

, First, you have to ask your parents first if you're under the age of 13 or if you haven't asked them yet. If your parents say yes, keep it subtle. Wear pencil eyeliner, light eyeshadow, pink blush and lip gloss. If your parents say no, just keep a Chapstick around with you.

, Nobody likes someone that is rude and is selfish. Help other people, join a community service group, use kind words and never use bad ones. People will see the kindness and generosity in you and will reward you for it.

, Study hard, do extra credit if your teacher allows it, and never think that you can't get a good grade. If you get bad grades, you could get grounded, called dumb by most people that find out about your grades, and won't make you seem hot at all. Always get good grades, no matter what.

, You're hot!

Do your best.",How to Be Social at School," You have heard it a billion times. But take this seriously! No one really likes the mean popular girls. They're just scared of such girls. You don't have to be mean to be popular. Being mean doesn’t solve anything. Make sure you are kind to everyone, that would work better! Also try to be social at the same time. It will make others happy, and it will make you happier.
, Give out your phone number, e-mail, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, whatever you have and would like to give out! This way, people can chat with you and see how you act. However, try to only give your contact information to people you know, not random strangers. Giving out personal details to strangers is unsafe and dangerous., Become social as slowly as you want, but the process needs to be steady. You can say just 'hello!' to people you know and happen to see. After some days, you can start short talks with people. Only when you are sure you're confident enough, you can join a club; invite lots of friends over, etc. Forcing yourself into social situations won't help. Just keep this process gradual. Remember, you won't be from super shy to social butterfly all of a sudden. It takes time and effort., Hygiene plays an important role in your social life. Proper hygiene is one of the keys to be healthier and happier. This helps you to make friends and keep them. It also builds your confidence and will make you more enjoyable to be around. By taking regular care of your body, you can feel great and be healthier without much time and effort. These simple habits and hygiene acts will keep you clean, fit, and healthy every day.

Eat a balanced diet
keep yourself clean,
brush your teeth,
shower daily and
dress up neatly.

, Confidence, too, plays an important role in your social life. If you are confident, you can be social. Being confident may seem a bit tricky; but actually, it is not. The good news is that, feeling good about yourself, is only up to you! Even if you get embarrassed, everyone will forget that embarrassment in a couple of days. Later on, you'll feel better that you showed up to talk to someone!, Judging others, especially judgements like giving bad judgement to one friend and good to another; is WRONG. It will cause a lot of trouble, which will drift you back to your previous situation, shyness. But, if anyone insists you to judge a person or number of people, don't judge them. Rather say they all are equally good. Do not judge even mischievous people. If you are asked to judge him/her, just say, ""Well, I don't like his/her behaviour."" Remember that if you say this, you are judging the behaviour and not the person. This is exactly what you have to do., People may gossip about the shy you. If you socialise, their gossiping may decrease. Don't trust any one completely. Avoid telling personal issues, if you don't want to look insecure. There may be a few episodes in the past when you trusted someone completely, and later on, everyone and even the person you had trusted made fun of you. This may be a reason why you're shy. Think about it. Also, when someone trusts you, keep them secure and do not make fun of them, ever. Encourage them to be social slowly but steadily, if they are shy just like you were.,

Speak least to strangers/bullies.
Speak a little more to people that belong to your class.
Speak more to people who are in your class, whom you know well.
Speak the most with your best friend.

, A good friend probably won't ask the reason why you became social, but, if he/she does, just say, ""I was just bored."" or ""How about having some friends?"" or ""So you think I'll remain the same forever, huh?"" But, if a bully asks you the same question then say firmly, ""Mind your own business!"", It will take time and patience. Don't force yourself into social situations. Increase the level of socialising with increasing confidence. Till then, short talks would be a good start. All the best!"

Wrapping paper: Re-use the wrapping from presents. Most people like to use wrapping paper that is not obviously holiday or birthday related. But you can often use the non-printed side of the wrapping paper for covering the book, and decorate as you prefer.
Old calendars often feature beautiful artwork.
Menus. How cute would it be to have a Chinese take-out menu as your book-cover?
Magazines. Be a little careful in your use, as you do not want your math teacher to think you are reading a fashion magazine in class!
Ask local stores or workplaces for unwanted paper.Very often, there are office supplies gathering dust on shelves or in cabinets that they would be pleased to give away.

, (The instructions will work with other materials besides paper bags.)


Old manila folders make excellent book covers and are often plentiful in office settings.

, If you can get hold of rice paper, it is strong, biodegradable, and even edible!

, Be sure to label your school books prominently on the front and the spine.—When you're racing to class it should be clear which book to grab.

, Write your name, school name, and school address somewhere on the book cover. (Do not put personal information like phone number, e-mail address, or home address.) If you lose your book, this will provide a chance for a helpful person to get the book back to you.

Get enough paper to cover your book in a single sheet.,
Trim the paper so that it's slightly bigger than the book.,
Cut wedge-shaped slits next to the spine.,
Fold in the edges.,
Close the book and repeat for the other cover.,
Decorate your cover!,
Label Your Textbook.",How to Cover a Textbook1," With this method, we'll use a sheet of paper to give our textbook a quick, easy, and affordable cover. To start, lay your paper on a flat surface, then open the book and lay it cover-down on the paper. The paper should extend beyond the book's edges. If it doesn't, your paper isn't big enough.


There are a wide variety of papers that are suitable for your cover. In general, thicker papers (such as construction paper) will provide the most protection, though decorative papers (such as wrapping paper) can be more visually appealing. (Later in the article there will be a discussion on how to decorate and strengthen paper covers.)
You can also use materials that are paper-like, such as wallpaper, Tyvek (often used for packaging), and duct tape (see below in the article).;
, Using a ruler, cut the paper so that it extends one to two inches or so to past long edges and about two to three inches past the short edges. This gives the cover enough material to stay seated around the book, but not so much that it will be awkward to work with., The ""spine"" is the hard part of the book in the middle of the cover where all the pages meet. Make two wedge- or triangle-shaped cuts in the middle of the long edges of your paper sheet that stretch to the edge of the book. These cuts should line up with both ends of the book's spine.


If you don't do this, you will run into problems in the next step when you fold the extra paper material over the edges of the cover. It is physically impossible to fold the paper over the pages themselves, so your paper cover will scrunch and eventually tear as you open and close the book.

, Pick either the front or back cover of your book to start making your cover. First, fold the longer edges of your paper over the book's cover so that they sit against it reasonably tight. Then, fold the four corners of the paper in so that they're aligned with the edges of the folds you just made. Finally, fold the shorter edge of your paper in to complete the cover.


Use pieces of tape to hold your work together as you go and to secure the cover once you are done folding.

, When you have finished taping one side of your new cover, close the book to hold it in place, open the opposite cover, and repeat the folding procedure exactly as above. Tape each fold as you go.


Congratulations! Your book cover is now complete. Anything you do to your cover after this point is completely optional.

One thing you may want to experiment with is laying a strip of tape along the spine while the book is closed. Generally, the spine is the part of the cover that receives the most wear, so protecting this with tape can prevent it from wearing out prematurely.
Taping the corners likewise helps eliminate a common wear point. It also has the advantage of making the cover stay on more securely to the book.


Sturdy tapes like packing tape or duct tape are best, though layered scotch or masking tape can work surprisingly well.







, Before taking your textbook to class, you may want to spruce up your plain, old boring cover. How you do this is up to you — as long as whatever you choose doesn't mark or damage your book, it's probably fair game. Below are just a few ideas — feel free to go wild with your own.


Drawings and doodles (take care not to use pens or markers that bleed through your cover)
Stickers
Duct tape designs
Negative-space designs (i.e., cutting some of the cover out in a decorative shape)
Cut-outs from magazines, advertisements, etc. Just cut and paste.

, Label your textbook on both the front and on the spine. Make each book cover distinctive in some way, such as different colors, decorations, or however works for you. When you are in a hurry, it is easy to confuse one textbook with another in your locker, backpack, or at home.

Include a way of reaching you if the book is lost, such as your school, a phone number or e-mail. If you leave your textbook somewhere, it is more likely to get to you or the school if the do-gooder who finds it can know how to get it to you.
Just be sure not to include any sensitive identifying information like an address or a student ID number.

Cover with cloth.",How to Cover School Books Using Biodegradable Materials2," In the old days, it was commonplace for people to cover their books with cloth. Cloth covering is not only biodegradable but serves as excellent cover protector - antiquarian books can be purchased today which are largely intact still thanks to cloth covers having been lovingly added many decades before. It's also a very sophisticated statement for book lovers. Covering a book with cloth requires basic knowledge of stitching, as you will need to sew up the corners:


Cut the fabric about 2.5""/5 centimeter (2.0 in) larger than the book.
Fold around the edges of the book into the inner cover.
Keep in place using sewing pins or safety pins.
Test for fit. The cover shouldn't prevent the book from closing neatly, nor should the cover billow out with excess fabric. Adjust until the fit is good.
Trim the area around the spine so that the cover fits snugly. Trim any excess fabric areas. There shouldn't be an excess of fabric inside the book cover - aim for regularity of width.
Stitch the cover together. Use a little glue to adhere the corners to the book cardboard after stitching if the book is yours; if it is a borrowed text, skip this step - the cloth will stay in place provided you handle the book carefully. Finish off neatly.
Discard the fabric if you need to return the book. The fabric can be reused or composted, depending on its origin.

"
"
Don't cover your books.",How to Cover School Books Using Biodegradable Materials3," (If that is a choice in your school) Students who don't cover their books take other precautions to care for their books. Some strategies:


Take good care of the covers - carry books carefully in your bag, making sure not to scrunch them, or to bend back covers when pushing them in.
Don't leave books sitting next to items that can cause stains, such as your lunch, ink, or markers with loose lids.
Leave books at home or at school/college where possible (this also helps to prevent back strain caused by carrying too many books)!
Carry your books by hand; use string or a strap to tie them into a neat bundle with a carry loop.
Make or purchase a durable book bag to carry books separately from other items. A book bag is also handy for slipping in between other items in a bag while still protecting your books.

Obtain Kraft paper.,
Cut the bag into a single sheet.,
Fold your cover as you would for a normal sheet of paper.",How to Cover a Textbook2," The go-to material is the thick, brown paper called Kraft paper. This is what paper bags like the kind you might get at the supermarket is made from. Kraft paper is available on rolls anywhere shipping supplies are sold, and it is a little easier to work with. However, obviously that paper is not free.


Make sure your bag is large enough to cover both sides of your book before beginning.

, Start by cutting out the bottom of the bag along its folds and removing any handles if your bag has them. Make a single vertical cut along one of the bag's corners. Your bag should now look like a single, rectangular sheet of paper.

, Now that you have more or less turned your paper bag into a single sheet of paper, the rest of the process is easy. Just follow the steps in the section above, using your cut-up paper bag in place of the sheet of paper specified.


Ignore the folds that may remain in the sheet of paper you have cut from your paper bag — make your own folds.
Ironing the paper on medium heat on an iron can get rid of any fold marks that may confuse you, or just make a really nice, tidy piece of paper.

Lay down a single strip of tape sticky side up.,
Lay a strip of tape on the top sticky side down.,
Fold the first strip of tape over.,
Flip over and repeat.,
Continue this pattern until you have a ""sheet"" larger than your book.,
Trim your ""sheet"" into an even rectangle.,
Cut wedge-shaped holes for the book's spine.,
Mark the folding lines for your duct tape cover.,
Press these creases.,
Tape the cover around your book.,
Optionally, decorate your cover.",How to Cover a Textbook3," In terms of long-term durability, it's hard to beat a textbook cover made entirely from duct tape.

However, since sticking duct tape directly to the textbook can be quite damaging in its own right, before starting, you'll need to make a ""sheet"" of duct tape material that's non-sticky on both sides. This isn't as hard as it sounds, though it can be somewhat time-consuming. To begin, pull a single long strip of tape and lay it on your work area face-up.Your strip of tape should be about three to six inches longer than your book is in height. In the rest of this section, you will want to use tape strips that are roughly the same length as your first, but keep in mind they don't need to be exactly the same.

, Take a second strip of tape and very carefully lay it sticky side down on top of the first so that it covers about half of the first piece. Press it down so that there are no wrinkles.

, Take your first piece of tape (the one that is sticky side up) and fold it over the top of the second, pressing it down to get a clean and even fold. This now forms one ""edge"" of your sheet — you will continue to lay down more tape in the opposite direction.

, Lay down a third strip of tape on the tape that's now sticky side up. Be sure not to leave any gaps where sticky adhesive can be be seen — if these get pressed against your book cover, they can cause it to tear.


You may even want to overlap your tape slightly to make sure that no stickiness shows through.

, Keep flipping your tape and laying down new strips. Before long, you should have a ""sheet"" that's sticky side down on both sides. Once this sheet is big enough to leave a few inches on every side of your book, make your second edge by folding the final piece of tape back over itself to conceal the sticky part.

, Open your book and lay it cover side down on your sheet. Use a ruler to mark straight lines along the edges of your sheet that cut off all the mismatched tape ends. Use a pair of scissors, a razor blade, or an X-ACTO knife to cut along these lines.


When you're done, you should have a sheet that's perfectly rectangular (and still extends beyond the edges of your book by a few inches on each side).

, Compared to making your duct tape sheet, the rest of your work is easy. Start by opening your book and laying it cover side down on your duct tape sheet. Use diagonal cuts to cut out a small wedge-shaped piece above and below the book's spine. When you're done, there should be small gaps at the top and bottom of the sheet that line up with the book's spine.


This is done for the same reason as in the paper method above — without this, opening the book puts stress on the portion of the cover next to the spine, causing it to fold awkwardly and eventually wear.

, Fold the short edges over the book's covers and mark the lines where the sheet folds. Repeat this folding-and-marking process for the long edges.

, Remove the book from the sheet. Refold your sheet along the lines you just drew. Press the folds down to make strong creases. Lay a heavy object (such as your textbook) on top of each crease for a few minutes to flatten the folds.

, Once you have got nice, flat creases, put your book back onto your sheet and fold the cover around it, folding the long edges of the sheet around the cover first and then folding the short edges over with diagonal folds. Use skinny strips of duct tape to secure each fold.

, Congratulations — your cover is done and you can decorate it however you like. While pens and markers won't show up well on dark-colored duct tape, you can still try making designs with different colors of tape, adding adhesive decorations (like rhinestones), and so on.


As advised above, label your textbooks and make it easy for a lost book to find you.

You may also want to try laying strips of white masking tape down on the front cover and spine to use as labels. This is a good idea for keeping track of the subject of each book.

Dress. Wear your uniform smartly. If the school follows a uniform, then wear it neatly by ironing the uniform and polishing the shoes, etc.
Hair. Don't go overboard with the hairstyles. Opt for a simple ponytail or free hair. If you're a boy, wear neat or interesting hair.
Shoes. Wear sensible and comfortable shoes that ensure you stay on your feet without tripping.
Bag. It's just the first day so you won't be needing too many of things.Let it be new (if affordable) or clean.;
, Clean your face twice a day and exfoliate once a week. This will give you clear skin. Wear makeup if you feel like you have to but keep it natural. If not needed don't wear any makeup; natural beauty is much more admired than fake beauty.

Make sure your hair is always perfect, wash it every three days and don't forget to take it easy on the heat tools. These can damage your hair making it dry and have split ends. If you do though, use heat protection products.
Eat fruit and veg to have glowing skin and drink up to 5 glasses of water a day.
Brush your teeth twice a day with a manual toothbrush and good toothpaste. If you have bad breath, you may want to ask your dentist about what mouthwash is required. However, your bad breath may be because you haven't cleaned your tongue in a while. Scrape off the debris (white stuff) to clean your tongue.
Shower every day with a bodywash that smells good! Wash your hair once every three days.
Clean your face twice a day with ordinary moisturising soap and exfoliate once a week.

, Pumping up your look (haircut, highlights, new clothes and accessories, etc.), will help later on.

, A calm but big smile can do a lot. It makes you look more attractive, it makes you more approachable and makes you look kind! If your teeth are yellow invest in better toothpastes and keep the smile to a minimum. However, don't smile all the time; you'll look like a freak., On your first day, or any day, posture is important. If you walk into school all hunched up looking at the ground you will never be noticed and people won't speak to you. Although if you walk in shoulders back head up you'll look confident, and approachable. And you'll look as if you rule the school! So keep the shoulders back and the head up. Even if your day had a bad start!, Work hard on speaking clearly and with flair. Use clever and interesting words and phrases, to sound smarter than the rest.

, Smile at people and wave, introduce yourself and be confident. This is a great way to make friends and show people that you're not afraid to say hi to new people. Already you will look like you're the person people want to be friends with; because you are. You see it's everyone's first day, they know hardly anyone (maybe people from their old school), so what do they want to do? Make friends! They don't know what to do since it's their first day, so they want a leader. Even though you don't know anything, just wing it. So act confident when introducing yourself. Do this to everyone and you will be their leader, and be kind., Maybe you met some people at your induction day who you want to meet up with before school. Maybe you are walking/getting the bus with some people who you already know! It's better to walk in alongside friends. You're a leader, you're perfectly independent; it's just better to have friends to go with.,

, Don't go with silly conversations like ""what class you'll have?"" or ""what do you like doing?""... that's just the usual boring get-to-know-you chit chat that feels awkward... just start to introduce yourself, and tell funny stories about yourself, and talk naturally, so people will see you as a nice person to talk to. Just that.

Avoid sounding haughty, snobby, or proud.",How to Be Popular Without Being Rude," Depending on what type of school you go to, and where your school is located, there are going to be different styles that stay popular with your school, and other styles that don't show up as much. Ask yourself the following questions:


What is different about their style and mine?
How can I change mine subtly so that I don't come off as a copycat or a poser?
Am I wearing a style that might not be labeled as ""popular""?;
, However, while making sure it is slightly similar to the type of style that is accepted as popular, be sure that it doesn't look so similar that people are going to accuse you of copying the popular girl!

, Popular people are always stylish, and they often stick with the clothing that is in style. If you want, you can choose a completely different style that looks amazing, and it'll make you stand out from them. However, be very careful about which style you choose - don't stand out too much (ex: If dark blue jeans are considered hot in style right now at your school, try sporting a pair of black jeans to make you stand out slightly from all those dark blue jeans! However, neon red or pink would not be very acceptable).


It's recommended that you purchase fashion magazines to read and update yourself on the current styles. You can buy clothing similar to the models you see while making sure the clothing suits you well, and is slightly different.

, Accessories are another important part of your style. Pick out cute necklaces, earrings, bracelets, scarves, etc. while bewaring of over-accessorizing. Try not to purchase any accessories similar to what the popular girls wear in your school, but amazing accessories that will make those girls green with envy!


Before you leave the house, always follow the rule for all girls: look in the mirror, and remove one accessory before leaving.

, Do this by adding one clothing piece at a time. While you may be tempted to stride into the school with a burst of new style and color, it would be best for people not to suspect your goal to becoming popular. Subtly morph from your old style to your new one over the following weeks, making sure it isn't too obvious.


For example: Wear your new top one week. Then wear another the next week, and so on. Slowly begin to add new pants, and slowly continue on with everything else till you are fully dressed and striding about in your new style!
Make sure your style would be acceptable in your school, and that you are completely following dress code if your school has one.

, Every popular girl has good hygiene from the top of their head to the tips of their toes, starting with a daily shower! You should shower every single day, even if you don't wash your hair. Use the following every day when you take your shower:


Use a good smelling, strong soap that will completely cleanse your entire body. Make sure it suits your skin type, and that it won't harm you. Refrain from any soaps that use chemicals in it - stick with natural, for natural is the best for your skin in the long run!

If you can't find a scented soap with natural ingredients that suit your body, purchase an unscented soap, and use body lotion to replace the missing fragrance.


Bathe in lukewarm water. Hot water completely strips your skin of all its moisture, for the skin tends to flush in order to get rid of the heat, resulting in possible broken capillaries.
Limit your shower time to under six minutes, as spending too much time soaking in the water will cause your skin to become dry and possibly form rashes.
Exactly fifteen minutes after you take your shower, moisturize your entire body, including the face! This will lock in the moisture in your skin, giving it an extra boost of health and shine. However, be careful not to use too much moisturizer, and be sure it suits your skin type before using.

If your moisturizer is too hard on your face, it can cause pimples to pop up. If this appears to be the case, immediately switch to another moisturizer as soon as possible.



, How often you wash your hair will highly depend on your hair type:


Thick hair - Wash it at least three times a week, for it will get dirty less easily.
Thin hair - Wash it two to three times a week, depending on how easily dirty it gets. Consider experimenting with different shampoos and conditioners to give it more volume if desired.
Oily hair - Wash it every other day. Consider changing your shampoo and/or conditioner to help remove the extra oil and residue.
Dry hair - Wash it three to four times a week, and consider using a different shampoo and/or conditioner to help add moisture.

, The amount of shampoo you should be using is the size of a quarter. For conditioner, it should be the size of a dime. When applying the shampoo to your hair, first lather it in between your palms, then massage it into your scalp, gradually distributing it throughout the rest of your hair. The same goes for conditioner.

, You should wash your face twice a day - morning and night. Use the following tips to ensure you have a flawless (or nearly flawless) complexion:


Have a good cleanser. Making sure that the cleanser fits your skin type and isn't too strong on your face is very important, as the cleanser is supposed to help remove the oil and residue that are clogging your pores. It's also supposed to help fight the pimples forming on your face!

When applying the cleanser, make sure you use just enough for your whole face - not more or less. Gently rub it into your skin, and make sure it's well absorbed before fully rinsing it off with lukewarm water.
If you have a bad cleanser that doesn't help your face at all, immediately stop using it, and search for a better one. You aren't helping your face when you use the wrong cleanser.


While the cleanser opens up the pores, the toner is meant to tighten them and balance your skin tone. Making sure the toner isn't too harsh on your face is important as well.

Using a cotton ball, gently apply the toner to your face, using just enough. Beware of using too little or too much.


Moisturizer, as mentioned earlier, is another key ingredient to the perfect complexion. Gently rubbing in a circular motion, apply just enough to your skin to moisturize it. Make sure not too use too much, or you may find pimples popping up! Be sure to moisturize daily, and whenever your skin feels dry as well.

, Keep in mind that makeup is supposed to add glow to your face, not color. If you find that makeup doesn't entirely suit your face, try different methods to make sure that the glow comes out, not the color!


Foundation, concealer, mascara, lip gloss, eye shadow, and blush are basically what you should use. Although you don't necessarily have to use them all, those usually help hide unpleasing bags, shadows, etc.
If you aren't allowed to wear makeup, chapstick is both acceptable and fine. It's also good for your lips!
Keep in mind that you should never hide a pimple with makeup, as makeup only worsens its condition. Brave it out, or use a facial mask to help get rid of it. However, remember that using too much facial mask may make it worse, or cause more pimples to pop up!

, While you may be tempted to moisten dry lips by given them a quick swipe with your tongue, it only makes it worse. Peeling or yanking at dry bits of loose skin will only inflame your chapped lips, making them worse. The best you can do is try different formulas to bring quick healing to your chapped lips, and apply plenty of chapstick.


A quick method to heal chapped lips overnight is to apply chapstick every night before you go to bed. Then, in the morning, you'll wake up with moisturized lips! Keep applying chapstick throughout the day to lock in the moisture, and repeat this method every night.
Keep a tube of chapstick in your pocket for quick and easy use.

, Avoid sticking to just one group. Flutter from one group to another, and invite those who sit alone to join you! If they are too shy, join them instead, and make sure as many people as possible feel included.

, If it isn't possible to talk face to face with one or more of your friends, text or email them a sweet message to let them know you care for them.

, It's best to not just stick with one group of friends. Instead, have a few circles:


Have one circle of friends you are very close with.
Outside of the circle of close friends, have a circle of normal friends you can talk to and fool around with.
Surrounding the circle of normal friends will be acquaintances, or people you don't normally talk to every single day, but you are friendly with.

, Treat everyone else who isn't your friend (acquaintances) neutrally. Have no bad thoughts or show any bad feelings to anyone. You don't have to treat them too kindly or meanly - just show enough friendliness and kindness to get by. That way, no one can ever say you were mean to them, and people will start looking up to you!


If there is someone you can't stand, treat them neutrally either way. Who says you have to like them to treat them neutrally? Remember that they are a human being like you as well, and consider giving them a chance. Get on good terms with them! Perhaps you got the wrong impression. However, do not ignore the annoying person, or they may get angry at you and try to do something harmful to get back at you. Don't form enemies in the school - that's the last thing you want to do when trying to become popular.
Do not attempt anything that you know will provoke or hurt them. Word might get around, and your chances of becoming popular will shatter.

, However, it's best to stick with just texting in case some people get annoyed with the phone ringing constantly. Overdoing this is not good at all, as people will find you just annoying, and it'll give you a bad reputation.

, Joining clubs and activities is one of the most efficient and popular ways to improve your social status, and get your name around the school! Plus, you can form new bonds while participating in an activity you enjoy.

, If they look intently focused on something, save your hello for later when they're less busy. Interrupting their focus will most likely bother them, and cause them to dislike you, even if you were only trying to be nice and friendly.

, Treat them kindly, but don't be their servant just to please them. Do enough to receive their favor, and in return, they'll be kind to you and maybe do nice things for you as well.


Avoid the snobs. There is nothing you can do to entirely please them, and they'll only look down on you. Go for the kinder popular people.
Know right and wrong from what they ask you to do. If what they're asking you to do is wrong, don't do it just to please them. If your goal is to be a popular person without being rude, stick with it, and earn your popular status by not being rude!

, However, there is no need to be rude when doing this. Simply say something similar to the following:


""I did this because I felt it was best. I'm sorry you disagree.""
""I'm sorry you didn't like what I did, but it was the right thing to me.""
""I'm sorry you didn't like what I did, but it felt right to me. I hope we can still be friends.""

, Have a polite, formal tone, and let it betray none of your inner feelings. Even though your opinion may be the right thought, it will not seem right to the other person. Don't sound like you know you're right, and act like the other person is definitely wrong, or you'll come off as snobby."
"
Identify your problem.,
Ask an honest, trustworthy friend/family/teacher about your personality or habits that make most people dislike you.,
Work hard to make these two values―courage and dreaming―your own.

,
Be aware of your appearances, especially if you are a girl.,
Be a hero.,
Believe in yourself.,
Get out there.,
Laugh at yourself.",How to Be Popular in High School Quickly," What is it that made you unpopular?


Some people became unpopular after they have moved to another city. This is hardly their fault though and it can only be fixed by time. Being unpopular is not always your fault, but you should examine what you are doing that causes you to turn other people off. There are always reasons why the most popular people are never friends with you.;
, But since these people are either so used to you by now or love the way you are, they don't think that there's anything wrong with you. Here are a few tips:


There are two universally respected values: courage and dream. Courage means that you're not afraid of speaking up. If someone is bothering you, confront them about it face-to-face. Courage also means you are willing to do your own thing, and not caving in to peer pressure. Courage does not mean bullying or starting fights with others. Only cowards do that. Courage is about taking chances and not being afraid of any setbacks or rejections. Accept all the bad things in life and never hide from them. Dreaming is all about having goals in life that are pretty much impossible to reach but that you work on every day, because you're determined to get them. Set your goals high and get started on them. Again, even if you get made fun of or if you have to do it alone, don't quit.

,, If you have only 5 outfits for the entire year, people will think you are poor or uncreative. Prove them wrong. If you don't have any money, work a part-time job. Get a cute hair cut. Get manicures. Make people know that you care about what you are putting out there. This isn't always crucial to popularity, but it helps a lot.


There is a thing called ""Popularity By Association."" If you are currently dating/hanging out with one of the populars, you will get a ""ticket"" to the lunch table.

, Yes, you get both fame and respect from your fellow students if you are a star athlete/performer. Earn your school recognition, and you will get yours. Be creative too―remember the Friend kid?

, Yes, you can do anything you set your mind on. The outcome isn't half as important as the process. Even if you can't be popular, know that you tried and that you are a winner for trying.

, Find a hobby and join others who are also interested in it. The more you invest in others, the more you will get back. Find clubs or teams and join them.

, It is hilarious to worry so much about other people's opinions of you, especially since you won't see most of them again for the rest of your life. The people who understand you will love you no matter how weird you are. Don't forget them once you get your new popular friends.


Never compromise yourself for the purpose of impressing others. You will just hate yourself later. Just as Mother Teresa said, ""If you get taken advantage of because you are nice, it is society's fault and not yours."" So be good/successful/happy/friendly even though some people will be jealous of you.

But it is a good thing to hang out with the most popular kids in your class the first couple days of school so you can get a head start at being popular. Try your hardest and sooner or later, you will get there.;
, Do you just want more friends? Are you jealous of what the popular kids do? Do you want to be invited to more parties? Do you want to date within the popular group? These are some fine reasons for desiring popularity.

, Popular kids generally hang out in cliques; make sure you'll be able to fit into one you like.

, If you like spending weekends at home playing video games, maybe re-evaluate; most of the day time on the weekends will be spent with your clique and the nights at parties with all the other cliques.

, A good way to set yourself apart in a group of wealthy, well-connected people is to offer them something that they either don't already have or is hard for them to obtain


Some examples would be: knowing someone at a good restaurant in town that is hard to get reservations at, having an in with a well recognized personal trainer, getting them into an event or product launch that features a popular celebrity.

, Once you are known by a lot of people, people start to talk about you, more often than not the words are not kind and flattering. It doesn't matter what people say about you as long as they're saying something!

, If your school has uniforms, you can still be unique.


Girls, this is easy. Try purses, jewelry, different hair styles, etc.
Guys, this might be a bit more difficult, but it is possible. If your dress code allows it, untuck your shirt and undo one or two buttons to avoid looking stiff.

, If you're one of the lucky ones who don't have that much of a dress code, stand out as much as you can. Brand names are worn way too much at private schools. You can still wear them, but try to look for more unique clothes at places like small boutiques in the downtown area, department stores, and if you're daring, secondhand stores. No one can tell the difference, unless they shop there too (in which case, they'll keep your secret).

, Hygiene is important in private schools; being smelly or dirty is unthinkable. Bathe, shave, and wash your face daily. Apply deodorant as needed. Brush your teeth two to three times a day with toothbrush and toothpaste. It's also suggested that you use mouthwash. Hair should be brushed neatly and often. Clean and trim your fingernails often. If your dress code allows it, paint your nails.


Use lotions, cleansers, moisturizers, scrubs, conditioners. Organic products are good as they don't damage your skin. Your bath products should make you smell good, and you can even put on light perfume. Makeup you can wear under your dress code will be limited, so a lip gloss and mascara are enough. If you must wear eyeshadow, go for a sheer or natural color. Remember, natural is best.

, It's a smart way to become more popular. Be very careful about turning in homework on time and in good shape. Remember to do it completely. Study for tests. Be prepared for a pop quiz at all times. If you need help, definitely ask a teacher for schoolwork advice or get a tutor.

, Popular people have lots of friends, and the best way to get them is to join a club or class. Some of the more popular extracurriculars are sports, chorus, dance, band, cheerleading (not every private school has cheerleading, though), etc.

, Find a design for your notebooks that you feel reflects your personality.

, Keep a notebook full of drawings or writings to show people. Be original and don't copy others.

, Invite them over a lot. Go shopping together. Don't gossip meanly. Be sweet to everyone. Having popular friends can be really helpful, but still, have a personality.

, Making new friends and solidifying those bonds takes time; you'll be spending a lot more time with your new friends so you won't have much left over for your old ones.

, One of the best ways for people to get to know who you are is to throw a big party and invite everyone. (Be careful though as it could easily backfire if things get out of control and the police show up.) Make sure that if you throw a party that you are well dressed, that your house is clean and well decorated, and that you let loose a little bit talk to people and get to know them, make bonds over similar interests and plant seeds for future hangout (add each other on social media or swap phone numbers).

, Once you become friends with the popular kids, you'll begin to be invited to things. Accept everything that you can. Hang out with them after school and grab some food; hang out with them on the weekends before they go out to party.


If you are offered libations of any sort from your clique, or even any of the other cliques, cordially accept but watch your intake, you don't want to make a fool of yourself.
Most cliques after a while will develop pre-party rituals, whether that's going to a certain place for food before hand, or meeting up and getting ready at certain person's house.
Most cliques will have a driving rotation, make sure that if it's your turn to drive you always do it and do it reliably (unless your clique is lucky enough to have a member with a driver).
Often you will stay at a certain person's house after nights of partying and this will always be pre-planned.

, This is where what you have to offer comes into play, if you have access to something cool and unique especially something they haven't experienced before, use it now. You can also start to host kickbacks at your house just inviting one or two cliques over to have a good time.

, You'll most likely be hanging out with your clique more than your own family at this point, some of the members of your clique might even become part of your actual family (ie. staying at your house on weeknights, eating dinner with your family, going on vacations with you). Start dating but avoid dating within your clique, you don't want to create unnecessary tension.


Be sure to keep your grades up and maintain your appearance.
You can still talk to your former friends but in reality there's a reason why you wanted to leave that group and you'll now have a new perspective about them.

If you want to get noticed, then you can't be known as the wallflower who hangs back at school dances or the girl who says nothing in class. You have to be known for your positive energy, your laughter, and your optimistic nature. You should be enjoying yourself, whether you're at the playground with your friends or learning about American history in class. You don't have to fake it, but you should work on being the kind of person who is able to find something to be happy about in almost any environment.


Okay, so you probably won't be cracking up in the middle of a science test. However, you should try to be as upbeat as you can, and to make other people want to be around you because of your positive energy. If you tend to be negative or whiny, people will be less inclined to hang out with you.
This doesn't mean that you should be fake or that you should pretend you're happy when you're really not. It does mean that you should work to think positively by pushing out those negative feelings, and to project your best self to the world. Everyone has bad days, and you don't have to force yourself to be chipper if you're feeling sad, but you should try to have more good days than bad.;
, You probably won't be made more popular if you're known as the girl who spilled soda all over herself — though hey, that happens. But if you're known for always having ridiculously cute shoes, having a unique laugh, making loom bracelets at recess, or being able to talk to almost anybody, then people will notice you more often. You don't have to dye your hair pink or wear fake tattoos to get noticed; whatever you do has to be more subtle and less attention-calling than that. It's up to you to decide what you want your trademark to be.


It can be that people always see you walking your cute dog on the weekends. Really, it can be anything positive that makes you stand out more.

, If you're known for having a talent or a skill, such as having a great signing voice, being the best kickball player in your grade, or being really good at Spanish, then more people will know who you are and will respect you for it. You don't have to show off or to try to be the best at every little thing. In fact, it's far better if you're really, really good at one thing so that it makes you stand out. Pick something you care about and try to master it; soon, people will notice you for it.


Also, being really good at something can help you build up your confidence, because you'll feel like you have more to offer. It's a win-win situation.
If you work on mastering something that is a group effort, such as playing soccer or being in the school play, then this will also be a great way for you to get to know more people and to become more popular that way.

, Another way to get noticed is to build up your self-confidence. Though it's not always easy to feel confident about yourself, especially when you're in the fifth grade and feel a little bit uncertain about everything, but you can make an effort to like and be proud of the person you are and the person you're becoming. You can do this by hanging out with people who make you feel good, trying to excel in school and getting help if you need it, and by talking to people about the things you love. If your friends are being bullied, stand up to the bully. If you have confidence, people will notice it — and you — from a mile away.


If you're feeling insecure, it's perfectly okay. Talk to a friend about it and think about ways that you can improve yourself, from getting better at talking to new people, to succeeding in school. Making an effort is the first step.

, You may not always feel confident, but looking confident can be half the battle. If you want people to notice you for being confident, then you have to make sure that your body reflects this. Your body language can do a lot of work for you, whether you're just walking down the halls or hanging out with friends. Plus, if your body language is more confident, it will trick you into feeling more confident, and that never hurt anybody. Here are some tricks to try if you want to have more confident body language:


Make eye contact when you talk to people
Stand tall instead of slouching
Have good posture, even when you're sitting
Don't cross your arms over your chest
Look straight ahead when you're walking, instead of down at the ground
Turn toward people when you talk to them, instead of away

, You don't have to look like a hair model to take good care of yourself. However, it's important to take care of your looks so that other people notice that you're treating yourself with respect. If you don't care at all how you look and leave the house looking sloppy, people will think you don't value yourself very much. This isn't about looking fake or like a celebrity — it's just about feeling like you're worth it enough to care for your looks. Here's what you should do:


Wash your hair every day or every other day, depending on your hair type
Brush your teeth every morning
Shower daily
Brush your hair before school

, You don't need to keep up with the latest trends or to wear what all the cool kids are wearing to be popular. In fact, if you try to do that and end up wearing something that isn't you, then it won't look right. You can shop at trendy stores like Hollister, American Eagle, Justice, Delia's, or Forever 21 if that's what you like, fashion-wise, but only if it feels genuine to you. The more important thing is that your clothes are clean, fit well, and make you feel good.


You can also get some matching accessories, such as necklaces or hats, to go with your look. But you don't have to overdo it.

, You may think that smiling just makes you look dopey or desperate, but this is far from the truth. Everyone loves a person who smiles at them, and smiling can make you feel better about yourself and it can make other people feel better about themselves as well. Make a habit of smiling at people when you pass them in the halls, at the bus stop, or even in class if you lock eyes. Smiling at people can help them put their guard down, and it will make you look more approachable so more people will want to talk to you.


You don't have to be maniacal about it. Don't seek out people to smile at, but do smile when you look at each other.
Smiling a lot will also give you a reputation for being friendly, and people will be more likely to come to you with questions or to ask you to play.

, If you slip and get your clothes dirty at school or do something that is embarrassing, just say ""oops"", and laugh about it and have fun with your friends instead of making a big deal about it. If you accidentally make an embarrassing comment in class or tell a joke that makes no sense, it will only seem like a big deal if you make it that way. If you're able to laugh, brush things off, and show that you don't take yourself too seriously, people will respect you more and will be more excited about hanging out with you.


Nobody wants to hang out with a person who is so serious that they are constantly afraid of offending them. If you can laugh at yourself, people will be much more excited to be in your orbit because they won't feel like they have to watch what they say.

, Don't just be nice to the ""cool"" kids and ignore the rest. Make a habit of being nice and friendly to everybody, unless that person gives you a reason not to be. Don't listen to what other people say and decide for yourself whether each person is really nice deep down instead of assuming that person is ""weird"" because of what someone says. You should appreciate every person for who he is, smile, ask how his or her day was, and know that you have something to learn from absolutely everybody. Having a reputation for being nice and friendly can only make you more popular.


The only time you shouldn't be friendly is if someone is treating you poorly. You don't want to be nice to the point where people are taking advantage of you.
Plus, think of it this way: you're only in fifth grade. Contrary to popular belief, the crowd of ""popular kids"" can change from elementary school to middle school to high school. If you're nice to everybody, then it's guaranteed that you're not alienating someone who will become popular later.

, Though it's impossible to never, ever complain, you should work on being a source of positivity instead of negative energy. You should talk about the things you love, compliment people, discuss fun things that are just around the corner, such as summer vacation or a movie you really wanted to see, or just make a habit of keeping things upbeat when you're talking to people. You don't want people to think of you as the person who is always negative or whining about nothing, or they'll be less likely to hang out with you.


If you're known for being positive, then people will be more likely to want to spend time with you and to approach you. If people think that all you'll do when they talk to you is complain, they may steer clear of you.

, Unfortunately, people can get fake in the fifth grade, if they are out to get something. They may smile at people they don't like, gossip too much, or just say things that they don't really believe in just to get attention. While this kind of behavior can boost your popularity in the short run, in the long run, you should try to avoid this kind of behavior and really work on being yourself. Let people know who you really are and don't be dishonest about your interests. If you're fake, people will be on to you pretty soon.


Though you may think that truly popular people backstab and gossip about each other all the time, truly popular people are so confident in themselves that they don't need to talk smack about people. Make sure that you don't fall into temptation and that you stay loyal to your friends. If people start gossiping around you, try to kindly change the subject or remove yourself from the conversation.

, If you really want to be social, then you can't just be social around the ten people you already know. That won't get you anywhere. Instead, you should be open to talking to completely new people, whether it's someone in another class or even another grade, or a new student in your class. If you're really comfortable with yourself, then you should have no problem talking to new people, introducing yourself, and seeing if you click. This is a key trait of truly popular people: they aren't afraid to put themselves out there a bit.


You don't have to be incredibly outgoing to be popular. Unfortunately, people who are shy get a bad reputation for being rude or standoffish. If you're too shy to strike up a conversation with a new person, you should still try to smile and be friendly when the person approaches you.
You shouldn't be closed off or think that you should avoid certain people because of their social status or reputation. Any person should be worth talking to as long as that person is nice and caring.

, If you really want to be popular, then you have to show people that you care about who they are, not about talking about yourself all the time. You can still open up to people while taking an interest in what they care about, what their lives are like, and what plans they have coming up. When you hang out with people, make sure they are doing at least half of the talking, and that you don't dominate the conversation. Ask them questions about their classes, their pets, their siblings, the sports they like to play, or anything else they like to talk about. You can show that you're genuinely interested in them, instead of just bragging about yourself.


Though opening up to people is an important way to be social, make sure that the person has a chance to open up, too.
You don't have to ask too many questions at once. You don't want the people to feel like they are being interrogated. Just ask enough questions to show that you really do care.

, There may not be as many ways to get involved at your school in the fifth grade as there will be in middle or high school, but you can still look for ways to get involved. You can join a foreign language club, pet lover's club, or even the student council. A lot of people like to run for school president or other student council positions to get known, and you can try that if it feels right for you. You can also help out your teachers after school, or find other ways to make your presence known in your school.


The more activities you get involved in, the more people will get to know who you are, and the more opportunities you'll have to meet people.

, Another way that you can get involved is to help out in your community. Though there may not be a ton of stuff you can do at your age, you can help your neighbors keep their lawns clean, walk dogs, help out at a local park or community, or help out a bake sale with your parents. If you go to church or another religious location, you may find a way to get involved in your community through that. If you help out in your community, you will have a stronger sense of self and will get to know more people.


Helping out in your community will also expose you to people of different ages and many different walks of life. This will help you gain popularity and feel proud of who you are.

, If you're interested in sports and want to try being part of a team, it can be fun to be involved in a sport like cheerleading, soccer, volleyball, baseball, tennis, or really any sport that your school or community offers. You don't have to be the world's greatest athlete to be involved in a sport, and being a part of a sport will help you learn to work with others, develop communication skills, and to find your niche when it comes to team work. Anyone can play sports. Though it's not mandatory, being involved in a sport can help you become more involved and be more popular, if it's the right fit for you.


Don't be self-conscious if you don't feel athletic enough to join a sport. Give it a try first and see if you've found the best fit. If you don't like soccer, for example, try baseball. And if you just don't find it clicking with any sport, try another activity, such as painting or playing guitar, that may be more exciting for you.

, If you really want to be a truly social creature, then you should be involved with a variety of people in your life. You shouldn't just be friends with the same type of person over and over; instead, be friends, or at least friendly, with people who are more sporty, people who are more into computers, or people who are more shy. The more different types of people you're friends with, the more comfortable you'll be in any social environment, and the more well-known and popular you'll be.


Be bold and get to know people in different grades. People in younger grades will look up to you, and people in sixth grade (whether they're in middle school or your school) can give you some tips on how to survive in the higher grades.
Don't just limit yourself to your school. Be friends with your neighbors, people on your rec teams, or people from other schools. This will help you branch out and be comfortable with a variety of people.

, If a friend needs help, you should help them. If you study a lot you can help your friends study for tests and help a friend do their homework. Offer to help people and be kind. Do not be mean. Remember, being popular isn't about being mean. Never boss anyone and always help others."

Try suggesting your input on plans for recess, or on what you are doing this weekend. Give advice to your friends if they need it. Care for others if you want them to care for you - people like caring friends.;
, Answer and ask questions, raise your hand, and volunteer to read aloud or be the example student.

, Remember, not everyone can like you. If they have mean comments, don't retort, that just starts fights and creates more hatred. Just walk away and talk to someone else. If they make rumors, tell an adult. Spreading rumors is a type of bullying that a teacher should stop.

, Girls, boys, and anyone else, can be friends. Gender has nothing to do with who you can be friends with. Try hanging out with them at recess or sitting by them at lunch. Make good conversation with them. Share a laugh. Don't ever be mean to each other.

, If people are making fun of them, stand up for them. Maybe you could sit by a person who couldn't find a spot at the lunch table and had to sit alone somewhere else. You can extend your friendship to everyone and anyone.

, Friends are key access to being cool and popular. Try meeting new people, but always remain friends to people you are really close to. Hang out with one or two friends every weekend, and spend time with all of your old friends, too. Never be rude or spread rumors about them or to them. Have fun hanging out and crack jokes. You could hang out in a huge group that always sticks together or just hang out with a few others. And being alone is great too! Whatever makes you happy.

, This way you can get Internet connection with your friends. If they're out of town or they moved away, just send them an e-mail and make contact with them. You can make plans over the Internet, or when you're bored, you can just start chatting.

, Program all your friend's phone numbers into it. Take pictures of you and your friends if it has a camera! Texting is a great way to communicate. However, this is only worthwhile if other people have phones, because otherwise there won't be anyone to text!

, You don't want to act too immaturely, because people won't take you seriously, but you also don't want people to think you're a bore or stuck up. Most people naturally do this, which means being yourself will let you follow this step!

, Listen to the teacher when they're explaining instructions or directions, or read all the directions on your worksheet. Follow them as well. Take time to do your work, and check it over. Make sure you get it done, and always finish your homework. Never, ever cheat.

, Once you get good, you can even teach your friends. Practice sports and instruments- just joining won't let you get good. Attend all the meetings for clubs. If your school doesn't have the after school sport you want to do, check to see if your city has a league!

, At sleepovers, you can play games, make videos, eat popcorn, watch movies, do crafts, or play Truth or Dare. At a party, set out snacks and make sure everything is planned out, so you don't run out of activities and get bored in the middle of it.

, Be a representative, or run for an elected position. See if people elect you and see if you win. If you don't, don't be disappointed. Keep your head up high and have confidence in yourself. Be sure to make suggestions, and do everything you've been assigned. Listen to what your classmates want- after all, you're there to represent them!

, If you misspeak, mess up in sports, or do something else, just laugh and shrug it off! It's likely no one will remember it next week, anyway, and it's important to not take yourself too seriously.

, Always be kind and helpful. Try being funny and cracking jokes, if that's you. Be the smartest you can be (but don't make fun of people if they aren't as smart). Be creative and spontaneous. Be active. Just figure out who you are!

, Hygiene is very important, because nobody likes a bad-smelling person. Be sure to:


Wash yourself under the arms and on your feet in the shower, because those are the most smelly places.
Rub on some deodorant in the mornings (if you're old enough to need it).
Put on some good smelling lotion, or use something else that gives you a nice smell. (Remember- some people are allergic to fragrances. If that's you (or one of your friends) don't do this step. Being itchy and uncomfortable, or sneezing all the time, is not good for anyone.
Wash your face every morning and night.
Keep your nails neatly cut and clean.
Brush your teeth twice a day, and you should floss as well.

, Be sure to wash your hair frequently so it doesn't look greasy. Brush your hair out in the morning, and style it. If you have long hair, you can put it in a ponytail, braid, or bun, wear a cute headband, or, for special occasions, curl or straighten it. You could also braid it after a shower at night, sleep, then take it out for beautiful waves. Short hair has fewer styling options, so do whatever you want with it!

, Anything that fits you well, is comfortable, and is stylish. Find your own style, like country, sporty, or girly. Just try your own style, and be unique. If you like something, then buy it. Don't be afraid what other people say. Confidence is a great quality.

Put yourself out there.",How to Be Popular in High School," There's nothing worse than being fake, because then your ""friends"" won't like you for you. Have the confidence to know that you're an amazing person who has a lot to offer, and you'll be more likely to attract a diverse group of interesting people. Don't tell people what you think they want to hear just to make them like you and avoid bragging just to make yourself sound cool. People will be able to tell if you're just trying to impress them or suck up to them, and you'll be less likely to make friends with them. Instead, slowly open up and let people know about who you are and the things that really matter to you. Also if you are fake chances are that people will notice and they will talk making this even harder for you.


If you only become popular by trying to be someone you're not, then where's the fun in it? You don't want to keep up a charade forever, do you?
Remember that if you have to completely change who you are to get people to like you, then it probably isn't worth it.;
, Nobody likes a stuck up person. Smile to the people you know in the hallways. Don't act like you're better than them; arrogance is a huge turn off. If someone mentions you, you want them to talk about your good side, not your bad side. However, don't overdo it or they'll just start using you. You may think that you have to act like one of the Mean Girls to be popular, but in reality, this won't get you very far.


To be truly nice, you should be polite and have good manners. This means holding doors for people, saying hello to people you know, making room for people walking in the halls, and being friendly even if you're in a bad mood.
This doesn't mean you have to put on that false cheery persona you can sometimes see from adults; it just means that you should be kind to people, regardless of how popular you think they are.
There's nothing worse than a person who is only nice to popular people or people who he thinks can get him somewhere. If you're mean to the people ""below"" you and nice to the people ""above"" you, then people will be on to you pretty soon.

, If you want to make genuine friends, then you can't let people walk all over you. If you stick to your guns and know when to defend yourself, you'll actually gain respect and will be more likely to make more friends and to gain popularity. If you're nice to people just because you want them to like you, you won't get very far and you won't be respected.


If someone is being mean to you, making you feel bad about yourself, and just generally putting you down for no reason, you shouldn't have to take it. Let the person know that his or her actions are unacceptable.
You don't have to stoop down to a person's level just because the person is being mean to you. You can tell someone to stop what he or she is doing without calling names or being mean in return. Remember that you're better than that.

, If you're friendly and are always going up to new people and making small talk with them, you'll be on your way to easily making friends. You should be excited to get to know new people, no matter what crowd they're in or what grade they're in. Of course, you should take it slow and not bombard new people, or people who look busy, but if you find an opportunity to talk to someone new, like if you're at your locker by yourself with another person at his locker standing next to you, then you should take it.


When you're talking to new people, you should take things easy, talking about your classes, your hobbies, or what music you like. Ask the person a few easy questions to show that you care. You can talk about the serious stuff later, when you get to know each other better.

, The key to being truly social and popular is not to talk about yourself all the time or to brag, but to show a real interest in other people. As the saying goes, you should be interested, not interesting. People will like you a lot more if you ask them questions and show that you care about them than if you try to show off. The next time you talk to someone, smile, ask questions about the person's day, make eye contact, and show that you really do care. This doesn't mean you should fake it, but that you should make an effort to make people feel like they are cared for. Here are some things you can do:


Ask the person about how his weekend went
Ask about the person's extra-curricular activities
Compliment something the person is wearing
Ask about something the person mentioned last time
Find a balance between talking about yourself and the other person

, Sure, high school is a time when many people act like they are literally too cool for school. They may wear too much eyeliner, hunch over in class, show up late, or shrug when their teachers reprimand them. However, this should not be the way you approach high school. Embrace the fact that it's okay to care, and that you should try to go after the things that matter to you instead of worrying that you'll come off like a dork. If you really like English class, get excited about talking about your favorite book; if you love being on the tennis team, tell your friends about your upcoming match.


Talking about the things that make you happy will make you a more exciting, engaging person. Give your opinions too. Agreeing with the opposite person and simply nodding to whatever they say will make you look very boring. Try to be a conversation starter and know when to listen and when to answer back to people.

, Small talk is a skill that many high school students lack, and if you know how to make small talk, you'll up your social game and will be on your way to being more popular. To make small talk, you just have to be able to chat with people about anything at all when you see them in the halls, without getting nervous or running out of things to say. Just relax, stop worrying about saying the wrong thing, and make the other person comfortable as you engage in a quick conversation in the halls or before class starts. Here are some things you can do when you make small talk:


Talk about the class you just came from or were going to.
Ask the person about his or her weekend.
Talk about anything coming up in school, such as the fall dance or football game, and ask if the person is going.
Chat about something in your environment, such as a flyer for the pep rally, or a shirt the person is wearing with the name of your favorite college on it.

, You may think that the last thing you want to do in high school is to every smile at anyone, because smiling is just so uncool, but you should change your attitude if you want to be more social and get on your way to being more popular. Smiling will make you more approachable, will make more people notice you, and will make more people likely to feel welcome in your presence. It's a big part of being friendly. You don't have to smile at absolutely everyone in your school, but if you walk by someone in the halls, take a chance and give that person a little smile, even if you don't know him or her.


Let's face it. People in high school tend to be judgmental, and are likely to think that someone is mean or rude for no reason. If you smile more, people will be much more likely to think you're a welcoming, open person.

, You don't need the most trendy or expensive clothes to be popular, but you do need to look like you've put some time into your outer appearance. This isn't meant to sound superficial; it's just a fact that people who dress better are taken more seriously and are treated with more respect than people who maintain a sloppy appearance, whether they are at a job interview or meeting people at a party. Wear clothes that fit you, that are free of wrinkles, and that are clean, and people will be more likely to notice you.


Your clothes can be a little loose or a little tight, depending on the look you're going for. But if your pants are obviously the wrong size, you may ask yourself if the statement is worth making.
Just a few nice accessories, such as a pair of silver earrings or a nice watch, can help tie your outfit together.
Don't worry about having five or ten completely new outfits. It's better to own fewer nice items of a higher quality. One really nice pair of jeans can serve you better than three cheap pairs of jeans.

, Take a shower, shave, brush your teeth, put on deodorant, and keep your body and hair nice and clean. Though smelling fresh and clean is important, you should make sure not to load up on too much perfume or cologne or it'll be just as bad as if you don't bathe at all. Taking the time to have good hygiene shows that you respect and care for yourself.


You should come to school fresh and showered. Bring deodorant to gym class and make sure that you're always as clean as you can be.

, Don't drink, smoke, run away, or sneak out. Bad choices can damage your life before it starts, and this will not make you popular. You may think that you will get noticed if you act rebellious or break some rules, and you really will get noticed, but not for long, and not for the reasons you want people to recognize you for. There's a difference between being popular for being well-rounded and friendly and developing a bad reputation.


It's easier to make good decisions when you surround yourself with people who have good heads on their shoulders. If you fall prey to bad influences, you'll be more likely to make bad decisions yourself.
If you're at a party, avoid drinking, jumping off high surfaces, or doing anything else that is ill-advised just to show off. The attention you get for these antics won't last.

, If you're happy with who you are, what you do, and what you look like, people will be able to tell from a mile away. Smile at people and don't be afraid to say hi to them or to strike up a conversation. Walk with your head high and have positive body language, good posture, and a friendly energy whenever people notice you. This will make people want to get to know you and will make them interested in who you are.


Developing true confidence can take years. You can aim to get yourself there if you work on doing the things you really love and excelling at something, so you feel happier and prouder of yourself throughout your day.
You should also make a list of all of the things you love about yourself. Consult it often, especially if you're feeling down.
You can also work to change the things you want to change about yourself. Don't think that you have to be the way you are; you have control over your destiny.
Another way to up your confidence is to spend time with people who make you feel good about yourself. Ditch the friends who are always putting you down.

, Even though you might think that it will help boost your popularity, people will think badly of you. Do not do it, since it is not fair to become popular at another person's expense! Plus, bullies may be feared, but they are rarely popular. You don't want to develop a reputation for being a jerk.


People who are truly popular don't bother putting people down, because they're confident enough in who they are and don't see the need to be mean.

, Remember to focus on your studies even if you're trying to become more popular. Your grades are way more important than your social status. If you do well in school, you will be noticed for being a good student, and will have more opportunities to meet more people. Sure, you don't want to look like a nerd, but if you're proud of how hard you work, other people will appreciate you.


Remember that, in the scheme of things, while being popular in high school may be fun for a while, when you look back on your high school years, you will regret not studying as hard as you could have much more than not trying harder to be popular.

, Whether you're hitting the gym or excelling in a school sport, exercising will not only make you look good, but it will make you feel good about yourself. And if you feel good about who you are, then more people will notice you as an awesome, confident person who is worth getting to know. Though exercise alone won't help you win any friends, it can contribute to a lifestyle that will lead you to be more popular.


Making a fitness a priority will also lead you to meet more people and to have more friends, whether you're on a school team, in a rec league, or just taking classes at your local gym.

, Another way to get noticed is to let people see that you're able to have a good time no matter where you are. Whether you're walking in the halls, at a party, or getting lunch in the cafeteria line, you should look like you're enjoying yourself. You don't have to laugh wildly in math class, but you should work on giving off a positive vibe and letting people see that you're happy with who you are and what you're doing. If you're talking to your friends, really engage in the conversation instead of looking around to see if there are more popular people to talk to. If you're having too much of a great time to care what people think, then they'll be more likely to want to talk to you.


If you're always laughing, feeling good, and happy with what you're doing, you're more likely to attract friends.
Of course, this doesn't mean you should fake it if you're having a genuinely crummy day, but that it doesn't hurt to really enjoy yourself if you have the opportunity.
It's okay to complain if you really want to, but you don't want to get a reputation for being a negative person.

, Though being social, being involved, and being friendly are sure-fire ways to become more popular, you should also be comfortable with being independent and doing what you want to do. If you want to wear something no one in your school has ever worn before, listen to completely different music from your friends, or try an activity your school doesn't offer, such as yoga or archery, then you shouldn't be reluctant about it just because no one else is doing it. Being independent will help you get noticed for a simple reason — because you'll stand out.


This doesn't mean that you should be different just for the sake of being different, but because you truly want to do something different. You don't want to look like a poser if you're trying something ""alternative"" just to get attention.

, Though there are many things you can do to up your social game and to stand out more to your peers, you should be careful about looking like you're trying too hard. In high school, people are particularly sensitive about this, so you should avoid making it seem like you are willing to do anything to be popular. This means that you shouldn't try too hard to talk to the popular kids if they aren't interested and that you shouldn't butt into conversations where you aren't welcome. You should also avoid trying to copy the looks of more popular people, because they will be on to your tricks.


Trying to make new friends is a great way to put yourself out there and to be more popular. However, you should be on the lookout and know when people aren't looking to make friends. You don't want to risk embarrassing yourself by coming on too strong.
The same goes for attracting people of the opposite sex. While snagging your crush will make you feel great, you should take things slow and get a sense of the other person's feelings before you move forward.

, Whether you're into basketball, cheerleading, French club, or band, joining a few extra-curricular activities can help you become more popular simply because you'll get to know a wider variety of people. If you only get to know the people in your classes, you'll be missing out on a wide variety of amazing people from your school. You'll also find it easier to connect with people who share your interests, so you'll be more likely to make friends.


Remember that, to be popular, people have to actually know who you are — what better way is there to get your name out there than to get involved in extra-curricular activities?
Finding the right extra-curricular activity for you can also help you find a new passion, explore new hobbies, and maybe even to get inspired to follow a new career path.

, Though it's important to be a good student, you should still be able to find time to relax and make a few friends in your classes. Whether you're chatting it up with your lab partner or the person who sits behind you in Algebra II, you should make an effort to get to know the people in your classes —without disrupting your learning, of course!


You may end up finding a new best friend after working on a school project or putting together a lab report with a new classmate. Don't think that you can only find friends after school hours.
People in your classes may also be excited to meet new people, because people don't always end up in class with people they already know since class assignments are random.

, Another way to be involved is to do something in your community. Whether you're volunteering at a soup kitchen or playing softball in a rec league, doing something that is community-based will help you get to know more people and to become experienced with talking to a wider variety of people. You may also meet some people from school who are doing the same thing, and this will help you make more friends from school or your neighborhood.


Not only will getting involved in your community make you meet more people, but volunteering and doing something useful will build your confidence, which will make it easier for you to meet new people. It's a win-win situation.

, If you want to be popular, then you have to work on doing many different things with yourself; if you only play baseball or only work for the school paper, then you will miss out on getting to know so many interesting people. Though you shouldn't spread yourself too thin, you should engage in at least two or three activities that are likely to expose you to new people; if you stick to one interest only, then you'll just be friends with the same five people. Work on finding multiple things that interest you, so that you can make friends with a variety of interesting people.


Part of being popular just means that people know who you are when you walk down the halls. Involving yourself in a diverse range of activities can help you get this done.

, If you aren't afraid to take risks and to put yourself out there during and after school, you'll be more likely to get yourself known. Sign up for your school's talent show. When a visiting guest speaker comes to school, volunteer to come up on stage. Help a student out with his homework after school. Spend your study hall volunteering at the school library. If you're only focused on doing the thing you have to do instead of finding new things to do, then you'll be less likely to be popular.


If you're really shy, then you don't have to put yourself out there in a big, showy way. You can find small ways to make a difference, such as tabling for a club or making an announcement for your sports team in your homeroom.

Wash your hair and face every other day, using shampoo and conditioner for your hair and spot scrub and moisturizer for your face.;
, If you wear a uniform, roll up your sleeves or something to make yourself stand out. If you're allowed to wear your own clothes to school, dress in what you feel.

, If you chat with the popular girls, be confident. Go up to them with a cute smile on your face and say ""Hi! I've never really got to know you guys, but I have heard that you're all really nice!"". Make sure to compliment them and, with a chance, they might invite you to eat with them at lunch.

, If a boy is not one of the popular girl's boyfriend, you're all set. Try to look nice and walk over to where the boys might be. Chances are they will be on the football pitch or basketball court.

, If you are nice to everyone, good things will be heard about you. Try to make a good first impression and when around the school, give everyone a cute smile and a ""Hey!"".

Countdown days until summer.,Enjoy your summer vacation.",How to Wait for a Summer Vacation," Find something that you can really get into. On the weekends you might want to do something active, like rock climbing, or taking dancing lessons. If sports aren't your thing, try something else- whatever you enjoy doing. It's important to find something that you enjoy doing because time passes by really quickly.;
, If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend or really close friend, it may make you less likely to want to leave. This will be a tough situation to deal with. On the other hand, a close relationship can distract your attention.

, Learn about its good things and what it has to offer, because when you leave, you'll appreciate your vacation a lot more, and you might learn a very valuable lesson from this.

, Hand in good quality assignments and homework and focus on your exams. If you focus hard on homework and tests, summer will come faster. Also, your parents will not be mad if you get A's all year.

, Find things that your vacation location has to offer that your home also does. For example, if you're going to Italy, and you want to have real pizza, don't go to that Pizza Hut, but go to a classic restaurant in your city. But don't do this excessively. If you do, you won't appreciate your vacation spot as much.

, This shows you that time is really passing by, fast. However, for some people, counting the days until summer arrives only makes time seem to slow down. Try forgetting about the future and get involved in the current activities. Before you know it, summer's here!

Don't use your new friends (and just let them use you a little).,
Don't hide your being homeschooled.,
Show them that you're proud to be homeschooled.,
Find any sport and social associations in your area:



Join a boys' or girls' organization: Scouts Association, Campfire Girls, 4-H, FFA or a similar club organization or at church.,

Play online games like smallworlds.com; that is a site where you can talk to people and make friends.,
Get a hobby; do a study or a project.,
Study music, local acting school/club, take voice training and learn your favorite instrument(s):



Look in kids theater.",How to Be Popular in Homeschooling," If you're homeschooled, you are probably at your house more than most kids are. If you don't get out, you might not meet many other kids, and then there is no way to become popular. So, try to have fun with the people that you like. Don't feel weird about wanting to have some fun. If you feel too uncomfortable with the ""new friend"", then maybe people you have met are not the people that fit as your friends.



Speak up: talk to people wherever you can; such as in order to meet people in line at the post office or at the bank.

Get active: jogging, hiking, skating, swimming, rock climbing, biking, bowling, play throw/pass and catch, shoot baskets; do miniature golfing or putting.

Participate in youth activities at your church or temple.

Eat out to see the kind of people there. Be careful at the food court of a mall or at a burger, pizza or taco restaurant; any can be there: dopers, nuts, liars or crooks.;
, If you can meet some popular kids at a public school near you, you can try to become friends with them. Once you are friends with one popular person, ask when you can hang out, and maybe he/she'll bring a friend, too. Then, you will be friends with two people. Chances are that at least one of them could mention your name to fellow popular people. Soon, others will know of you and could be dying to meet you as a friend!



Smile; laugh. Especially learn to laugh at yourself, rather than being embarrassed or shy; be outgoing; you should have fun talking -- then they will. Try listening actively; look at the face of whoever has the floor.

Respond to their ideas by being fun, kind and positive ~~ and don't stare at people ~~ or ogle their physiques. Take a joke. Don't get angry over small stuff or self-centered, or worried over who eats the most snacks or chips 'n stuff.

Help set the pace: ask about ordinary stuff, and if they are talkative, listen more -- or if not talkers -- then don't push to talk, say ""Yeah,"" agree, nod and smile (Relax; don't be a know it all, or overly insistent).

Find common interests to talk about or to do: music, movies, TV shows, a book, styles, current events if of interest, ""heroes"", sports, etc.

, If you already have a friend at a public school, go with them and meet their friends. This is a great opportunity to meet more people and have a fun time!


If you haven't met anyone at a school event, you can approach someone in the line for snacks and food, or just talk to a person who is sitting at a table next to yours. This will tell your new friend that you are fun, outgoing, and it might make them want to introduce you to their friends.

, You may run into someone your age, and if you look presentable, you'll seem likeable and cool/warm.


If you do wind up going out looking bad, you may see someone. There is a good chance you will see that person again and he/she might remember the encounter.

, You just got new friends; so, don't offend them by taking away their friend by hanging out with another one of their friends. That will make them mad, and then they will trash talk you. Instead suggest that you can all hang out together, and that way, no feelings will be hurt.

, If your friends ask about what school you go to, tell them the truth. If they ask you further questions about it, answer every question showing them that you aren't that different from them.


For example, your friend: ""So, do you get annoyed with your parents when they try to teach you something?""

You: Yeah, sometimes. It's about like a teacher and student relationship during the teaching time. But when we are done with teaching, we're all good.




, This will make you even more popular, if you tell them that it's fun and that you enjoy it. They'll think your easygoing and will want to talk to you.

,

Take lessons in a skill or sport. Think about tennis, golf, swimming, etc. Check at community recreation (rec) center and at the YMCA/YWCA (the Y), and Boys and Girls Club, or other.

Join a sport league -- and get on a team. Study karate/judo, etc. Join local little-league baseball, youth football or soccer, etc.

,



Find an ""expert parent"" such as your parent or of another homeschooler who may be good at or well versed in history, writing, math or science. Try to get a group together for tutoring or doing a project in that certain topic.

, Read or study there, but get around. Speak to and meet people.

Join a book club by mail or locally, and discuss the subjects with other kids.

Play board games, scrabble, chess and trivial pursuits, etc.

, An old or young man may say he is a ""kid"" in elementary school and might be a man such as a pedophile (to trick others, trying to meet and take advantage of kids for sexual reasons) -- might be mentally ill. Be careful.

, Learn and have fun showing your collectibles.



Get a part-time job. -- or start a ""small business"".

Walk, run, or take a bike ride.,
Set up a frisbee golf in your backyard.,
Play games.,
Camp in your backyard.,
Exercise indoors to beat the heat.",How to Spend Your Summer Vacation at Home1," Summer is the perfect time to head outside. You can enjoy the great outdoors (and get in some cardio) while walking through your neighborhood or running around the block. If you have a bike and a helmet, consider taking a daily bike ride instead.


Look online for a kid-friendly “30-Day” walking or running challenge. This will give you something to work towards every day!;
, Can’t make it to the putting green this summer? Play frisbee golf instead! Set up a course around your house or neighborhood and assign a par to each hole. You and your friends will spend hours competing for the best score.


In your spare time, design a course map and score cards.

, Before tvs, computers, and tablets, kids spent their summer days playing games, like tag, outdoors. The next time you get together with friends, consider playing:


Red rover
Sharks and minnows
Wiffle ball
Four-square
Kick ball
Capture the flag
Hide and seek, Who needs a campground when you have a backyard? Spend the night or weekend at your backyard campsite. After you’ve pitched the tent, sit around the fire (or grill) toasting marshmallows and stargazing.

Internet.,
Improve your social status.,
Get moving!,
Study.,
Read!,
Have some me-time!,
Get lots of sleep.",How to Spend Your Free Time (Girls)," As you know, the Internet is the most available tool to relieve your boredom! It contains so many interesting sites and cool stuff, which can leave you breathless! All you have to do is explore them. Start with Google, the most popular website on earth, because you can find everybody and everything from there:



Computer Games (like miniclip.com).

Social networks like Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and others.

Chats where you can talk to people all over the world.

Wikipedia where you can get new knowledge.

wikiHow where you can read, edit and write new how-to articles.
Websites where you can learn to speak new languages.
Virtual cities.
Designing programs.

Google Earth which allows you to travel and explore every centimeter on earth.

YouTube - Share videos and music, etc.;

, Vacation, or free time, is a great time to start working out. Try doing it with a close friend, you'll have so much fun, I promise.

You can buy a Cardio/Aerobics etc. DVD and working out with a friend, sister, parent or any other person you like (sports in pairs = better results and having a good time together). Also, you can load your iPod or another music player and go jogging somewhere. Try it out, you might have fun. Good Luck!

, Yes, you shouldn't spend all your free time studying - the main thing is to relax and get a break from school. But the fact is, you shouldn't delay your studying time, because then you'll wake up one day and go: and then you'll get stressed out, which is bad, and things just won't go well. So, take it seriously: you need it. If you study for a little bit of your free time regularly, it will be a lot more effective and less time-consuming than having studying take up all of your free time just before a test because you're not ready. If studying school material makes you nervous because you're not good at it, have a look at How to Learn Effectively, or think about getting a tutor.

, Reading isn't just for geeks, because it's actually sort of fun. Eventually, everybody finds the type of books he or she likes (horror, romance, thriller, etc.) and enjoys. You can go to the nearest library or bookstore and check out their collection.

, If you have spare time, you could use it and turn it into ""me-time"". Take an hour or two for your body and soul: have a beauty bath, relax, breathe, take care of your skin and your body, listen to slow music and have a home spa.

, Weekends and holidays are ideal times to catch up on your sleep.

Release.",How to Gain the Motivation to Do Well in School," This is the most commonly known but also one of the hardest, if not the cheesiest, step when you set out to solve a problem. Yes, today you have decided you want to do something about your habits, but what about tomorrow? How about next week? What about when you log on to the internet while your homework lays on the table? Will you be motivated to change then? Of course not. You have been there. You got tired, then distracted, and soon were on the internet. You felt guilty, but swallowed your guilt saying ""I'll commit tomorrow."" NO! Do not do this. If need be, write down everything you are committed to do and post reminders everywhere. Post-it notes can do wonders. By constantly seeing the phrase ""I need to change"", your brain is, primed for change. Please, please, please commit to this. Post it as your status on all your social networks. Truly become committed to change. And do not feel embarrassed by your postings, feel empowered. Post your intentions on the background of your computer and as your screen saver. If you don't have your own user account on your family computer, explain to your family members, the extent of your commitment and your need to post reminders to motivate yourself. If they are like most families, they will understand, and will stand beside with support you had never imagined. You will definitely gain a load of respect from them.;
, This is very important. You must write down a many different things. You should write down these things in this order and on different pages in your notebook. What classes and activities you are in: This is to sort out your life a bit. If you want, you can also write down the days and times that you have these classes and activities. What things you are behind in and/or are missing: This gives you a sense of what you're up against. As the list gets smaller and smaller, you'll find yourself more motivated to get it completely cleared up. What your mark is in each class: This way you know what things you are great at, and what things you might need to study extra hard on. It's sometimes depressing seeing your marks, but you must write these things down. All things that do not benefit you (nose picking, alcohol, drugs, computer, etc.): Commit to gradually reduce the number of times you participate in these activities. A healthier life style and better you focuses the mind, can lead to great, inspiring things, and is over all better for you. If you're having trouble with these, please see other articles on wikiHow. All the things you want to accomplish: These are your goals. Without goals set out, you might improve and stop after you've improved a little bit. This is not good. You should ALWAYS try to improve, no matter how good you get or how tired you are. After you have completed a goal, write out a greater goal. Think of it like this: You set out to run a mile, and complete that goal. If you keep improving on it, you could be in the Olympics! Finally, the great things about yourself: After a bit of depression writing out all that other stuff, you need to focus on the positive. Otherwise this mountain you are trying to climb with seem insurmountable. Feeling good about who you are is a great motivation. It could be as simple as ""I have nice fingers"", as great as ""I am the strongest person in my family"", or as average (to you) as ""I have the skills to cook food for my family every night"". Never put yourself down in here. Focus on the positive. Don't think ""I have amazing lips... but my skin has lots of acne."" It isn't the point of this.

, This is very hard, especially if you are like I am, where you love chocolate, are picky about vegetables, and aren't very athletic. However, it is possible. Perhaps you have a wii, and have a bit of anger issues. You could always take out your anger by practicing every day at boxing on Wii Sports. Or maybe you live on a farm and own a bike. You can always go for a bike ride. If you're picky about foods, try to eat something each day that you do like. Perhaps you like bananas. Try eating one every day. You don't have to eat a salad and run a marathon to exercise and eat healthy. Perhaps you'll grow addicted to it all. :]

, It's most likely you have someone weighing you down. Whether it be your friends, parents, siblings, or enemies. They say you can't do it. They say you'll fail at life. Prove them wrong. Anger is a common emotion you feel when you think of when they say this. Take that anger and channel it. Focus it so that instead of a comeback, you can prove them wrong. Make them feel foolish. This is a very evil step, it seems, but this is what got ME motivated.

, This is the fun part. Find a few friends in your grade, four will do, to study with on the weekends. You could make a group out of it, or you can study with one friend each weekend of the month. Two brains ARE better than one, and if you can refrain from talking the ENTIRE time, you can both be beneficial to each other. You can even make a sleepover of it. That way, after your hard work, you have the night to chat away as a treat. If you're like me, you may be home schooled and do not have classmates to interact with. No problem! Your area will most likely have a homeschool group. You can join some activities with the group, make friends, and gain study buddies! Even older friends will do. They most likely see the stuff as easy by the time they're in a new, more difficult grade, and they'd probably be willing to help you.

, Have you ever thought of the perfect student? The one person you imagine in your head who goes to Harvard, got straight A's in school, they're popular and nice, go to the gym every day, and they just so happen to have perfect hair? Well, no one can be perfect, but ""play"" this as a game. On your adventure to motivating yourself, you could see it as ""leveling up"". Every time you get better, you gain a level, trying to achieve the final level, ""Ruler of the school"". Aim to be that perfect person. I realize you cannot be perfect, but you can get pretty close if you aim for Pluto (the distant not-a-planet).

, Life is not all work, although it seems like it when you're trying to do better. Every time you achieve a goal, improve your grade drastically, go two weeks sober of a bad activity, or hand in at least half of your missing assignments in a class, give yourself a good day off. Do something you love to do. You deserve it. Just try not to do it too often. You don't want to go into the habit of days off, or get used to pampering yourself. This is a reward for doing something big and challenging.

, Let go of any bad, embarrassing moments, mistakes, or worries. Let go of things you've done or situations you've been in. Let go of it all. That was the old you. Think of it as you were possessed. You were possessed by stress. Don't think about it, be embarrassed by it, or regret it. You've obviously learned from it, and you're changing. Let go of it all. You are no longer the you you originally knew. You are new in the eyes of everyone.

Check your suspension notice.,

Receive the hearing officer's decision.",How to Defend Yourself in a School Suspension Hearing," If you are going to be suspended, the school must first send home a written notice that specifically describes the misconduct for which you are being suspended and details your procedural rights regarding the suspension.The notice must include the date of the incident and a description of your actions that caused the school to recommend your suspension. This description must be detailed enough that you know what they're talking about.
You typically aren't entitled to a formal hearing for a short-term suspension, but you do have the right to request an informal hearing or conference with the principal and explain your actions or present evidence in your defense.
The suspension notice either will include a date for an informal hearing or tell you what you need to do to request one.;
, The written notice typically will be addressed to your parents or guardians anyway, and they probably will want to know what happened and what you did to get in trouble.This is a situation in which you need to be up front and honest with your parent or guardian. If you are guilty of the infraction with which the school has charged you, don't tell your parent or guardian otherwise.
The more open and honest you are, the easier it will be for your parent or guardian to help you. Keep in mind that they don't want you to get suspended any more than you do. It's easier to pursue alternatives to suspension if everyone has all the facts and is working with the same information.
If there are legitimate reasons that your involvement in the incident was over-stated – say, because you happened to be caught in the wrong place at the wrong time – let your parent or guardian know.

, You have the right to a hearing regarding your suspension, but not all school districts schedule them automatically. If your school only holds hearings on request, you must fill out a form or write a letter and submit it by the deadline on your suspension notice.Your school may require the request to come from your parent or guardian instead of you directly. Make sure the form is filled out and signed by the correct person.
If your parent or guardian refuses to sign the form or write a letter, speak to your school's guidance counselor and find out what other options are available.

, If you submitted a written request for a hearing, you typically will receive a written notice providing the date, time, and location of your hearing and how to reschedule if necessary.The notice may include additional information about the hearing procedure so you have a better idea of what to expect.
If there are statements of your rights, read them carefully. They tell you what you can do to defend yourself in the school suspension hearing, including the types of evidence allowed, whether you can bring witnesses, and whether you can have an attorney.

, Schools publish an updated version of the code of conduct each year, typically making it available on the school website. You'll need to read the rules you're charged with violating as well as the sections covering suspension procedure.Make sure the offense with which you've been charged is one listed in the school's handbook as punishable by suspension. If not, you can essentially argue that the punishment doesn't fit the crime.
You also need to find out if your infraction results in mandatory suspension, or if there are alternatives. Typically schools will attempt alternative means of discipline and reserve suspension as a last resort.
If alternatives are available and haven't been explored, you can bring them up at your hearing.
The school handbook also typically has a section describing the procedures used when a student is suspended. Read these so you know what to expect.

, You have the right to review your permanent record, and it may contain information relevant to your suspension – particularly if you are being suspended as a result of cumulative disciplinary infractions.Check your record against the school's handbook to determine if suspension is appropriate. For example, if your school has a ""three strikes"" type of rule that mandates suspension after three incidents resulting in in-school suspension in one semester, you may be off the hook in terms of the suspension if you can show you were sent to in-school suspension twice last year, but only once this semester.
You also should look for positive marks or notes on your record. You can use these in your defense to demonstrate that the behavior was out of character for you.

, If anyone saw the incident that led to your suspension, they may be willing to make a statement in your defense. You also might be able to get teachers or coaches to write character reference letters.Teachers and coaches who are willing to speak up in your defense can be excellent witnesses – both as character references and as eyewitnesses to the incident itself, if they were there.
Be cautious about taking statements from fellow students, particularly if they also were implicated in the incident or are facing disciplinary action for an identical or similar infraction.
If the principal thinks you and the other student made a deal with each other to provide supportive witness testimony for each other, the student's statements could end up doing you more harm than good.
For informal suspension hearings, you may not be able to bring witnesses with you. However, you typically can have them give you written statements to present to the principal or hearing officer.

, Often you can't have an attorney represent you at a suspension hearing, particularly if you're only being suspended for a few days. However, an attorney may provide helpful information to you regarding your rights.Particularly if you have special needs that may have affected your behavior, you have rights in a disciplinary situation that differ from other students. An attorney can explain these to you.
Since you typically won't be able to consult with or hire an attorney on your own, talk to your parent or guardian if you think an attorney could benefit your defense.
Your parent or guardian may be worried about attorney's fees. However, many attorneys provide a free initial consultation, and you can use this to your advantage.

, Before the date of your hearing, take some time to put any documents, statements, or affidavits in order and make an outline of what you plan to say in your defense at the hearing.Your appearance and demeanor can play a large part in the outcome of your hearing. For this reason alone, it's important to be prepared.
As in a criminal trial, you have the right to remain silent at your hearing. However, when you do defend yourself, nothing you say can be used in any other proceeding – not a school disciplinary hearing on another matter, nor in any juvenile court proceeding.
Make detailed notes of what you want to say, and practice speaking in front of a mirror or using your family members as an audience. Keep practicing until you feel comfortable and confident about the statement you've prepared.
Keep any documents or evidence you plan to show the principal or hearing officer neat and in good condition. It's a small thing, but if someone gives you a written statement and you keep the paper unwrinkled and clean, it shows that you're capable of exercising respect and good care.

, You cannot defend yourself if you don't show up. Plan on arriving early and dress appropriately for the occasion in clean, conservative attire. Treat everyone in the office with politeness and respect, and take the situation seriously.If your school has a uniform, plan on wearing that – even if your hearing doesn't take place on a school day, or a time when school is in session.
Otherwise, dress as you would for a job interview or a respectful ceremony such as graduation.
Stand up straight and look the principal or hearing officer in the eye. Don't speak unless you are asked a question or told you can speak.
If the principal asks you a question, stop speaking and answer him or her immediately. Don't resume talking until the principal signals for you to continue.

, Whether it is in front of an independent officer from the school board or your school's principal, a school suspension hearing typically opens with a description of the incident that led to the disciplinary action and the school rules you've been accused of violating.Pay attention, and be mindful of your body language. Hold your hands behind your back if you're prone to fidgeting. You don't want to cross your arms and appear defiant.
You also want to avoid sighing, rolling your eyes, or otherwise looking as though you don't care about what's being said.
Don't interrupt, even if you disagree with something that was said. You will have a chance to speak later, but if it simply can't wait, raise your hand. The principal either will ask what's on your mind or tell you to wait.

, You will have the opportunity to speak in your own defense and provide any explanations, excuses, or evidence that supports your statements. Speak slowly in a calm manner and stick to the facts rather than attempting emotional appeals.When you're speaking, address the principal either as ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" unless your school has a specific mode of address preferred for administrative officials.
Refrain from using casual phrases or slang as much as possible, and avoid curse words at all costs.
If you're interesting in alternatives to suspension, such as community service, express this interest to the principal. Keep i mind the principal probably doesn't want to suspend students either, if he or she has any alternative that will achieve the same goals.
Express your regret for your role in the incident where appropriate. If there are people harmed as a result, you might mention any actions you've taken to make amends with those people.

, After discussing the matter with you, the principal or other hearing officer will decide whether to uphold the suspension or employ some alternate means of punishment. Typically they'll let you know the decision right away, although you should also receive written notice in the mail a few days later.If the principal or hearing officer decides to go forward with the suspension, you typically will get information regarding how you can appeal that decision.
You only have a limited period of time to appeal the decision. An appeal may be a good idea if you believe you were unfairly suspended, or if there was evidence or information you weren't able to discuss at the informal hearing.
Even if you will have already served out your suspension by the time your appeal is heard, a successful appeal can keep the suspension off your permanent record, so it won't continue to affect you in the future.

Get permission from the headteacher.,
Find squad members.,
Assign roles.,
Find a headquarters.,
Hold meetings in your headquarters.","How to Form a ""Squad"" to Fight Truancy"," Before you go chasing after truants, you need to get permission from your headteacher. This is because you will be spending a lot of time outside of your lessons and you may look like you're a truant yourself. If you feel that your headteacher isn't going to allow you to do this, consider writing a petition explaining how bad the situation is and that you'd like to do something about it. Try to get 150-250 signatures before handing it in. It would really help if you can get some teachers to sign the petition too. Here is an example of what the petition would look like:


The below students feel that truancy is a huge problem in our school. Pro-truancy gangs are forming. This lowers the morale of the overall school. Not only do they avoid their lessons, they also hide behind buildings and smoke. This makes our school look bad and we'd like something done about it. are willing to form a squad and help to get rid of these particular students.;
, Your squad will be no good if it's just you on your own. Ask your friends if they want to join. Everybody will need to be able to work in a group and have a good reputation. Your squad should have at least 6 members but no more than 10 because when you get too many members, the squad becomes harder to control and you have to assign more roles to people. This could leave you with a bunch of useless roles. If you can't find enough people, advertise by posting in the school newspapers, sending out emails or putting up posters.

, Below are a few roles for your groups followed by their jobs. The ones in bold are definitely needed.



Leader. The leader organises meetings, assigns roles and fires or hires people. This is the person that everybody will report their findings to. The leader has the most power in the group and can decide what everybody does. They will also choose the routes that the patrollers will follow based on what they've reported. For this reason, the leader needs to be a fast thinker, good at making decisions and good at judging if people are good for the job or not. They also need to have good attendance records.
Assistant leader. The assistant leader helps the leader to make decisions and takes over meetings if the leader isn't present. If there is too much work for the leader to handle, their assistant will take over. The assistant has to have the same qualities as the leader and they also need to be good at finding information to report. If the rest of the group can't find the leader, they will present their findings to the assistant leader.

Patrolman. You will need at least three patrolmen or patrolwomen. This is the most dangerous job of all. These people walk the halls looking for truants, patrol the school grounds and report illegal groups and activities to the group leader/assistant. Because they will be out on the front line, the patrolmen/women need to be strong, a quick runner and have good communication skills. If possible, they will try to deal with the truants themselves. They should only attempt this on their own if there is no more than two truants.
Cleaners. It's the cleaners' job to keep headquarters nice and tidy. That means making sure there's no rubbish on the floor, straightening the leader's papers and leaving the room generally clean before they lock up. The cleaner doesn't have to always turn up for meetings so anybody with bad attendance can have this role. The cleaner might be scared of the truants if they're in a lower year so this job is perfect while they get used to being in the anti-truancy gang.

, This will be the place where you will work and hold meetings. The leader should be able to be found here by any other squad-mates. Any classroom will do but it needs to be spacious and have enough room for all of you to work. It will also need to fit a round table so you can all see each other in meetings. If you're allowed to keep the room, feel free to hang anti-truancy posters, invest in a drinks machine and buy a filing cabinet to keep all of your work in. In short, make yourself at home!

, The patrollers need to present what they found when they were scouting. This includes regular truants, illegal gangs and popular hideouts. They might have some CCTV footage or digital photos to show the rest of the gang. The leader and their assistant should then decide if they're going to send a large group of patrolmen to deal with the truants or report more serious gang activity to a teacher. Keep doing what you do and eventually there will be no truants left.

Don't overreact when the school contacts you to inform you about the suspension.,
If you don't get all the information you want at the first contact, don't be afraid to call back for further details.,
Don't be quick to blame the school.,
Make sure they do not set foot in the school grounds for any reason while on suspension unless supervised by you; for example to pick up a sibling from school or to attend a club meeting.,
Make sure each day still has a strong routine.,
If the school has left school work for the child to do, make sure all of it is completed.,

Don't expect your child to talk about it right away.,
Discuss what happened with your child(ren).

,

Make sure your child understands why the behavior was wrong.,
Make sure your child understands what the future consequences of their actions could be.,
Follow up with the school as needed.",How to Deal with Your Child Being Suspended from School," Ask as many questions as you can. Find out the following information:


What the child has been suspended for
What exactly happened
Why suspension has been the chosen punishment
Were other students involved in the incident, and if so, have they also been suspended; if not, why not
How long will the suspension last
What your child will be expected to do during the suspension
How this will affect your child academically;
, The schools much prefer an involved parent who wants to know what is happening to their child over a disengaged one.

, Suspension is a very common punishment in schools. In some schools as many as 30% of students are suspended each year. It does not mean your child is being rejected.

, If they are doing extracurricular activities at school usually they will be banned from doing these while on suspension. Some schools will call the police if a suspended student is on school property; however, most will force the parents or guardians to pick them up as soon as possible.

, It is easy to let it become a matter of sleeping in and doing nothing all day. This will just make their return to school harder. Have a set time to get up each day and if the school has not set work to do, set some of your own. There are lots of online resources available.

, This will help your child's return to school. They will not be as far behind on their classwork, and the school will be more willing to have them return to normal schedule.

, Take away their privileges and possessions such as watching TV, using the computer (unless your child needs to do research and/or projects assigned during suspension days), and going out with friends. This also applies if there will be a break between suspension days such as weekends, holidays, class suspension, etc.

, They may be angry, upset or emotional about what happened, or possibly even gloating about it. You will probably be angry and upset too. Talking about it straight away can lead to a pointless battle. Wait until you both calm down (perhaps the next day) to discuss the issues.

,, Role playing often helps with this. Many kids will not want to participate, but cooperative participation can be linked to their punishment.

, Don't assume that they do understand why; teens and kids can be very self-centered and they don't always see how their behavior can negatively affect others.

, They could hurt themselves, and they could hurt others. If they repeat the behavior, they could be expelled from school.

, Upon reentry to school, you may be required to attend a meeting to discuss how further behaviors will be prevented. Often the school will impose further sanctions such as a loss of participation in sporting teams, a behavioral contract, or a behavior monitoring sheet.

",How to Deal with Your Child Being Expelled from School in Australia," Expulsion from school means that the child is no longer allowed to attend school at that institution. This is different from suspension where the child is banned from attending school for 1-20 days.


There are different types of expulsions from school. The main two types are expulsion and cancellation of enrolment. Most students are expelled from school but if your child's enrolment is cancelled this is a special consequences which only applies to students who are older than compulsory school age who are not participating in their education program, for example truanting or not doing work.
Expulsion can be for up to a year or permanent. Most expulsions from school in Australia are permanent. But some schools may choose to expel for up to a year. This is more common in rural areas where there are not many schools for a child to attend so it's not an easy option to just enroll in another year.
Most expulsions in Australia are from just one school but a child can be expelled from a group of schools or even all schools in their state.
Schools can expel kids for disobedience, defiance, misbehaviour, drug offences, truancy, failing to wear correct uniform, bullying, assault, swearing, verbal abuse, property damage, disruptive behaviour, criminal behaviour and so on. Most offences that a student can commit can be put into one of those categories.
Usually when your child is expelled from school a great variety of other behaviour modification methods have been tried first. This may include detention, community service, counselling, in school suspension, out of school suspension, behaviour improvement contracts and so on. For more severe offences like physical assault, drug offences, weapon possession and similar behaviours the school will usually expel a student without using other methods of discipline first.;
, If your child is to be expelled he or she will be suspended from school for 5 days first with the recommendation for expulsion. The Governor General will evaluate the case and make the final decision as to whether the child should be expelled or not.

, A parent and a child have the right to appeal against the expulsion before it is finalized . You will receive a letter not he first day of the suspension with the information about appealing. Appealing is almost never successful so only appeal if you have very good reason to believe your child is innocent.

, If your child is expelled the first thing you must find out is why. Does your child have an underlying condition that is not being treated, are they victims of abuse, have they gotten in with the wrong crowd, are they suffering with mental problems or substances use. Before you try to enroll your child in another school you need to do what you can to ensure your child is not just going to be expelled again. Often an expulsion from school can be a wake up call that a problem needs addressing.

, In 99% of cases it is best for the student to continue their education. If your child is of compulsory school age they must continue their education. This is if they are under 16 and have not yet completed year 10. If they are over 16 or have completed year 10 but are under 17 and have not completed year 12 they are in the compulsory participation phase, this means they must be in full time education or have a full time job.

A good student is one that is prepared, active, safe, interacting, and helping. In the first few days of school the expectations are generally made quite clear either verbally, in a syllabus, or written in an agreement. In general, the expectations are:


Listen to your teacher and follow instructions. If you want to behave better in class, the first place to look for help is your teacher. Always do what the teacher tells you during class time. Listen closely to your teacher's instructions, when they tell you to be quiet, to start or stop working, to line up, or do anything else. If you listen the first time, you likely will not have to ask later.






Be Quiet. Typically, any time after class has started, it is time to be quiet. Save the things you want to say to your friends for later. If you have a question about an assignment, raise your hand when appropriate to ask, write it down to yourself and ask the teacher later.






Avoid sitting with friends that get you in trouble. One of the common ways a student gets loud and disruptive is talking with friends. Sit up front to avoid the temptation to chat during class if you can. There's plenty of time to socialize at recess and lunch and after school. It’s also good to avoid bullies and ""fr-enemies"" other people who can tempt you into misbehavior. (You can talk to your teacher about this, and maybe pretend that you ""have to"" sit where you do, to take social pressure off of you.)






Be on time. You need to be in the building when school starts, and you need to be in your seat when class starts. If you're struggling to make it to class on time, looking into time organization skills, material organization skills, and figuring out how much time you really need for transitions.;
, If you have a question, or you have something you want to say, don't just shout it out or direct it at your neighbors. Raise your hand, wait to be called on, and then speak when you've been given permission.


Have something specific and brief to say, so you're not wasting class time rambling. The most appropriate time to raise your hand and speak is when you have a question that other students might have, as well. ""What pages are we supposed to read for tomorrow?"" and ""How do you find the lowest common denominator?"" are both appropriate questions.
Inappropriate questions include things that are particular only to you, or things that are off-topic. ""Why did I get a D?"" or ""What do you think of LeBron James, Miss Johnson?"" are probably both inappropriate (albeit maybe interesting or funny) questions for class. If you want to talk to your teacher about these things, write down your question, and wait until after class.

, If you're given class time to do homework, make sure you use that time doing homework, not as free time. That means work on the assignment that you're supposed to work on.


Don't work on homework for other classes during work time, unless you've been specifically given permission. If you're given time to work on a group project, don't withdraw from the group and sit working on your math homework. You're wasting work time, and the time of others.

, Just letting your teacher know you are trying will go a long, long way! He or she can help come up with a way to improve together. Teachers can help modify the class, such as making clear prompts to what you are supposed to do, or avoiding embarrassing situations which may make you act out.


If you've got a reputation as a trouble-maker, many teachers will be impressed if you're sincere about wanting to be better in class. Making the effort to talk to your teacher is a good first step in changing the way your teacher looks at you.
Get to know your teacher! Your teacher is a person--not just a teacher! He or she has interests, feelings, and opinions. Getting to know your teacher as an individual may make it easier to listen and respond to him or her. Also, your teacher may get to know you as a person, too! This rapport can make working together a lot easier.

, Admitting you have an issue does not mean you are a bad person; you recognize you have a problem. And there are many reasons a student may have behavioral issues. Parents can do a lot in working with the school to get the help you need. It may be as simple as working with your teacher, to testing for Attention Deficit Disorder, to perhaps looking into a charter school.


Charter schools, challenge programs, and other kinds of alternatives may be a better fit for you, if you're struggling with your behavior. Talk to your parents about the possibility of switching schools. If your parents are unwilling to listen, talk to a guidance counselor at your current school about the possibilities.

, If you have trouble paying attention and staying on task, changing your attitude can help a lot. Instead of rolling your eyes and groaning every time you have to learn history, work on your handwriting, or do math problems, try to use your imagination to make the tasks cooler and more fun. It might sound stupid, but pretending your schoolwork is fun can actually make it fun.Don’t “do your math,” pretend to be a rocket scientist learning to plot the paths of rockets, or an astronaut trying to plot your course home from the planet Zebulon 4. Pretend that you're Albert Einstein, cracking the secrets of nuclear energy.
Don't ""practice handwriting,"" pretend that you're translating secret messages from a mysterious government agency, or that you're learning to speak Klingon.
Don't ""do your reading,"" imagine that you're a famous author preparing to give a lecture in front of a crowd of adoring fans, or that you're a supercomputer uploading information into its positronic net.

, One great way to keep yourself focused on the class topics and the lesson is to take notes. Even if you'll be provided with a review, or you don't eventually need the information for the test, if you struggle to pay attention, focus on writing down the important things the teacher says. Don't worry about writing it word for word, just try to come up with a list or an outline of the important things that happen in class. This will help you stay focused and you'll have something to refer to later.Taking notes can also help you improve your handwriting, which can help your grades improve and your relationship with your teacher a lot better. No one wants to read chicken-scratches.
Don't worry about listening to the whole lesson at once, just focus on catching the next important thing the teacher says. Go one step at a time.

, You can't stay focused if you don't have all the necessary supplies ready, and you're in your seat on time. There's nothing worse for your classroom reputation than forgetting your math textbook, or having to ask for a pencil or a piece of paper that you forgot to bring. For each class, it's usually important to have:


The textbook or books for the specific class
A pencil, ink pen, or other writing utensil
Enough loose paper or notebook paper to take notes or complete an assignment
A folder or binder for class materials
Your homework, fully completed

, If you're not in the habit of contributing during class time, try to change up your habits. Raise your hand if you know the answer, and talk during discussions in class if they're going on. Don't talk just to talk, but try to find a way to engage with the topic and the other students in your class, rather than sitting there being bored, or causing trouble., Just like changing your attitude about enjoying your classes, making an active choice to improve your grades can be an important first step in actually getting better grades. If that happens, you might be more invested in the class because, getting good feedback and seeing the results of your hard work.


If you're struggling, find out about tutoring or homework help available at your school. Many schools have free tutoring programs after school that are available to students who want to improve their grades and get a little help, which everybody needs sometimes.

, At school, your friends will have a big influence on your behavior. If your friends are cutting up in class, getting in trouble, and joking around, it'll make it a lot more difficult for you to be on your best behavior. Try to make friends with kids who want to succeed in school, who are well-behaved, and who are fun to hang out with.


The class clowns will always stand out, but that doesn't mean that these students are the best kind of friends you could make. Look to the quiet kids and try to hang out at recess, or sit with someone you don't normally talk to during lunch to find out if you get along.
Don't be afraid to tell your friends that you can't sit next to them because you don't want to get in trouble. If your friends are true friends, they'll understand your desire to avoid getting into trouble and support you.
Sit still. But if you want to behave in class, it's very important that you learn to relax and pay attention to stay on task. The best way to do this is to focus on sitting still. Don't fidget, mess around with the items in your desk, or bother your neighbors. Just sit quietly and listen to the lesson.

, For some students, going to school is the only time to see friends, making it much more tempting to joke around and act out when you're supposed to be studying. To avoid that temptation, try to make a point of hanging out with your friends a lot on the weekends, after school, and at more appropriate times. If you're so busy having fun, you might even start to look on school as a chance to finally sit quietly.


Ask your parents to join up with a sports team or other club if you want to have something to do after school. Chess clubs, music clubs, and lots of organizations are available to students looking to get involved and stay busy having fun outside of school.

, Checking your cellphone is a big no-no in almost every classroom, but it can be so tempting to look! If you just can't stand the thought of leaving those Facebook updates alone, do yourself a favor. Make it impossible. Drop your phone off in your locker before you go to class, so you won't be able to check it even if you want to, or consider leaving it at home. If you absolutely have to keep it with you, shut it off completely.

, Being tired can make lots of students irritated and more prone to misbehavior, including acting out, messing with friends, and even falling asleep in class. Being tired also makes it a lot more difficult to learn effectively. If you get a full night of sleep, though, you'll be ready to meet the day and pay attention in class.


A sleep study at the Harvard Medical School concluded that more sleep means better memory retention.After being asked to memorize a series of random words, respondents who slept more the night before scored more highly on the test. If you want to improve your behavior and your grades, get more rest.
Don't keep your cellphone next to your bed. Lots of kids–up to 10% according to the National Sleep Study–are awakened regularly and distracted in the middle of the night by texts and Facebook updates on cellphones, making it difficult to settle down and fall asleep. If you're struggling with tiredness throughout the day, keep your cell out of reach., Too often, it's easy for students to drink a soda or eat some candy during lunch period, because cutting the eating short makes it easier to hang out with friends. This can mess with your blood sugar levels, though, making it much more difficult to pay attention in the afternoon. If you want to keep your energy up and your attention level high, it's important to eat a healthy meal in the middle of the day.


Falling glucose levels are linked directly to a release in adrenaline, meaning that when your blood sugar dips, your body makes up for it hormonally by running on more adrenaline, making you more irritable and restless.Try your best to avoid the candy and the soda during lunch. Getting all geared-up on sugar means you'll crash in a few hours, making it very difficult to behave in the afternoon.
If you don't like the meals at your school, take some time in the morning to pack a good lunch that you'll enjoy eating. try to eat some fresh fruit and vegetables, like an apple, carrot sticks, or other healthy snacks you enjoy eating.

Stand up straight. People who are lying unconsciously lean back to get away from the person they’re having a conversation with.Don’t stammer or say “um.” These are signs that you’re nervous and making up what you’re going to say. Use strong, clear speech.;
, The teacher or principal might take pity on you if you act upset.

Some schools use something called in school suspension.",How to Cope with Being Suspended from School in Australia," In Australian schools you can be suspended from school from between 1-20 days. The length of the suspension is up to the school and will be decided based on the severity of the offence, the school policies, the type of offense, your age, your grade level, if you have been suspended before and so on.


Australian schools can suspend you for misbehaviour, defiance, swearing, using mobile phones at school, not wearing our uniform, bullying, vandalism, assault, verbal abuse, smoking, drinking, taking or selling drugs, truancy, breaking the law, being charged with a crime outside of school and so on. Some offences for being suspended are very minor and some are very major.
For minor offences you are usually only suspended from school after the school has tried a number of different strategies like detention, community service, in school suspension and so on. For major offences the school may suspend you the first time you do them.
Every school is different in the way they apply suspension. Some school use suspension a lot to deal with even the most minor offences, other schools only use it for major offences. You can see which schools use suspension a lot by looking at the schools website. All schools must put their annual report on their website which will tell you how many students at the school and how many are suspended each year.
Suspensions are divided into two types, short suspension and long suspension. What is classified as a short suspension and long suspension is different in different states. In all states 4 days or less is a short suspension, in all states 11 days or more is a long suspension. But for suspensions of 5-10 days, how it is classified will vary from state to state.
A short suspension may be anything from 1-10 days. A principal can suspend a student on short suspension without approval from the director. Parents can't appeal against a short suspension. Schools are supposed to do their best to provide an ongoing education program for short suspensions.
A long suspension may be 6-20 days. A principal must get approval for a long suspension (it is almost always granted), parents can appeal against the suspension (which is almost never successful). The schools must provide a way for the student to continue their education.
If you are suspended you will be taken to the office and your parents will be contacted. If you are sent home your suspension will begin that day, if not the suspension will begin the next day.;
, Parents and students will be told the details of the suspension. Like why the student was suspended, how many days the suspension will be for, what they will be required to do during the suspension, what they will not be allowed to do during the suspension and what will happen upon return to school.

, This can include more information about what your child did, how it was discovered, if other students were involved, why this punishment has been chosen, if other consequences have been used in the past, what future consequences are likely to be and so on. Schools are usually happy to speak with you about the suspension but don't get too aggressive, they can get scared and become defensive.

, If the suspension is a long suspension, you can appeal. In most cases the authorities will side with the school. Only appeal if you have proof that your child was not involved or due process was not followed.

, If you have a right to appeal the I formation will be in the letter.

, Is there someone who does not work who can supervise the child? Don't leave the child unsupervised.

, Make sure they know what they did wrong, why it was wrong, how it could hurt them or others and what further possible consequences could be.

, Often we don't understand why they did things but they can tell us things we did not realise about they were thinking and feeling at the time. If you yell or become angry most kids will shut down and won't discuss the situation with you.

, Make a plan on how to deal with the situation of it comes up again, so it does not reoccur.

, Many kids who are suspended have underlying disabilities like ADHD, Autism/Aspergers, learning difficulties, gifted issues, vision or hearing problems, health problems, substance abuse issues, depression, anxiety, oppositional defiance disorder, conduct disorder and so on. Use the time your child is suspended to look for help or answers.

, Are they at the right school, in the right subjects and so on. It may be time for a change.

, This will help them not to fall behind in their education and help the school re-accepted them after the suspension.

, If possible contact a friend at the school to find out what the kids are working on.

, Most teens see suspension as a reward and not a punishment. Make sure there is some punishment. Like grounding, loss of privileges and so on.

, This will help to provide them with structure, discipline and control while they are out of school.

, Routine. Make sure they are still getting up and going to bed at the usual time and have a clear structure to the day otherwise it will be very difficult for them to return.

, Most schools will not allow them to attend outside school activities that are related to the school like sporting events but if your child will be involved in any of these find out if they can or not. Don't just assume. Some schools will say yes and others will say no.

, Some parents have tried to enroll their child in another school while suspended. You can't do this, you must wait until the suspension is over to get a transfer. School suspensions will not go past the end of a school year.

, Schools will require the student to go through a renters process. This is usually just a meeting. Some schools may have ongoing consequences for suspended students like not being able to participate in activities like school sports, camps etc. other schools may require them to go onto a behaviour monitoring chart, other schools will have no further consequences.

,, This is not a real suspension and won't go on their permanent record, but it means they can't attend classes. They still go to school and do work under supervision on their own.

Listen attentively to your teacher.,
Follow the teacher's directions.,
Strive for good grades.,
Participate in the class.,
Be quiet.,
Work towards a clean slate.",How to Be Well Behaved at School1," This is the easy and will lay the foundation for the way others view your behavior. When a teacher, principal, or other school official is speaking, be sure to listen carefully or they may cross-question you. Listen even if they're not speaking to you directly (for instance, at an assembly). A teacher's day is spent struggling to win the attention of kids who would rather read books, not talk to friends (but instead listen to the topic), and ignore on their phones and such things during lessons. If you listen intently, she will notice you and begin to think of you as a good student.


Avoid asking your teacher to re-explain things they've just explained in great detail just for fun or to gain her attention or else you may frustrate or anger them. Instead, wait for a moment when you can approach your teacher one-on-one and say something like, ""I'm sorry, I think I need a little more help understanding how to do this.""
If you have any such condition that makes it hard for you to concentrate, remember to take resolve it when you wake up in the morning (such as take a medicine if you are not feeling well) so that you'll pay attention during the lectures and lessons.;
, Teachers like to see that their students are treating them with respect. If you intently follow all of their directions, they may even give you special freedoms or privileges under the assumption that you're trustworthy. In addition to following their verbal directions, read your teacher's syllabus carefully and follow any special instructions you find. Many students forget to study their syllabuses - get one step further than them by paying extra attention.


If, for instance, your teacher said not to enter the classroom before they arrive, but your classmates have gone in anyway, you should wait outside. If you're the only person to follow the rules exactly, you'll stand out in your teacher's mind as a good rule-follower.
Some teachers like to give vague, cagey advice to see who listens and who doesn't. If she/he says something mysterious like, ""be sure to study this weekend,"" take note - she/he might be planning a pop quiz for Monday. You'll make an excellent impression if you are the only one prepared.

, Everyone's academic strengths and weaknesses are different - don't worry if you can't get perfect grades or marks . It's much more important to show your teacher that you're trying your level best. Ask intelligent and sensible questions during class. If there's something you're having an especially hard time understanding, meet your teacher after class.


Your willingness to seek help will show your teacher that you're taking their class seriously. A student who's clearly engaged in the material is more likely to be considered favorably when the teacher is assigning partial credit, tests, re-takes, etc.
If you're struggling hard to comprehend any subject , don't be afraid to ask your teacher for a tutor recommendation. Seeking help when you need it is a sign of maturity which most teachers will admire and prefer.

, Many classes are discussion-centered. The lecture in these classes takes the form of a dialog between the teacher and the students. Try to answer questions your teacher asks the class. Even if you don't answer correctly, you'll show your teacher that you're engaged in the material. If you don't participate, the teacher may think you aren't listening or don't care about the material.


Raise your hand when you have something to say in class. Never blurt out answers! Most teachers get irked when students answer without being called on.

, Don't talk to your friends or otherwise disrupt the class, especially if you're in your teacher's favouritism. Repeated disturbances can infuriate your teacher or even get you ejected from class. Respect your teacher. It should be fairly obvious when s/he wants you to be quiet. If you're not sure, err on the side of quietness or try waiting for another student to talk first, then judge your teacher's reaction.


If the teacher leaves the room, you might get away with talking a little. However, quiet down as soon as they return. Never talk if the teacher leaves during a test - other students might tell about you if you disturb them or try to cheat.

, Not every student who reads this guide will have a history of perfect conduct. If you've behaved poorly in the past, start improving your image immediately. Apologize to your teachers, students, or administrators you've disrespected. If you've been especially bad, bring your teacher a small, modest gift for an upcoming holiday. Devote more attention to your schoolwork. Pay more attention in class. Serve any outstanding detention time, then follow the above steps to keep out of trouble in the future.

Don't waste time in the hallway.,
Stay in the administration's good graces.,
Avoid fights.,
Don't badmouth anyone.",How to Be Well Behaved at School2," Between classes, it's only natural to say hi to any friends you might meet. This is perfectly acceptable for a well-behaved student. However, don't let yourself get distracted talking or goofing off. Keep track of your time and always allow yourself enough time to get to class before the bell. Passing periods can be deceptively short and teachers hate it when a student is late. If you're tardy repeatedly, you might even be subject to detention or other discipline.


If you've got a timer function on your watch or cell phone, use it. Designate a set amount of time - three minutes, for example - that you're allowed to talk with friends. When your timer goes off, wrap up what you're doing and get to class!

, Presidents, deans, and provosts: these school figures aren't teachers, but that doesn't mean you can ignore them and other people in the administration. Anyone who works in an office in the school probably has the ear of the principal or someone else who can discipline you. Be respectful to these people - a good reputation among the members of the administration can be a godsend if you get in real trouble.


Here's one example: many schools have a secretary in the school's office who you need to talk to if you arrive at school late for some reason. Sometimes, this person is annoying, and, because they don't have the power to discipline you, it's tempting to give them sass. Don't do it. They probably talk to the principal every day. Even if they don't rat you out to the principal, they'll make life difficult for you the next time you show up with a poorly-forged doctor's note.

, This one's sometimes very difficult, but it's always very important. Many schools have zero-tolerance policies on fighting - throw a punch and you can easily find yourself suspended or expelled. Spare your permanent record from the threat of black ink. Don't get into fights unless it's absolutely necessary to protect yourself. Even in desperate cases where you have to fight, you run the risk of serious trouble. Teachers and administrators won't necessarily know who started the fight. If it's your word against the bully's words, then there's a good chance you'll both be punished. The best policy is to avoid fights entirely. Here are some tips:



Know how to deal with bullies. Bullies are weak, insecure people who hurt you to feel better about themselves. Try to thwart them without fighting.
Ignore your aggressors. Sometimes, people pick fights for attention or because they're bored or unfulfilled. Ignore these people to make them look like idiots. Headphones can be a great tool for this - just turn your music up.
Tell a teacher or administrator. If you feel like you're being picked on, tell your school's staff, especially if you're worried that your bully will eventually start a fight. If s/he does, you'll be able to say that you tried to warn them about the danger beforehand.
Never instigate a fight. No matter how disrespectful someone is to you, you'll bear the brunt of the blame if you throw the first punch. If you're fuming mad at another student, do whatever you need to do to control your temper - listen to some calming music, eat a big meal, or perform some vigorous exercise, for starters.

, Gossip, especially juicy gossip, can be hard to resist spreading, but you definitely should avoid doing so. Word gets around schools quickly, and if someone hears you've said something nasty behind their back, you'll quickly get an untrustworthy reputation. This goes double for teachers or administrators. Vicious rumors about staff members can put their jobs in jeopardy. If you're caught for starting a rumor about one of the school's employees, your punishment will be severe.


It goes without saying, but spreading gossip is also just a mean thing to do. Before you say something mean about someone, reflect on whether the statement is true or just a rumor. If it's true, think about how it would make this person feel if s/he heard it.

Enroll in extracurricular activities.,
Cultivate a ""good"" appearance.,
Reach out to unpopular people.,
Become a leader.,
Do good outside of school.,
Ignore haters!",How to Be Well Behaved at School3," Your good behavior shouldn't necessarily begin and end in the classroom - most schools have a selection of extracurricular activities you can sign up for. By devoting yourself to your extracurricular, you'll have an opportunity to enlarge your circle of friends (in terms of both students and faculty members) and develop a reputation as a hard worker. Here are a just a few extracurricular your school might offer:


Sports teams
Musical ensembles or bands
Vocal groups
Plays or musicals
Special interest clubs (debate, cooking, robotics, etc.)

, It's sad but true - many students and teachers are shallow - they'll judge you based on your looks. If you really want to get a reputation as a goody two shoes, try to dress and groom yourself so that you look as clean-cut as possible. Avoid ripped denim, baggy pants or jerseys. Don't wear piercings on your face or body. Keep a smile - don't try to look tough or menacing. Sadly, these changes to your surface appearance will cause some people to view you differently.


Boys should be clean-shaven, with a short, conservative haircut. Tend towards button-up shirts and clean, good-fitting pants or slacks. Don't wear earrings.
Girls should avoid ostentatious makeup, revealing clothing (a bare midriff, low-cut shirts, etc.), and excessive jewelry.

, One great way to get a saintly reputation is to go out of your way to be friendly and welcoming to unpopular students. Volunteer to show new kids around the school. If you see someone sitting by themselves at lunch, pull up a chair next to them. Stand up to bullying. You can even try taking social pariahs to school dances. Above all, be a friend to the friendless. You'll definitely be noticed. Plus, it's a really nice thing to do.

, By finding in a leadership role, you have more potential to do good (and a greater audience to notice your good deeds.) Run for student government, start your own after-school club, or become the captain of an intramural sports team. Whatever you do, lead by example - well-behaved leaders can quickly gain the respect and admiration of students and teachers alike.

, Word travels fast at school - the things you do outside of school can affect the way you're seen at school. Be an active volunteer at homeless shelters or charities. Enroll in a community-outreach program. Spend a Saturday building affordable housing through a program like Habitat for Humanity. Become a mentor for an at-risk youth. Encourage your friends to do the same. All of these things will count towards your goal of cultivating a noble goody-goody persona at school.

, It's almost unavoidable - some people are going to resent you for trying to be good at school. Ignore any teasing or insults that might come your way. By doing so, you display maturity and restraint. In turn, you make them look immature. Don't let the haters get to you - the rewards of behaving well aren't worth the instant gratification of retaliation.


Don't stoop to your haters' level by hurling your own insults back at them. The best revenge is to live happily while continuing to do good - it'll frustrate them to no end.

Sit near the front.,
Minimize distractions.,
Take good notes.,
Ask questions.",How to Pass a Class Without Really Studying1," Get to class five minutes early so you can find a seat near the front. Find a seat in one of the first three rows. By sitting in the front, you will be able to see and hear your teacher better. This way, you can pick up on your teacher’s verbal and visual cues that communicate which parts of the lecture material are the most important.Additionally, try sitting in the same seat every time. Sitting in the same seat may help trigger your memory on exam days.;
, Make sure to put away any distractions like phones, computers, iPads and other electronic devices. If you have to, put your phone on silent or turn it off. This way, you can give your teacher and the class material your full attention.Additionally, try to avoid sitting near people who do not pay attention during class since this can be distracting as well.

, Come up with a note-taking system that works for you. Make an outline, type your notes on a computer, draw diagrams, or record the lecture (if it is allowed). Also, don’t write down everything the teacher says. Instead, write down keywords, short sentences of the main ideas, and examples the teacher uses to explain difficult concepts.Additionally, write your notes in your own words by rephrasing what your teacher says when they pause. This will help you remember important concepts better on test day.
Abbreviate words so you can take faster notes, and try to use them consistently so you won’t get confused.

, Whenever you don’t understand a concept, or the teacher says something that is not clear, ask questions to clear up your confusion. Ask the teacher to use a different example or to explain the concept differently. You can also ask clarifying questions about your notes.For example, “Mr. Roberts, in my notes it says that a well-structured essay contains at least five components—an introduction, three supporting paragraphs and a conclusion. Is this correct, or am I missing anything important?”
If your teacher talks fast, don’t be afraid to ask them to slow down or repeat what they just said.

Go to every class.,
Discuss topics with your classmates.,
Participate in class discussions.,
Talk to your teacher.",How to Pass a Class Without Really Studying2," Make sure to attend every class, lab or discussion, even if it is not required. If you skip a class, you may miss out on important information, which is something you cannot afford if you do not plan on studying much.For example, during class, your teacher may give hints about what material will be on the test.
Additionally, by attending optional labs or class discussions, you may be able to get some one-on-one time with your teacher. Use this time to ask your teacher questions about class materials, tests and even extra-credit opportunities.

, Compare your notes with one or two other students in the class who also pay attention, take good notes and ask questions. Discuss discrepancies in your notes and abstract topics to deepen your understanding of the course material.Discussing things out loud will also help you create associations between your personal experiences and the course material, which will help you remember important ideas on exam day better.

, Whenever your teacher puts you and your classmates into groups to discuss topics, make sure to take advantage of this time to work out complex ideas. Additionally, when your teacher asks the class questions, try to answer them even if you are unsure of the answer. This way, you can test your knowledge to see what you think you know and what you actually know., Don’t forget to introduce yourself to your teacher. Let your teacher know what you hope to learn from the class. Also ask your teacher about their teaching style. This will help you prepare for class and take better notes during class.Make sure to use your teacher’s office hours, or to speak with them after class if they don’t have office hours. Use this time to clarify concepts, ask for feedback on your notes (or essays and exams), and to discuss topics of interest.
Alternatively, meet and talk with the teaching assistant (TA) if you are uncomfortable with or intimidated by talking to your teacher.

Ask yourself questions as you learn.,
Draw a concept web.,
Use metaphors to connect unlike concepts.",How to Pass a Class Without Really Studying3," Do this as you take notes in class and learn new concepts. This way, you can make associations between what you already know and what you are learning. When test day comes, the associations will help you remember the material better.Ask yourself, ""How does this concept relate to something I already know?"" ""Does it relate to other data, observations, stories or subjects?"" or ""How does this information relate to the information that I have been learning in class so far?""
Additionally, when you learn a new concept, make sure to ask yourself if you understand it. If you don't understand the concept, then ask yourself more questions about how it fits into what you are learning.

, As you begin to associate new concepts with things you already know, draw webs to illustrate their relationship to each other. Start by writing the new concept in the middle of your notes and draw a circle around. Then draw lines straight out from the circle to create connections to related concepts; these are your secondary concepts. Draw circles around the secondary concepts and create connections to tertiary concepts. Keep doing this until your run out of associations., Metaphors will help you connect seemingly different ideas and concepts to each other. This is a powerful way to remember complex ideas.If you are learning about economic cycles, then try relating it to the formation of a wave in the ocean. For example, as waves slowly form, reach a peak and then crash, so does the economy.

Use songs, rhymes, or acronyms to strengthen your memory.,
Review your notes before class.,
Complete your homework assignments.,
Seek out extra credit opportunities.",How to Pass a Class Without Really Studying4," Use a familiar or catchy tune to make a song out of new ideas and concepts. You can also use rhymes and acronyms to help you remember new material better. Repeat the rhyme or song to yourself throughout the day. This way, when test day comes, you can rely on these mnemonic techniques to help you remember the important information.Make a song out of the important concepts to the tune of the ABC's or Itsy Bitsy Spider, for example.

, The night before class or right before, take ten to fifteen minutes to review your notes from previous classes. Use this time to pinpoint concepts that are still confusing or vague. Write down questions that you can ask your teacher to clear up your confusion.Additionally, write down your reactions or thoughts to the course material. Bring these up in class to engage and create a discussion with your classmates and the teacher. This will help crystalize important concepts and ideas.

, Do this whether it is pre-reading the material, or completing worksheets or practice quizzes. Completing your homework assignments will allow you to assess how well you know the material. It will also help reinforce the material you already understand.As you do your homework, write down questions that you have about concepts that you can bring up in class.

, A few extra points on your exams or final grade may make a big difference between passing and failing a class. Scan your syllabus to see what extra credit opportunities are available. If none are listed, then ask your teacher if they plan to announce any opportunities throughout the semester.If your teacher does not plan on giving extra credit, try asking if you can write an essay about a topic, or a discussion or film that pertains to the course material for extra credit.

Get your kitchen workspace (or a countertop) ready.,
Cut up some organic vegetables, such as carrots, cucumbers, or celery, and put them in a small container.,
For a change, go ahead and make a fruit salad!,
Pick out some fruit.,
Prepare a main meal.,
Make a dessert.",How to Pack an Organic School Lunch," Make sure all the ingredients, utensils and lunchbox are washed, dried and within reach.;
, Or, chop some organic lettuce and put it in a medium container, with a small container of dressing on the side.


Mixing the veggies and the dressing in advance is much better option, though. One good recipe idea is to chop up some cabbage (red or green, but it's a great idea to mix both) and make a mayo and lime dressing. Season with some black pepper and salt. Refrigerate it so that it's cool when lunch time arrives.
Go freestyle! The great thing about this recipe is that you can use it as a base and mix it up however you want. Add anything you like, such as lemon, mustard, peas, croutons, chicken slices, herbs, cheese, tomatoes, anything!
Make your salad as colorful as you can! It's the ultimate golden rule for getting the absolute best of good vitamins in every bite. Like they say, the more the merrier!

, They can be a really juicy and refreshing substitute for normal salad. Plus, if you're making a fruit salad, then you don't need to bring along an extra fruit in your lunchbox.

, Organic peaches, plums, nectarines, bananas, apples, cherries, mangoes, and oranges are all great. You might want to chop the mango and orange to make it easier and quicker to eat at school.


You can also opt to take apples or bananas for school (the traditional option) for school. These' fruit hardly require any time to prep, and it takes almost half the time of it to eat. They also provide an excellent source of fiber, and they pack a great energy boost when you start to feel a little drowsy or tired, which makes them a great pick-me-up!

, Brown rice, stir-fry, chicken, pork, steak, soup, and the traditional sandwich all make great 'stomach fillers'. Try to bring something that can be eaten cold or at room temperature, unless your cafeteria has a microwave that you can use. Try to incorporate good food like salmon and nuts into your main meal.


If you choose a main meal which is versatile, like a sandwich, you can put your veggie salad into it straight away. This saves much more space in your lunchbox. For a healthier sandwich, go for wholewheat bread and turkey meat with cheese. Don't forget to add your salad into the sandwich!

, It can be very easy to make brownies or cookies. Try to avoid store-bought ones though, unless you're really desperate. Not only are they extremely unhealthy, they also make your blood sugar level spike like crazy! You might think, (from previous experiences) that snacks give you the sudden energy boost you need for school, but all they do is just make your sugar levels spike for 30 minutes (at the most), and then they suddenly leave you stark-raving hungry and tired all over again. So, the homemade ones are your best bet.


Try baking cookies or brownies during the weekends. This way, you're getting a nice batch of snacks ready to be eaten the whole week. Smart, eh? You can also persuade your mom to bake her signature (chocolate, crumble, sponge, anything) cake for school! Just help out to make the job quicker and easier for her.
If you want, go ahead and make a berry dessert! Besides being healthy, they also work well as a sweet end to your meal. Just dip some berries (strawberries work best) into melted chocolate-don't go all the way up, halfway up the strawberry is just nice) and roll the chocolate half into ground almonds. This two-in-one dessert (fruit + chocolate) are a great way to bulk up on vitamins without sacrificing great taste. Plus, you don't have to bring other fruits if you bring this dessert to school!

Choose a parent.,
Study a signature sample.,
Practice the signature.,
Sign the real document.,
Hide the evidence.",How to Forge Your Parents' Signatures1," Assuming that you have access to both parents' signatures, the first step will be to choose which parent's signature to forge. Studies have shown that there are detectable differences between male and female handwriting.Therefore, it may be easier to fake a signature of the parent who is the same gender as you, if applicable.;
, Once you've chosen which parent to copy, you'll need a sample of that parent's signature. You probably have many basic handwriting samples of that parent lying around the house, but you need an actual signature. Try looking for a personal check your parent has written for someone, or a receipt he or she has signed.


Observe your parent's letter stylings, proportions, and height ratios. These are the parts of a signature that are often neglected when someone forges another person's signature, and it makes it much easier to catch the forgery.Look for signs of your parent's pen starts and stops, as these can also be telling markers of an authentic vs. a forged signature., Keep your parent's authentic signature close at hand and practice replicating it on a blank, disposable sheet of scrap paper. Pay close attention to the form of each letter, whether the pen is ever lifted (and if so, where), and the overall hand movement suggested by the signature.Compare your practice signatures with the real thing. Keep practicing until you achieve a nearly identical replica.
As you practice your parent's signature, compare the size and length of the two signatures. Most people use the same amount of space to sign their name, no matter what document is being signed. If your replica signature is noticeably bigger or smaller than your parent's, it will be pretty easy to identify as a fake., Once you've adequately practiced your chosen parent's signature and can make a convincing replica, you're ready to move on to the actual signature. Before you put pen to paper, however, you should be aware of the ways in which even a studied signature could be identified as fake.


Hold the pen comfortably. A common trait among people forging a signature is to grip the pen with a tight fist out of nervousness and/or concentration. This produces a very rigid signature, which can easily be identified as a counterfeit.If you must look up to re-examine the actual signature at any point, do not hold the pen to the page. This produces a blot of ink that can be a very obvious sign of forgery.
Likewise, try to avoid breaking the signature (to re-examine the original) between letters or in mid-letter. A sudden change in the signature in which the pen was obviously lifted from the page is a tell-tale mark of a forged signature. Aim to replicate the entire first name in one smooth run, then the entire last name in one continuous signature.

, Once you've signed the document, hide it in a place that your parents will not see it. If you signed your father's name and he sees a document that he has never seen before with ""his"" signature on it, he will immediately know something is not right. You should also return your parent's original signature to the location where you found it. Lastly, be sure to destroy the practice pages you used to learn your parent's signature. Any sign of a sheet of paper with dozens of signatures on it will quickly tip off your parent that you've forged something in his/her name."

Choose a parent's signature.,
Find a sample signature.,
Align the two documents and backlight them.,
Trace your parent's signature.,
Return the original signature.",How to Forge Your Parents' Signatures2," Assuming you have both parents' signatures to choose from, you'll need to decide on a parent whose signature you will replicate. Unlike the simulated signature, tracing will aim to recreate the signature by simply reproducing the authentic signature, so your gender and your parent's gender won't matter.

, Once you've chosen a parent whose signature you will trace, you'll need to find a written sample of that parent's signature. Look for something your parent would need to sign his or her official signature on, such as a personal check, a receipt, or some official document.


If at all possible, find something with a dark, bold signature. This will make it easier to trace that signature through whatever page you will be signing.
Be aware that tracing a signature may leave a second line of ink, or at least an indentation, on your parent's original signature. This evidence will be impossible to conceal, and may even invalidate whatever document your parent initially signed. Use great caution when selecting a signature to trace so that you do not ruin any important documents or leave behind any obvious evidence., The easiest way to trace another person's signature is by aligning the signature line of the un-signed document directly over a sample of the authentic signature. You can do this easily by securing the two documents in place with a paperclip on each side of the document. Be sure that the paperclip extends to cover all four edges of both pieces of paper.Once the real signature is aligned under the blank signature line on the un-signed document, you'll need to provide a source of light behind or under the authentic document. You can do this by holding the two papers (tightly secured to one another) over a lamp shade or on a window (assuming it's light out).
The backlighting is necessary to allow you to see the authentic signature under the un-signed document. Otherwise, unless the un-signed document is printed on thin tracing paper, you will have a very hard time tracing the signature.

, As you backlight the two pages, slowly and carefully trace your parent's signature onto the un-signed document. The traced signature has the advantage of being 100% identical to your parent's, so the height, ratios/proportions, and line starts/stops will look identical., Once you've finished replicating your parent's signature, you'll need to return the original to wherever you found it. If your parent comes into your room and sees a check, receipt, or other document bearing his/her signature lying around, it will be very clear that you're doing something you're not supposed to do.

Find a parent's signature.,
Scan the signature.,
Configure the graphic.,
Scan and ""sign"" document.,
Hide the evidence.",How to Forge Your Parents' Signatures3," If you have access to a computer with a scanner, photo-editing software, and a printer, you can scan a parent's signature into the computer and print it onto the document that needs to be signed. Before you can scan anything, though, you'll need to choose a parent and find a piece of paper with that parent's signature.

, Place the authentic signature into your computer's scanner and save the image as a PDF. Before you click save, however, you'll need to crop the signature to an accurate size. You can play around with the size by enlarging or shrinking as needed, and doing a test print of just the signature to see how it comes out on paper.Choose a name for the saved PDF that will be easy for you to identify but will not be obvious to your parents, should they see your desktop or documents folder.

, If you're using Adobe, you'll need to go to the ""Configure Graphic"" tab and choose the ""Imported Graphic"" button. This should make the File button visible. Click File to finish configuring the graphic so that it can be inserted into a document.If you are not using Adobe, you can skip this step.


Navigate to the ""Select Picture"" dialogue box and open the PDF you saved of your parent's signature. Then go back to ""Configure Signature Appearance"". You can make some fine-tuning edits to the signature under ""Text Properties,"" or deselect all the boxes under ""Configure Text"" to create a more accurate digital image of your parent's signature.

, The easiest way to print the now-scanned signature onto the un-signed document is to also scan the document and insert the signature into that image. Otherwise, you can make copies of the document and put them into the printer, but it will take a lot of trial and error to align the scanned signature in the proper place on the document.


Once the document is signed, you can import the signature. Either edit it in with the editing software, or use the digital signature function, depending on the software you have at your disposal.
If the signature looks good and is in the right place, print it out and see how it looks on paper. Make any adjustments you need to on the computer and re-print as necessary.

, Return your parent's signature to wherever you found it. You should also remember to destroy any printed copies of the ""signed"" document that you will not be using.

Buy a pantograph.,
Find and trace a signature.,
Hide the original signature.",How to Forge Your Parents' Signatures4," A pantograph is a crude copying device used to create duplicate documents or signatures. Thomas Jefferson used a version of the pantograph, called a polygraph, to create a second copy of every letter he wrote. Similar machines/devices are variously called auto-pens or writing machines, and produce an identical signature when perfectly traced over an authentic signature.You can buy a pantograph online, or build your own by connecting two pens by a straight piece of wood or plastic, though a purchased pantograph will probably be more accurate.

, The beauty of a pantograph is that it will create a perfect replica of any signature you create. For the purposes of forging a parent's signature, however, you can also trace over an existing signature to create an identical duplicate.


You may want to take the ink cartridge out of the tracing pen so that it does not draw over your parent's existing signature, or use a signature that is not important and can be discarded (like a credit card receipt from an insignificant purchase).
Try tracing the signature onto a blank scrap of paper before you attempt to ""sign"" the actual document. This will ensure that you get the signature's motion and fluidity down correctly.

, If you borrowed a check, receipt, or document to trace your parent's signature, it's important that you return it where you found it. Be sure that your tracing does not invalidate any important documents, and use caution to cover your tracks.

Write a note if you are packing a lunch for your spouse or children.",How to Make Bag Lunches Less Boring," Your lunch does not have to travel in a traditional lunch box or brown paper bag.


Use a thermal lunch bag that is insulated to keep perishable items cold.
Look for colorful designs and patterns that match your personality, or your child's personality if you are packing lunches for school.;
, Try a different kind of bread, such as whole grain, rye, or even a pita or a bagel.


Use different lunch meats such as peppered turkey, prosciutto, spicy ham and sliced pepperoni. Your cheese could be something other than pre-packaged American cheese, like mozzarella or provolone or swiss.
Dress your sandwich with interesting toppings and condiments. Try hummus or spicy mustard instead of mayo, add cucumbers or spinach instead of lettuce and try a few slices of marinated peppers or a handful of sprouts.

, If you have something delicious saved in the fridge from last night's dinner, pack it for lunch if you have access to a microwave and can heat it up.

, If you eat salads with dinner, pack your lunch salad at the same time you are making your dinner salad to save time.


Add tasty salad toppings, such as veggies, fruits and protein such as chicken, steak, shrimp, tuna and eggs.
Pack a bottle of dressing or pour it into a small container. If you like some crunch, pack croutons, almonds or other crunchy toppings in a small bag to add to your salad before you eat it.

, Sides can make a boring lunch fun.


Pack different fruits and veggies. Instead of the standard apple, try some dry apricots or fresh mango. Leave the carrot sticks at home and pack sliced jicama or grape tomatoes you can eat with chunks of mozzarella cheese.
Include some great dipping sauces and spreads. Ranch dressing or hummus are great for veggies, peanut butter is good for celery and apples

, Pack 2 or 3 cookies, a brownie or whatever will satisfy your sweet tooth.

, Skip the bottled water, especially if you can get water at work or school. Pack a raspberry iced tea, lemonade or a seltzer with a twist of flavor.

, If you do not have the time to make a sandwich or a salad, use whatever you have in your kitchen. Pack mini muffins, yogurts and even cereal.

, Nuts are far more interesting and a lot healthier than a bag of chips or pretzels. Try almonds, walnuts, pecans or sunflower seeds.

, Instead of a standard peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cut off the bread crusts, flatten the bread and roll it up after you spread the peanut butter and jelly on it.

, This will give them something to smile about when they open their lunch. Throw in some stickers for your kids or a picture of your family pet.

Look for a lunchbox that is the right size for their age.,
Let your teen pick their own lunch box or bag.,
Get leak proof containers.,
Prioritize healthy food.,
Try to combine your teen’s favorite food with something healthy.,
Pack dips to go along with vegetables or fruits.,
Always include healthy snacks.,
Bake or cook with your teen.,
Try to include a water tumbler or thermos in your teen’s lunch.",How to Pack a Lunch for a Teenager," Your teen may want a lunch box that is not too big or hard to carry, but the most important aspect of the lunch box will be its size. You want to make sure the lunchbox can carry a lunch with the right amount of calories according to your teen’s gender, age, and height. The capacity of the lunchbox can be calculated in relation to the amount of calories per a meal your teen should be eating.Teenage boys, ages 13-19 years old, who are 160-171 cm (63-67 in) tall should have lunches that are 885-920 calories per a meal. So they should have a lunch box that can hold 900 ml.
Teenage girls, ages 13-19 years old, who are 155-158 cm (61-62 in) tall should have lunches that are 685-770 calories per a meal. So they should have lunch box that can hold 600-700 ml.;
, Now that you know how large and how much weight the lunchbox should be able to carry, let your teen choose a lunch box based on their preferences, or what they consider stylish or cool looking.Teenage boys may go for plainer, more neutral colors, and teenage girls may go for lunch boxes with bright colors and patterns or designs. Your teen may also just prefer a simple brown bag, which is fine, as long as it is the right size.Go shopping together at Bed Bath and Beyondor Walmartto find a lunchbox.

, Look for containers that have rubber seals as these prevent the food from spilling or leaking., Packing a healthy lunch for your teen will ensure they get the right nutrition every day. If your teen does not have a packed lunch, they will likely buy fast food, which generally is not very nutritious.Prepare lunches that are rich in vitamins and minerals. Include foods that are rich in nutrients like: iron to prevent exhaustion, found in lean meat, leafy vegetables, etc.; zinc to prevent sickness, found in lean beef, eggs, etc.; and omega-3 to prevent heart disease, found in salmon, tuna, etc., This will serve as motivation for them to eat and enjoy their lunch.


Say your teen’s favorite protein is chicken. Instead of packing just fried chicken, make chicken wraps using pita bread filled with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, and cheese.

, As some teens can be picky-eaters, make lunch fun for your teen by preparing fruits and vegetables like steamed carrot, potato, and broccoli with sour cream dip or strawberry, apple, and grapes with yogurt dip.You should also try including other dips based on what your teen likes, such as spinach dip, caramel dip, cheddar dip, etc.

, Snacks are a great way to make sure your teen has something to eat throughout the day when they are hungry. Pack healthy snacks like whole-grain breads, cereals, granola bars, rice cakes, etc., This way you can both collaborate on recipes or new lunch ideas together, and your teen gets a chance to be help you cook or bake something they enjoy eating. Baking and cooking are also great ways to spend quality time with your teen.


Make sure you incorporate healthier options into your own recipes. For example, if you and your teen are making pizza, use ingredients like broccoli, tomato, and spinach.

, Depending on your teen and the size of their lunch box, try to include a tumbler for drinks.


The tumbler doesn’t necessarily have to contain just water. You may opt to fill it with fresh fruit juices for added nutrients and their detoxifying effects on the body.Experiment with juice combinations made from fruits and vegetables. Let your teen try these combinations first before you pack it for them as you want to make sure they will enjoy them and not waste them or throw them away.
Some juice combinations you may want to try include: apple + pear + pineapple, celery + spinach + tomato + dill, pineapple + watermelon + mango + orange bell pepper, etc."

Pack sandwiches or wraps.,
Make some soup.,
Pack some pasta or rice.",How to Make a School Lunch1," A school lunch should include every food group and sandwiches and wraps are a perfect way to get started.Branch out from plain peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and use healthier ingredients like meat, cheese, and vegetables. Try some of these:


Use whole grain breads and tortillas for the healthiest outcome.
Meat, cheese, and eggs work well together.. A cheesy egg bagel and a breakfast burrito are just as delicious at lunch time.
Grilled chicken with lettuce and bell peppers, topped with dressing.

Bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich. Also known as “BLT”, these three ingredients can make a delicious sandwich when combined.
If meats and cheeses are out of the question due to your lifestyle, do not fret. Equally nutritious sandwiches or wraps can be made from vegetables, nut butters, beans, and tofu.;
, Soups are a diverse food that are easy to pack and make. They are also a healthy source of nutrients and can be reheated once your child gets to school.Pack the soup in a thermos or other waterproof container, that way it can’t leak! Try these combinations out:



Classic chicken noodle soup. Combine chicken broth with flat noodles and cooked chicken.

Tomato soup. Also include a grilled cheese sandwich for dipping.

Cream of vegetable soup. Include some crackers to break up and sprinkle in.
Bean and ham soup. Combine navy beans, ham, and assorted vegetables.

Combine Mirepoix with some meat. Mirepoix is a common mixture all around the world of equal parts onion, carrot, and celery. Use it as a base to form a hearty stew with any additional ingredients.

, On their own, rice and pasta are filling and easy to make, but they are rather lacking when it comes to key nutrients.Combine them with meat or vegetable sauces to make a unique and filling meal that can take many forms:



Macaroni and cheese. This familiar dish can be combined with sliced ham, hot dogs, or even baked beans to make it more nutritious and filling.

Spaghetti. Regular noodles can be combined with marinara or alfredo sauce and meatballs. Mix it up by using different kinds of noodles with crazy shapes or cheese filled noodles like tortellini.

Stir fry. This dish can be a bit tricky to learn, but is definitely worth it. Fry up some chicken or beef with carrots, onions, broccoli, peppers and peas then serve on top of white rice.

"
Add whole fruits.,
Pack peeled and sliced fruits.,
Pack sliced vegetables and dip.,
Include nut mixes.,
Avoid unhealthy snacks.",How to Make a School Lunch2," They contain valuable nutrients like vitamin C and potassium that are important to a balanced diet.Whole fruits like apples, oranges, pears, peaches, and plums can also be replaced by smaller bunches of berries like strawberries or blueberries. Fruits should be placed last into the lunch, that way they do not get squished..


While bananas are very healthy, they have a tendency to make nearby food taste like bananas too (even when in a sealed containers).Consider leaving them out unless you really like the taste of bananas.

, Sliced fruits will not last as whole fruits, but they are much easier for your child to eat during a limited lunch period. You can cut up a melon, pineapple, or even deseed a pomegranate to make a refreshing treat. They should be packed in a sealed plastic bag or container to preserve them longer.

, Carrots, celery, cherry tomatoes, and cucumbers are all easily prepared and include an important variety of nutrients.While tasty on their own, you can also include some kind of dip like dressing, hummus, or peanut butter to make them taste even better.

, Nuts like almonds, pistachios, cashews, and peanuts contain protein and healthy omega-3 fatty acids.Not only do nuts provide nutrition and make your child feel more full, they can also function as a crunchy snack food for munching that is healthier than chips or candy.

, Chips, candy, and microwave popcorn all seem like easy lunch fillers, but they contain very little nutritional value.While you should not pack them often, feel free to occasionally surprise your child with tasty treats for special occasions or just to add a little variety."

Pack a water bottle.,
Consider milk and 100% juice drinks.,
Avoid sugary drinks.",How to Make a School Lunch3," Water bottles are a convenient alternative to getting up throughout the day and going to a drinking fountain. Encourage your child to drink lots of water because it has many health benefits, including keeping them more awake at school.You can include this in either a backpack or the lunch itself.

, Both regular and non-dairy milk are healthy inclusions in a balanced lunch. Fruit and vegetable juice drinks are great too, just make sure that you can find “100% Juice” written on them somewhere, as those are far healthier than regular juice drinks., Sodas, energy drinks, and even sweetened ice tea all contain far more sugar than your child needs to be consuming. These drinks can lead to early tooth decay, weight gain, and an energy crash later in the day.This does not mean you should never include them in a lunch, just save them for special occasions to surprise your child and add some variety.

Pick out a lunchbox that is the right size for your child.,
Check to make sure that your child can open the lunchbox easily.,
Consider using a lunchbox that has separate containers for different types of food.,
Get a box that is insulated.,
Consider getting your child a thermos.",How to Pack a Lunch for a Toddler1," If you have a young child who is going to kindergarten or preschool for the first time, it's a good idea to pick out a lunchbox that won’t be too difficult for your child to carry. At the same time, you should make sure that the lunchbox can fit all of the food that you want to send to school with your child.


Check to see if the lunchbox can fit three or four food items, as well as a drink.
Make sure your child can carry the box without difficulty.;
, Some lunchboxes seem like they were made to contain top secret information, rather than your child’s lunch. You should make sure that the lunchbox can be opened easily.


Lunchboxes with zippers work well to contain your child’s food and can also be opened easily. There are also metal lunch boxes that have easy-to-use clips.

, Some lunch boxes come with separate containers or are sectioned off so that you can keep foods from mixing.


This can be helpful if you pack your child something, like applesauce, that might spill.

, If you are planning on packing your child food that needs to be refrigerated, you should get an insulated lunchbox. This will keep perishable food from spoiling.


Some lunchboxes have compartments that are specifically designed to contain either hot or cold food.

, Thermoses can be great for hot or cold beverages. They can also allow you to pack soup for your child, as the thermos should be able to keep the soup hot until lunchtime.


Do not purchase a thermos that is too large, as your child may find that it is difficult to carry it if it weighs a lot.

Make sure your child gets protein every day.,
Include carbohydrates in your child’s lunch.,
Make sure your child gets plenty of vitamins, minerals, and fibers.,
Include dairy products that give your child calcium.,
Send food that your child likes.",How to Pack a Lunch for a Toddler2," Protein helps your child to grow. They also help in the production and renewal of cells. Consider making your child a sandwich that contains proteins. Foods that contain protein include:


Meats like turkey, beef, pork, and chicken.
Fish like tuna, salmon, and halibut.
Cheese like mozzarella and cheddar.
Tofu, beans, and eggs.

, Carbohydrates, or carbs, help to boost your child’s energy levels. However, there are some carbs that are better than others. Avoid giving your child simple sugar carbs like candy. Instead, give your child complex carbs like:


Whole grain products like whole wheat bread, or whole grain pasta.
Brown rice.
Green vegetables like spinach.
Starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes or corn.
Lentils, beans, peas and other legumes.

, Vitamins and minerals can help to boost your child’s immune system and keep their body functioning properly. Fiber helps to keep your child’s digestive system running smoothly.


Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

, Calcium helps to build strong bones and teeth. It is an important part of a growing child’s diet. Choose low-fat dairy products to give your child, rather than whole-fat. Some dairy products include:


Yogurt and cheese.
If you pack milk, make sure it is in a thermos where it will not spoil.

, While keeping nutrition in mind is important, you should also think about what your child likes to eat. If you struggle to get your child to eat certain veggies at home, it is very unlikely that they will eat that particular veggie at school when you are not there.


Send the food that you child loves and will definitely eat without your supervision.

Open up packaged foods that your child may have a hard time opening.,
Cut items up into bite-sized pieces.,
Peel your child’s fruit if necessary.,
Pack small portions.,
Pack cutlery if your child uses it.",How to Pack a Lunch for a Toddler3," If you purchase packaged food, make sure that you open it and put it in a separate container. Many packaged foods may be difficult for your child to open.


If you give your child a juice carton, make sure that it has a straw.

, When packing your child’s meal, keep in mind that your child may struggle with large pieces of food. Because of this you should cut larger pieces of food up into child-sized bites.


For example, consider cutting your child’s sandwich in half to make the sandwich more manageable.

, Your child may find if difficult to peel an orange or tangerine. If you pack a food that your child needs to peel or prepare, do the preparation before sending your child to school.


For example, if you want to give your child an orange, peel the orange and put it in a container that your child can open easily.

, In order to make sure that your child does not waste any food, make sure to pack child-sized portions. After the first couple of times packing your child’s lunch, ask them if they have too little or too much food.


Make adjustments and then check back in in a couple of days.

, If your child uses spoons and forks, make sure to pack one in the lunchbox if you pack food that cannot be eaten with your child’s hand.


Consider packing plastic forks and spoons that are less likely to matter if they get lost or forgotten at school.

Prepare a proposal.,
Write a paragraph or two on why you want vegetarian food added to the school's menu.,
Prepare a list of vegetarian food to show to the school board as an example.,
Present the list in an easily readable format.,
Print out the letter/ proposal and the list of vegetarian suggestions, if you typed them.,
Give the suggestion to your teacher or principal.,
Wait for an outcome.",How to Convince the School Board to Add a Vegetarian Option to the Lunch Menu," For this proposal, you'll need to write a cover letter that sets out the request, the reasons for the request and the facts backing up the request. As part of this request, it is suggested that it will be highly useful to include a list of suggested vegetarian foods to help the school board better understand what sorts of food might be on offer if this is agreed to.


Most of all, keep in mind that when you make a request, you want to give sufficient information to make the decision both obvious (in your favor) and easy to make (in your favor), so it must be well researched and well presented.;
, Make sure it's convincing by including information about such things as:


The types of food that it would be good to offer. See the next section for a suggested list format for this.
How often vegetarian food options should be offered and whether veggie options should be rotated or offered as the same each day, etc.
The health benefits of vegetarian food for all those who might eat it.
How providing vegetarian food is inclusive of all students. Find and quote statistics about the amounts of people who eat vegetarian in your country or area. You could even conduct an informal poll to find out how many students in your school eat vegetarian food regularly.
Find out what other local schools do and if they have vegetarian options, explain this in your proposal.
Is there any other media that might support your point, such as video, photos or news items?
Any other relevant things that you can think of. Ask the other vegetarians in your school for their ideas and points.

, For this list, choose vegetarian options that you know are healthy, affordable and easily produced. This may include typical vegetarian mainstays such as veggie burgers, bean burritos, falafel rolls, high protein salads (such as quinoa or bean salads), hash browns, veggie pizza, and so forth.


Talk to a nutritionist if it is possible. Getting the advice of someone qualified to make healthy food recommendations will be looked upon favorably by the school board, as the members will want to know if the options suggested are nutritious.
If possible, include a price list that breaks down the costs involved for the items suggested. Again, the school board will find this useful because they'll want to keep costs down as much as possible.

, You might like to include images to help the school board members visualize the types of food you consider would be appropriate to include in the school lunches.

, Staple the whole proposal together so that none of the pages go missing.

, Alternatively, your school may have a suggestion box, so put it in there if you want to. Ask the front office or your teacher for advice on whom to forward this proposal to.

, If your principal is convinced, you may see some vegetarian options on your school's menu in short order. It is also likely that you will be informed directly of the outcome of your efforts.

Request allergy-free tables.,
Ask if your child can sit with friends during lunch.,
Demand that the school make a change.,
Bring in food for the class that your child can eat.",How to Help Kids with Allergies Avoid Isolation at School1," Some schools require children with allergies to eat by themselves to possibly prevent them from eating any of their classmate’s food and having a reaction. Doing so often causes isolation and sometimes ostracism. You may be able to stop that from happening by requesting the school designate allergy-free tables for children with allergies.


Talk to the principal about this request. Let them know that setting aside a few tables for kids with allergies to eat at is far easier than issuing a school-wide ban on peanuts and other common allergy foods, which is something you have the right to do.;
, If your child is the only child sitting at the allergy table, of course they’re going to feel alone. You may be able to prevent this by suggesting the school allow a friend or two to accompany your child. This can only be done, however, if their lunches don’t include anything your child is allergic to.


The school may not want to assume the responsibility of inspecting each child’s lunch. If possible, offer to come in each day to look at the food and decide if it is safe or not in order to prevent your child from feeling isolated during lunch., If your child is isolated because of the school’s policies regarding food allergies, there may be something you can do. Section 504 of the American Disabilities Act allows children with food allergies to have a safe and inclusive education, which means that although they will be protected, they will also be included in events.


It also gives parents the opportunity to create plans with the school as to how the staff should include children with food allergies.
You may suggest that the school have food-free parties and events so that your child can participate. Additionally, you can request that these celebrations are held in the cafeteria, rather than the classroom, as these tables are likely wiped down with proper sanitation equipment, unlike desks., Whenever there is a special celebration at school, offer to make some of the food, if not all of it. Doing so allows you to control the ingredients, so you know your child is safe.


Additionally, it allows your child to be part of the celebration, and not have to eat food that is different from anyone else, which can prevent that feeling of isolation."
"
Inform your child about their allergies.,
Talk to your child’s teachers about food allergies.,
Ask if you can speak to the class.,
Request a meeting with the classmate’s parents.",How to Help Kids with Allergies Avoid Isolation at School2," Your child likely knows a lot about their allergies, but they may not know what to say when they are questioned about it. Preparing them with a response when they are offered food can prevent an awkward situation and make them feel more comfortable about their allergy.


For instance, you could coach them to say “Thanks, but I have my own snack,” when they are offered something during school. Or they can say, “Thanks, I’ll save it for later” if they don’t want to turn the food down., In this day and age it seems like everyone should know about food allergies, especially teachers. However, you should still speak with your child’s teacher about their allergies so that they can answer any questions other students have about them.


Children may stay away from your child because they don’t understand what a food allergy is. If your teacher can answer their questions, they may not feel so apprehensive.
Approach the teacher by saying, “I just wanted to talk to you about my child’s allergies. I really want them to make friends and I’m hoping that by talking to you, you may be able to encourage their friendships.”, Talking to your child’s classmates about food allergies can make them seem not so scary or weird. Ask your child’s teacher if you can come in and address the students to educate them about the allergies. If the students know about the allergies and that they shouldn’t be afraid, they may be more inclined to become friends with your child.


For instance, you could read stories about food allergies or show fun videos that explain them. You can also hold a question and answer session with them to help them see that they can be friends with someone who has a food allergy., Some parents don’t like the fact that they have to tailor their kid’s lunches to other children’s needs. Because of this resentment, they may speak negatively about your child to theirs, which can lead them to not want to become friends.


If you discuss the allergies with the parents one-on-one, they may better understand your child’s allergy and not be so upset about it.
During the meeting, expect some resistance from some of the other parents. Offer suggestions on how they don’t have to do too much to their school lunches to keep your child safe. Again, show videos and share information that can make them more comfortable with you and your child and hopefully it will make their children more comfortable with yours.
Also, reiterate how dangerous exposing the allergens to your child could be. Knowing the severity of the situation may make them more willing to help."
"
Volunteer in the school or classroom.,
Alert the school of any bullying that is taking place.,
Remember to stay respectful.",How to Help Kids with Allergies Avoid Isolation at School3," Your presence may help your child feel more comfortable at school, and possibly more outgoing, as a result. Interacting with your child’s classmates and teachers may also make them feel comfortable with you and, in turn, your child. This could potentially help them to get more friends.


Before the school year starts, talk to your child’s teacher and principal about helping out. If they are hesitant, explain your reasons for why you want to be involved and they may agree to allow you to help., Children who have food allergies are often the victims of bullying. They can be picked on because they are different than the other children. Some bullies have even gone so far as to expose the children to what they are allergic to. Speak to your school’s principal about any concerns you may have and to be on the alert for bullying.


Request a conference with the principal to discuss how they can watch out for signs of bullying with your child and others who have food allergies. Also bring the names and descriptions of any bullying that has taken place so that the school can implement its anti-bullying policies., Although you may believe that it is common sense for the school to adhere to your requests, you also have to remember you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.


It’s important to stay respectful when making your requests, instead of being confrontational and demanding. You should be firm, but at the same time, not hostile or rude. Staying calm and polite increases your chances of the school granting your requests."

Find something to hide the food in.,
Choose your food carefully.,
Sit as far away from the teacher as possible.,
Watch for your teacher's eyes.,
Chew as quietly as possible.,
Bring a water bottle for when you get thirsty.,
Enjoy your snack, and pick up after yourself.",How to Eat In Class," Carry along a tote bag, backpack, or jacket to store the food in. A baggy sweatshirt or other clothes can work too.;
, Bring small sized food that fits in your mouth easily. Do not bring big foods or foods that you know make sounds. Avoid bringing messy food. Try jelly beans, hand-held jello, chocolate chips, etc.


Opt for little foods that you can hide in your hand on the way to your mouth--raisins, nuts, jelly beans, M&Ms, etc., and food that won't crumble or make noise (crackers are generally not a good idea).
Also, greasy food can stain your notes and make your binders all slippery.

, Try turning sideways and popping your food into your mouth when your teacher is not looking. You could also pretend to cough and then pop the food into your mouth while covering. Dropping your pencil and eating the food then could work too. Break your food into bite-size chunks under the desk if it is too large.


Just be careful. Doing motions that cause distractions, like coughing or dropping something, are more likely to draw attention to you, not take it away.

, Use the concept of ""light travels in a straight line"". Hunch down and look at your teacher's eyes. Whenever anything blocks your view (e.g. another classmate's head) such that you cannot see your teacher's eyes, it means that he can't see you either. This works well with short teachers and tall classmates.

, Make as little noise as possible and keep your mouth closed. This may mean eating very slowly.

, Most teachers will only allow water, but you can try putting a different beverage in an opaque water bottle before hand. You can also put flavored water or any other clear drink in a plain water bottle. No one will ever know the difference!

, If your teacher finds trash he/she will begin to suspect.

Find visible evidence of unhealthy food regulations.,
Find the facts about what your school/work does to keep your food clean.,
Do an inspection looking for health violations on your own, jot down the violations.,
Find a supporting teacher/worker of the building and make plans to look for violations for one typical week.,
Once you've gathered that weeks data, make a chart of what foods seemed the most unhealthy or looked old/undercooked.,
Gather all the data and organize it from the oldest to the most recent information.

,
Then talk to a representative who runs the cafeteria and ask if you can have a random health inspection during the month of (insert month).

,
Tell them you found some violations that you can't reveal to them yet until the inspectors approve they are violations.

,
If the person approves, hire two health inspectors and choose a date near the end of the month for them to do a live and official inspection.

,
Show them all the data you collected and what they should focus of looking at.,
After the inspection, send the results to the cafeteria representative and the building manager.,
You have completed the wikiHow but be sure to do extra research on health violations.

",How to Inspect Your School Cafeteria," Maybe a picture of old fruit or milk, perhaps proof that the food has more fat than food. Also record any witness of a cafeteria employee using a dirty cooking tool like a knife.;
, When does an inspector come and checkup the cafeteria?

, EX. ""I saw (insert the employee name here) use dirty hands and touch the fruit"" Keep this inspection private.


If you find that on your independent inspection, you found several health violations, be sure to follow these next steps.

, Buy different foods and see how clean they look or if it looks undercooked (old maybe) before eating them. Check your milk's expiration date and make sure you got it before that day. Remember to take pictures of any suspected food.

, Since you and your friend had different meals all week you can compare what meals were unhealthy.


Now it's time to really crack down on cafeteria health violations.

,,,,, EX. ""You should check out the milk, it was a few days past expiration""

, Be sure to emphasize that you will reveal the information to the public if changes are not made soon.

By using everyday occurrences your audience is familiar with, you can bring people together to find the humor in daily life.A good example of affiliative humor is Jerry Seinfeld. Seinfeld frequently uses personal experiences that others can relate to, like waiting in line at the bank, to highlight his humorous observations. A quick Internet search of one of Seinfeld's routines may give you a better understanding of affiliative humor.;
, This kind of humor uses put-downs or insults aimed at individuals to get laughs from your audience. In some cases, this might involve insulting a member of your audience, but it's important that you understand that some people will respond poorly to this or may become uncomfortable. When this kind of humor is used to threaten someone or do psychological harm, it is considered to be bullying.Two examples of aggressive humor are Joan Rivers and Don Rickles, who have been referred to by some as ""put-down artists."" If you think this style might suit your sense of humor, you may want to do a YouTube search for these, or other, put-down artists.

, Being able to laugh at yourself in a good-natured way is a useful skill and is a healthy way to cope with stress.Beyond that, funny events in your life are often easier for your audience to relate to, which may make the punchline of your humor more effective.John Stewart is well known for his use of self-enhancing humor. In some cases, at the start of a joke, Stewart might say something to the effect of, ""I'm not the brightest guy..."" as a lead in to an absurd realization he has noticed.

, This kind of humor, where you aggressively put yourself down for sympathy or laughs, can sometimes be psychologically unhealthy. In some cases, this kind of humor develops from chronic bullying, where a person makes a joke about themselves before a bully is able.If you would like to learn more about self-defeating humor, you might search the Internet for clips of Rodney Dangerfield, who was famous for his self-deprecatory humor style.

, People can usually sense when a story or situation is not genuine, so try to figure out what feels most natural for you. Think about what you find the most funny and enjoyable. Are you a prankster? Do you enjoy telling jokes? Are you a “ham” who enjoys goofing off?


While you won't know which humor style suits you until you try, you will probably find some things work better for you than others. Don’t be afraid to develop really solid base skills before developing other areas that might be more difficult.

, You and your classmates may have specific tastes, but there are some basic set-ups that almost everyone will find amusing. Seeing opportunity for humor in everyday situations is a big part of being a funny person.



Pain is an extremely common trigger for humor. This is perhaps one of the reasons why the payoff of a joke is called a ""punch"" line, and also why characters like Bugs Bunny and the cast of MTV's ""Jackass"" use physical humor for laughs. For some reason, humans find the pain of others, and the accidents that case that pain, funny.As an example, when you bump your funny bone when you sit down at your desk, exaggerate the effect by howling and rolling around; your over-exaggeration will likely crack up your classmates.
The incongruous is also something humans seem hardwired to find funny.Things that don't seem to be related to what is happening and unexpected responses to events are situations you can potentially strike comedic gold. Incongruity can also work well to deflect anxiety in situations that go wrong: for example, if you do something embarrassing in class like drop all of your papers, calling attention to your mistake (rather than trying to act like nobody noticed) will probably strike people as funny because they don't expect your response., In school, you will probably have two separate audiences: your classmates and your teacher. In order for your humor to appeal to the most people, you’ll need to consider what everyone will find funny. Pop culture references, word play, puns, and physical comedy are often reliable sources of humor.


Observe the “funny” kids at school. What do they do? How do they tell jokes? This may give you some idea of how to reach your audience, but don’t feel like you have to copy anyone.

, Some people will take even playful humor seriously, which could result in feelings being hurt or resentment. Take note of who can take a joke and who gets hurt feelings easily. A huge part of being funny in class is delivering your humor in a way everyone can appreciate.

, While you may want the reputation of “class clown,” it’s important to remember there is a balance between being funny and being offensive. It’s a good idea to stay away from jokes and pranks that hurt or ridicule others. Also, some friends might become annoyed if you're always practicing your humor on them. Remember, you want to be funny, not a bully.


Goofing off in class works best if people know you pretty well. If you're new to the class, start small and build up your humor routine so that people find you funny and not obnoxious.

, There are times when being the class clown will make everyone laugh, and there are times when trying to clown around will upset people. Don’t overdo it, and don’t continue to ham it up if you’ve been asked to stop.


A good comic is usually able to read an audience. If you've brought up a hot button issue, or you can see that your audience isn't in the mood for your hi-jinks, it might be better to save your material for another day.

, Humor comes from a place of truth; it has to feel natural for you if it’s going to be funny to others. Even if you don’t get big laughs at first, try to stay true to what feels comfortable for you.


Some people are just naturally more humorous than others. But don’t worry, even if you struggle with your sense of humor in the beginning, you can learn to communicate your sense of humor with practice., Many professional comedians, like Louis C.K. and Chris Rock, use themselves as the targets of their jokes -- especially the mean ones. This is a process called “aiming up,” and it can put people at ease because they’re less worried that you will make fun of them.Self-deprecation is very common in things like lawyer jokes, which are even told by lawyers themselves! This joke plays on the perception of lawyers as corrupt. An example of this would be: “Why don’t sharks bite lawyers? Because they don’t attack their own kind!”
Self-deprecation is also a good way to disarm attacks from others, like bullies. Humorously acknowledging that you’re bad at science or have ugly glasses takes the power away from people who might try to make you feel bad you about those things.

, People often find an unexpected punchline or a setup that takes a sharp turn very funny. The difference between what they expect to happen and what actually happens can be a source of a lot of laughs.For example, you could ask your teacher if she would punish you for something you didn’t do. If she says no, you can reply, “Great, because I didn’t do my homework.” This joke will be funniest if you actually did do your homework, because then it has two unexpected twists.

, A lot of being funny is sharing experiences with others who understand them. If you target things that a lot of your classmates also experience -- like how hard math is or how bad cafeteria food is -- people are more likely to find you funny. , Own your weaknesses. If you’re naturally clumsy, don’t be embarrassed about it. Make it a feature unique to your brand of physical comedy! People who come across as self-confident are more likely to be considered funny by others., Sarcasm is a classic standby for funny people, and it can actually help exercise your brain!Sarcasm is essentially a “true lie,” which means that it works by saying the opposite of what you mean in a way that’s obvious. For example, when your teacher gives your class a homework assignment, you could say “I don’t think you’ve given us enough homework! Can we have some more, please?”


You can also use sarcasm to respond to sarcasm. If someone makes a sarcastic comment, you could reply, “Wow, sarcasm! So original!” The gap between what you’re saying (“sarcasm is original”) and the meaning of what you’re saying (“sarcasm is not original”) may get a chuckle from anyone listening. Similar uses of sarcasm against sarcasm may be doubly funny, as you’re ironically using sarcasm to critique sarcasm.

, This technique relies on playing with double meanings of words.Oftentimes, you can accentuate this kind of humor by waiting for the right context. For example, if someone tells you, “I’ve got class now,” you might reply “It took you long enough to get some!”


You can also try this with your teacher. For example, if your teacher tells you that you can’t sleep in class, you could reply, “I know, but I bet I could if it were quieter in here.”
This technique works best with people you know. Intentionally misunderstanding people who don't know you might result in hurt feelings, offense being taken, or frustration for others.

, This can even work on your teacher if she is laid-back. While she is speaking, you may think of a more interesting way to finish her thought. For example, if she begins a sentence by saying “When I was a kid,” you could finish her sentence by saying, “Let me guess - you rode dinosaurs!”


When talking to your teacher, try to keep your comments light and unoffensive. If you know your teacher is sensitive about her weight, for example, don’t make jokes about it.

, Part of being funny is making the joke seem effortless. Think of jokes, scenarios, or topics that you find humorous while at home. Then you can practice these jokes in front of your mirror so you can also work on facial cues. Some jokes are funniest when told with a straight face (called ""deadpan"" humor), so try practicing both deadpan and your usual delivery to see which you like best.Keep your jokes and puns topical. A pun like “Without geometry, life is “point”less” might go over well in a math class, but might flop in a history class. A joke like “What happened when the chicken crossed the road? It was poultry in motion” would be funnier in English class than in a science class.

, If the teacher asks you a question, reply with a completely different answer. This can be either a random word like “banana” or an answer to a different question, like, ""The capital of Maine is Augusta!""


Use this technique sparingly! If you do it too often, your teacher may get annoyed with you, or your classmates may think you’re rude.

, Prop humor can work particularly well for pun-based jokes. For example, you could bring a box of Glad Wrap plastic wrap to school. If someone gets upset with you in class, whip out the box and tell them, “Don’t get mad! Get Glad!”


Situational comedy also works well with props. If your teacher often says that you (or a classmate) seem to let everything “go in one ear and out the other,” you could come to school one day with cotton balls taped over your ears. When the teacher asks why, you can tell her that you’re trying to keep everything in!

, For example, you could raise your hand and make a peace sign in class. When your teacher acknowledges you, you can reply that you weren’t asking a question, you were just promoting world peace. The humor here is that your teacher can’t be upset that you were giving a peace sign because then she would be upset with the idea of peace itself.


Physical comedy can be very funny, but remember not to make fun of people or ridicule others. For example, mimicking a disabled kid in your class isn’t funny, it’s just mean.
You may have a gesture, way of dancing, or way of doing something that is different from others. You can use this to your advantage to be physically comedic. When people ask, ""What are you doing?"" you can simply reply, ""Sometimes you just have to dance!""

, Pranks that are mean or hurt someone aren’t acceptable and are considered to be bullying.There are plenty of ways to play pranks that are harmless and hilarious. For example, the senior class of a high school in Maryland hired a mariachi band to follow their principal around for the whole day. She thought it was so funny she put it on Twitter."

Figure out what the soda rules are.,
Ask your teacher if you can drink soda.,
Try another beverage.",How to Drink Soda in Class1," Some schools allow students to drink sodas in class, others only allow water, and some schools don’t let their students drink anything in class. Find out what the rules are for sodas. These rules may also vary from teacher to teacher.Look in your school's student handbook for rules about soda usage. If that doesn't help, talk to a teacher, counselor, or principal.;
, If you are unsure if you can drink soda in class, ask your teacher. Tell them you would like to drink soda in class and that you can concentrate better in class with it. They may say you can drink soda in class, so you can have it out on your desk and drink it whenever you like!


For example, you may say, ""I like to drink soda throughout the day. I was wondering if you allow that in your class.""
You may also tell your teacher, ""Soda helps me concentrate and stay awake in class. I don't enjoy drinking water, so I was hoping that you would let me drink soda in class.""

, If sodas aren’t allowed at school, try drinking something else. You can drink sodas when you are at home, but during school hours, you can drink water, milk, or juice. This may be better for your health since the sugars in sodas have been linked to disease and obesity."

Place soda in a solid water bottle.,
Put clear soda in a water bottle.,
Place the bottle in a snack bag.,
Place soda in a hydration pack.,
Make a pouch at home.,
Sneak sips when the teacher isn’t looking.",How to Drink Soda in Class2," One sneaky way to get away with drinking soda in class is to put it in a solid plastic or metal water bottle. Your teacher can’t see what is inside the bottle. They will think you are drinking water, when you’re really sneaking soda!

, If you can only use a clear water bottle, place clear soda in it. This will look like water unless someone is really close up. Your teacher probably won’t check to see if the bottle is soda or water.You can try Sprite, 7-Up, Sierra Mist, or seltzer water. These are clear.

, If you can have snacks in class but not sodas, put the bottle inside a chip or other snack bag. You can keep the bag in your lap and sneak sips from it when the teacher has their back turned. You can also put a straw in the bottle and drink from the drink hidden in the bag.

, Many sports hydration packs are small enough that you can place them under your clothes, especially if you are wearing a jacket. They come with a tube that you can discreetly stick out of your collar. You can subtly turn your head and sip on the straw., You can make a pouch for your soda at home. Pour the soda into the sandwich bag. Stick a thin tube into the opening of the bag. Zip the bag shut up to the straw, then seal the area around the straw with tape.Hide the bag in your pants pocket and thread the straw up through your shirt.
If you have a shirt with a pouch, then you can cut a small hole for the tube to go through in the pouch and thread it to your mouth.

, You can keep your soda bottle in your backpack so your teacher won’t be able to see it. When the teacher turns their back to write on the board or is sitting at their desk, you can take the bottle out of your backpack and take a quick sip.

So stop cheating and work hard to make yourself and your parents proud.;

Own up to your mistake.,
Show remorse.,
Explain why you cheated.",How to Deal With the Situation when You Are Caught Cheating in a Test1," If you were caught red-handed in the moment, or if your teacher has irrefutable evidence against you, you should confess. The worst thing you can do after being caught cheating is to dig yourself into a deeper hole. While it can be scary to be completely honest with an authority figure, it may be your only choice.It’s also the easier thing to do, because you won’t have to rely on being a good actor or keeping your story straight.


Think about the last time someone lied to your face, and you knew they were lying. Not only did it probably not feel great, it probably also increased your anger. Don’t make your situation worse by lying.;
, You got caught doing something wrong, and you should act sorry.Whether or not you genuinely feel it in your heart, act like you regret your decision to cheat. If you admit that you cheated with a huge smile on your face, you’ll most likely get a harsher punishment simply to teach you a lesson.


Be open about how you feel. If you feel the urge to cry, let those tears flow. The more emotion that your teacher sees from you, the better.
If the authority figure sees that you are upset, they may be more lenient with punishment. Trying to play it cool is likely to backfire, because they'll think you need to be taught a lesson.

, This doesn’t mean you should start spouting off excuses, but rather give some rationale behind your actions. Instead of letting the teacher or counselor assume you are lazy or simply mischievous, try to offer them a reason they can understand. For example, tell them you were overwhelmed by the course material and simply were terrified of failing. It doesn’t undo the cheating, but everyone can relate to being scared.


Make sure to tell your teacher that you studied for the test. It will look better for you if they know you did try to do well on your own.

"

Evaluate the evidence against you.,
Tell authorities you did not cheat.,
Stick to one story.",How to Deal With the Situation when You Are Caught Cheating in a Test2," If a teacher saw you looking at an answer key in the middle of an exam, you aren’t going to be able to convince anyone that you weren’t cheating. However, if your teacher simply has a hunch that you cheated, you may be able to successfully deny the allegations. The repercussions of cheating can be intense, such as losing financial aid, getting suspended, getting expelled, and more. Unless you were caught red-handed, you may be able to convince your teacher that you’re innocent.


If you aren’t exactly sure what evidence your teacher has against you, plan on denying. If they didn’t catch you in the moment, they may only have a suspicion.

, If you believe you can get away with it, go for it. The most important thing to do is to act surprised that they’re questioning you in the first place. Imagine if you worked hard and completed an exam or a paper without cheating… wouldn’t you be shocked if you were accused of cheating? Channel that reaction.


If your teacher accuses you of plagiarizing, simply tell them that you used the source in question for research. After reading the information and going directly to your paper to write it, you may have unintentionally phrased things similarly.
If your score was uncharacteristically high on a test, just tell your teacher that you studied intently for it, as opposed to other times.
Each accusation will be different, but unless you have a great excuse, keep it simple. Repeat that you studied hard, you did your best, and you’re upset that you’re being blamed.

, Keep it simple. If you are going to deny cheating, you don’t need to come up with a winding, elaborate lie. Continuously repeat that you did not cheat, you are not a cheater, and you are saddened by the accusation. Do not tell different people different stories, and do not confess to a friend or sibling, no matter how trustworthy you think you are. Maintain one solid story, and don’t budge.

Accept the consequences.,
Prepare for a discussion with authorities.,
Get it over with.,
Keep a positive attitude.,
Understand your rights.",How to Deal With the Situation when You Are Caught Cheating in a Test3," Tell your punisher that you understand whatever punishment or consequence they dole out, whether it be a week of detention, a month of detention, or a failing grade. Arguing will probably not make them change their mind about a punishment, but will only make you look worse. By accepting your punishment graciously, they will see that you have learned your lesson and understand the seriousness of your offense.Of course, this doesn’t have to be genuine.


Having the ability to accept consequences can make you a stronger, more courageous person in the long run.

, These can be different groups or people, depending on your situation. Often, schools will have “honor councils” that will determine your punishment, almost like a jury in court. Other times, a dean of discipline, the principal, or your teacher will decide your fate. It’s important to prepare for these discussions. Prepare a great explanation, rather than a whiny excuse. Explain what lead you to cheat, and how you will fix this moving forward. If you have a great academic or behavioral record up until this incident, point that out.


It’s important to show everyone that the cheating was out of character and you are deeply sorry.
Enlist the help of an older sibling or an adult you trust to help plan out your words. You may be required to write a statement. If so, edit, edit, edit. Read it to parents, teachers, and friends to get feedback.

, Whatever your punishment is, just do it and move on. The longer you put it off, the longer it will stress you out.You did the crime, so do the time! If you have to tell your parents about what happened, go straight home and tell them. If you have to write a repentance essay, do it that night. If you have to accept a zero on the test, get to work finding extra credit.


Not only will you be able to put this event behind you sooner, you will also show the authority figure that you are serious about fixing the problem.

, This will make you look better to your teachers, but it will also make the punishment easier. Focus on making the best out of a bad situation, and use your punishment as a learning experience.Don’t mouth off or mope. Instead, keep your head up and deal with the consequences with the cheeriest outlook you can manage.


Cheating on one test won’t ruin your life. While the consequences can be intense, as stated earlier, it doesn’t help to continuously beat yourself up or wallow in misery. Stay optimistic, and don’t dwell on the mistake you made.

, While it’s important to accept reasonable punishment, it’s also OK to fight back if you genuinely believe the punishment does not fit the crime, or if you don’t believe the punishment was determined properly. You have a right to due process from authority, and the teacher cannot dole out punishment without letting you share your side of the story.If you are facing expulsion from school, it is important to understand your rights. Laws about school expulsion vary from state to state, and from public to private schools. You have the right to be represented by a lawyer throughout this process.If you decide to appeal a suspension or expulsion that you believe to be unjust, you can learn more about that here.

Determine the cause of your cheating.,
Create a plan to deal with said issue.,
Commit to your new plan.",How to Deal With the Situation when You Are Caught Cheating in a Test4," This can be tricky, and it might take a little bit of self-reflection. However, it’s extremely important to determine what led you to cheat in the first place.Were you stumped by the subject? Were you too busy with extracurricular activities to study? Did you feel pressured by your parents to get a perfect grade? Be honest with yourself about why you resorted to cheating, whether or not it is a great reason.


You don’t necessarily need to tell anyone what you figure out about yourself, but keep it as useful knowledge going forward.

, If you were confused about the subject matter on the test, make a plan to work with a tutor, study an extra hour after school, or meet with your teacher to ask questions. If you couldn’t find the time to study between your other after school commitments, you need to quit some of your extracurriculars (or rearrange your schedule) in order to make school a priority.


No matter what caused you to cheat, you should be able to make a plan to follow going forward.
While apologizing and accepting your punishment is OK once, making this plan will help it from becoming a routine occurrence.

, This is your chance to prove yourself and show that you are not a cheater. Hold yourself accountable, and remind yourself how unpleasant your punishment was. If you need to study more, turn off your cell phone and really commit to studying for a block of time without distractions. If you need extra help, reach out to your teacher and schedule a time to meet that you can’t flake on.You may need to make sacrifices in order to become a better student, but this will be worth it in order to avoid the temptation to cheat and the punishment that comes along with it.

Do not let cheating become a habit.,
Ask for help if you're struggling.",How to Cheat Using a Cheat Sheet," You will have to bring out a very small version of your cheat sheet for this to work. Type up a cheat sheet on a computer, using the smallest font possible. Most people can't read smaller than an 8 point font. Then, print out the paper and cut out the section that contains the text.Roll the cheat sheet tightly enough that you can slip inside your mechanical pencil.
When you're struggling during the exam, pretend that you need to reload your pencil with lead. Slip out your cheat sheet and quickly take a look.
Be careful. You will have to glance at the sheet quickly. You should also hold your pencil slightly below your desk as you pretend to reload the lead. You do not want your teacher, or anyone else, to see you are using a cheat sheet.;
, You can purchase invisible ink at many department stores, and you can also buy it online. Buy the type of invisible ink that shows up in UV light. You should also buy a keychain flashlight that gives off UV light.Write your cheat sheet down in invisible ink. Bring it to class the day of the exam. Your teacher will probably not worry about a seemingly blank piece of paper out on your desk. Keep your keychain in your hand during the exam, or set it out on your desk. You can pretend you're fiddling with it out of nerves.
When the exam begins, subtly shine your flashlight on the piece of paper when you're stumped. It's a good idea to sit in back, to minimize the risk of getting caught.

, When you write your cheat sheet, set another piece of paper down below it. Press very hard when you write. The words should be lightly imprinted on the blank sheet of paper. Take it to class on the day of your exam and keep it out on your desk. If your teachers asks, tell her it's scrap paper you intend to use for brainstorming.If you're having trouble reading the words, use your pencil to lightly shade the paper. This should make the words more legible.

, Type up your cheat sheet using very small font. Usually, size 8 is the smallest font people can read. Print out the cheat sheet, and cut the section containing text out.Buy a pack of gum. Make sure the kind you purchase contains individually wrapped portions of gum. Remove the foil from one stick of gum.
Take your cheat sheet and wrap it round the stick of gum. Re-wrap the gum in foil.
During the exam, pretend you're getting a stick of gum. Glance at the cheat sheet as you rewrap the gum and find the answer you need.
If you're not allowed to chew gum in class, this method will not work. Check your school's policy before attempting this method.

, For a math class, especially an advanced math course, you're usually allowed a calculator. If you have a graphing calculator, there is usually a function you can use to save notes, graphs, and equations. This can work great on a math exam, as a teacher is unlikely to get suspicious of you using a calculator. He or she will assume you're simply typing in calculations.On a graphing calculator, you can usually press a button that says ""program"" and then press ""new."" You will then be taken to a screen where you type in formulas.
To access this information, press ""Edit."" Scroll down and find the note that you made with the equations and select it.
Every graphing calculator is different. The process on yours may vary. Refer to the instruction's manual for precise directions on adding notes to your calculator.

, An audio cheat sheet can work as well as a pen and paper one. You can make a recording of yourself listing basic information. Then, upload that recording to a portable electronic device, like an iPhone or iPod.If you do not already have one, stop by an electronics store and purchase small wireless headphones. You can synch these with your device and place the headphones in prior to your exam. Your teacher is unlikely to see them.
You can play your recording on a loop. However, some devices come with a small microphone that takes commands. You may be able to make a noise, like a small cough, to signal your recording to play when you get confused.

, This is a simple method, but can be effective. As long as you hold the phone still, and focus, a cheat sheet should be legible on a phone camera. You will probably have to zoom in to read some of the information, but this can be a simple way to sneak your cheat sheet into your exam.Keep in mind, teachers usually do not allow phones out during an exam. A teacher will likely get very suspicious if he or she sees you using your phone.
Therefore, sit in the back of class. Be very careful when checking your phone. You can pretend you're getting something from a purse or backpack and glance at your phone. You can also keep your phone under your desk, and subtly glance at it when necessary.

, Some iPods allow you to upload notes. You can type your cheat sheet into your iPod and look at the notes when necessary during the exam. A teacher may be less suspicious of an iPod than a smart phone, as a teacher may not think an iPod does anything other than play music.You may be able to keep your iPod on your desk during the exam. You can walk into the exam listening to headphones and then casually set your iPod down on your desk.
In the event your teacher asks you to move your iPod, keep it under your desk or balance it on your knee. Quickly glance down at your iPod when necessary during the exam.
Sit in the back of the room to avoid being caught checking your iPod.

, Every school has a different policy regarding cheating. You want to make sure cheating is worth the risk for you before attempting to do so. Read up on the penalties for cheating in your school's handbook.Some schools may give you a failing grade if you get caught cheating. This can affect your report card grade at the end of the term.
You may also be sent to the principal's office. Your parents may be called, leading to trouble at home.
If you're in college, you may receive a failing grade for the semester in the event you cheat.

, Everyone slips up once in awhile, but cheating can be a real problem if it's habitual. The more often you cheat, the more likely you are to get caught. Cheating can also prevent you from learning valuable information.It's a bad idea to cheat at all. However, if you feel the need to do so, try not to cheat on every test or exam.
Avoid cheating unless there were specific, extenuating circumstances that prevented you from studying.

, There is no shame in asking for help. If you're cheating because you don't understand a subject, reach out to someone for guidance.You can start seeing a tutor. If your school offers free tutoring programs, make use of those.
You can also ask your teacher for help. Most teachers do not want to see their students struggle.
Tell your parents and friends if you're struggling with a class. They can help support you as you try to improve your performance.

Whether you're working on a worksheet with short answers, multiple choice answers, or working the same math problems, the best way to get the correct answers is to find someone who did them right and get the answers safely.


First, you've got to make friends with the smartest kids in class, who always do the work correctly. It helps if you can share in the workload sometimes, alternating who does the homework and who copies, night to night. Don't be totally useless.
The best times to copy homework are on the bus on the way home, or on the way to school. It's usually better to do it on the way home, so you can still try to actually do the homework if you need to. Never copy homework in class before class starts. Never talk about copying the answers in public, to your parents, or to other students. Keep it quiet.;
, Doing an assignment in a big group in which everyone contributes is a good way to make sure that everyone gets the right answers and the assignment gets done quickly. Do it in the safety of someone's home, or on the bus after school to stay safe. Never try to do this in class.


To make the homework go faster, split up all the answers among the group. Have one person do the first five, another do the next five, and so on. You should be able to finish before the bus ride is over. Try to keep the group as small as possible.
Don't make the group too big. If everyone names the first president of the United States as ""George Washington Carver"" on the homework, your teacher might be suspicious that something strange was happening. After you copy it, go back over it once by yourself to fix any obvious mistakes and make little changes to make it your own.

, Whenever you copy answers from someone, whatever the assignment, change the wording of some of the answers, or change some of your answers slightly to avoid suspicion. You never want your answers to be completely identical to your best friend's.


Even just fixing the order of words in short answers can throw a teacher off the scent, if the answer is correct. Change ""John Glenn was the first American in space"" to ""The first American in space was John Glenn.""
To stay extra covert, try to copy off of someone that your teacher doesn't think you're friends with. The teacher may be more likely to look more closely at the homework for signs of cheating if you're neighbors with someone, or if you're sitting next to someone.

, Sometimes if a certain homework assignment has been used for enough semesters for a while, the solution may be floating around on the internet., If you're not a great student, it can seem kind of conspicuous if suddenly you turn in homework with all correct answers. If you're going to cheat, be smart about it, and get a few of them wrong. This will lower the suspicions of your teacher, making it more likely that you'll get away with it. Pick enough that you'll still get a good grade, but let some be wrong. If you've got a B+ without doing any real work, it's worth it.

, If your teacher catches you copying answers from a friend, you'll likely both fail the homework, might even fail the class, and might face stronger punishments. Is skipping a couple math problems worth a possible suspension? And think about your friend who did the homework correctly, was a good student, and will face the same punishment as you. Bad news. It's probably better to just do the work, and it'll take just as long as figuring out where to get the answers, finding the answers, copying the answers, and obscuring your answers.

, Many schools offer after-school homework help that will make the homework easier, by providing someone to help you figure it out, but without the possibility of getting into trouble over it. If you've been in trouble for cheating in the past, this can also be a great way of showing your teachers that you're turning over a new leaf.


Online tutoring even exists in some places. Some college students will sometimes answer homework questions or offer assistance online, sometimes for a price.If you can send copies of the questions, you might at least get some help figuring out the answer for yourself.

Bring a draft of the test with you to class.,
Make sure to write down the numbers of the questions you don't know.

,
Your classmate will write down the answers and return the test draft (when the teacher isn't looking).",How to Cheat on a Test Using School Supplies1," Obviously this option is only available if the teacher allows students to use a draft. Arrange beforehand to have a classmate ask for the draft.;
,,


This method works best for math and science tests.

Skip everything but the first and last sentence of each paragraph.,
Skip to the chapter summary in the textbook.,
Read the Cliff’s Notes of a novel or story instead.,
Break up the reading with friends.,
Watch the movie.,
Find at least one thing to say in class.",How to Cheat on Homework2," If you've got to read the textbook or a novel really fast for class, you need to be smart about it and get through it as much as possible. One of the fastest ways to get a sense of the major concepts and the scope of the book without really reading it is to read the first and last sentence of each paragraph. You'll miss a lot, yes, but you'll at least have flown over the mountains and seen them from above.


Skip everything but the vocab words in a textbook. The skipping-around method tends to work better with textbooks, in which the actual explanations aren't that important, but the names and the vocab words are. You can read the textbook very fast this way, and not miss much information.
Alternatively, depending on the kind of class, it might be better to read the first and last chapter of a novel, or focus all your attention on a single small part of the book and bring it up in class, to look as if you've read the whole thing and are prepared for discussion.

, Instead of struggling through reading a whole chapter in the textbook, skip to the end. Most chapters usually have short summaries of the chapter at the end, so you can know exactly what it is you should have learned by reading the chapter, without actually having to read the chapter. You will also usually get a list of the vocabulary words, some sample test questions, and other good information. It's not even really cheating, just smart reading.

, The classic friend of the lazy reader: Cliff's Notes, Spark Notes, or other shortened summaries of long classics, available at most bookstores and libraries. Even if you do plan on reading the book, these are excellent study guides, giving you great questions to ask and symbols to notice in complicated books. These will help to point you in the right direction.


It's also easy to find a long plot synopsis online, so you can at least get a good list of the characters and the style of the novel.

, Forgot to read Great Gatsby over the summer and have to catch up on the last day before school starts? You're probably not alone. Get together with a group and break up the reading into sections, so you can all compare notes. Stagger the reading, so one person will read the first 50 pages, then the next person will take over and summarize the rest of the book. Who knows, if you get invested in it enough, you might just want to read it anyway.


Ask your friends to summarize their 50 assigned pages (or however many it works out to be) and take good notes on the section, then copy out the notes for everyone in the group. After that, each person's work will be done. It's like reading a whole book by only reading 1/3 or a 1/2.

, Check to see if a good movie has been made based on the book that you're reading for class. If there is one, check it out, pop some popcorn, and watch a flick instead of reading the book. Take good notes, just as you would if you were doing homework, but it'll only take you an hour-and-a-half to ""read"" the whole thing.


It's still a good idea to do some research and figure out whether or not the movie is accurate. Lots of movies take serious liberties with the plot lines of books, and you'll likely miss the names of characters and other minor plot points that might get cut out of the movie but be important for the book.
Good movies based on books commonly assigned for school include: Grapes of Wrath, Romeo & Juliet, Lord of the Flies,'Pride & Prejudice, Wuthering Heights, Of Mice and Men, and To Kill a Mockingbird.

Bad movies to watch instead of reading the book include The Iliad ('don't watch 'Troy, starring Brad Pitt), Fahrenheit 451, Catcher in the Rye, Beowulf, Romeo & Juliet, and The Great Gatsby. These are good ways to prove you haven't read the book.


, If you're struggling with having half-read an assignment and are worried about being exposed, try this time-worn trick: scan through the book quickly, just before class, and focus on one extremely small thing from the reading. It should be preferably deep in the reading, many pages beyond what you've actually read. Early in the class discussion, raise your hand and ask a question, pointing specifically to the page. Everyone will think you've read it, and then you can chill out and stop participating.


It's also a good idea to look for possible talking-points online before you even do the reading, so you can know what to look for and have a good idea of something to say in class. Participation points with no actual work.

Make friends with an older student or sibling with old essays.,
”Translate” the sentences into your own words.,
Make sure you understand the topic thoroughly.,
Make sure to follow the instructions of the assignment.,
Understand the consequences of plagiarism.",How to Cheat on Homework3," Papers and essays are like the Mount Everest for cheaters. Climbing it is difficult, dangerous, and tempting. If you want to get away with cheating on an essay, the best way to cut corners is to find an older sibling or older neighbor who hung on to their copies of the same assignment from years past.


Many older teachers will assign the same papers year after year, and won't keep copies of them, making it very difficult for them to remember one students paper after a year or two. Never do this if your teacher collects essays online, or saves digital copies. This makes it very easy to do a quick file search and find copied passages.
Buying essays online is basically a scam for chumps, so don't get schemed out of your hard-earned lunch money by some enterprising con artist. If you don't know the person you're getting the essay from, write it yourself. In general, paying to cheat is a bad idea, friend, sibling, or otherwise.

, When you get a copy of the old essay, you do have to do at least a little bit of work to change things up and make it your own. The best way to do this is to retype the essay, changing each sentence as you go. You can retain the good ideas and the order of most things, and also change up the exact wording to make it slightly different.


Make sure the response to the topic is still up-to-date and not incriminating. If you see opportunities to expand and make more current references, do it to bring everything together.
Never copy-paste from online and turn it in without revising. If you do, go over the font and the size to make sure everything is uniform.
Copying passages or whole chunks of text from online is always easy to find quickly. If you try this, you risk lots of trouble.

, After going through the essay, read it alone to make sure that you're really understand what it's saying and that everything makes sense. If you turn in a paper and you're unfamiliar with the topic, it might become obvious if your teacher wants to talk to you about it or ask you specific questions about what you meant. Don't get caught by being careless.

, If you try to get fancy and patch together an essay from multiple sources, it might seem great to have a bunch of expert level discussions about gun control, but you still might end up with a terrible grade if you haven't provided a possible solution, like the assignment required.


Read the assignment sheet closely as you go over the copied essay, making sure that it does everything that it needs to for you to get a good grade. If it doesn't, you need to add that in. Hey, at least you didn't have to start from scratch.

, Stealing material from someone is against the rules at every school, and can get you into serious trouble–we're talking automatic failure of most classes, most subjects, and possible expulsion from school. It's probably better to just write the thing.

A small wood-etching tool may also be used if you happen to have one handy. Make sure the tip of the tool is fine enough for small print., Similar to taping information to the pencil itself, notes can be written on a small strip of paper and placed along the inside of a mechanical pencil. An advantage to layering the strip along the inside of the mechanical pencil is the natural camouflage the mechanical pencil provides. Note that this will only work with translucent mechanical pencils.


Keep a few “spare” mechanical pencils on your desk to increase the number of notes you have available.

Hide multiple notes inside a mechanical pencil.,
Hide notes in a pen cap.,
Keep notes in a pencil case.,
Hide notes in the eraser wrapping.",How to Cheat on a Test Using Pens or Pencils2," Write down several notes on tiny sheets of paper and roll them into tiny tubes. During the course of the test, remove the eraser from the pencil and retrieve your notes. It may help to bring additional lead to give the illusion that you are replacing the lead in your pencil. Make sure to dispose of the notes in your pocket or in the trash so that no evidence is left behind.

, Write notes on a small strip of paper similar as you would when trying to hide them inside of a mechanical pencil. Roll the paper up and place it loosely in the cap of the pen. During the course of the test, remove the cap as though you are deep in thought and retrieve your notes.


If you pack the notes too tightly into the cap, you’ll have greater trouble retrieving them, which can draw attention to your cheating ways!
Place the note and cap on the butt end of the pen to allow more room for the paper.
Using multiple pens will give you space for more notes.

, Write out any notes or answers to questions ahead of time on small pieces of paper. Place the paper in your pencil case (or other similar cases, such as an eyeglass case). You can retrieve the notes by pretending you need to grab an additional pencil or eraser from your pencil case during the test..


Clear, soft plastic pencil cases, such as those that are zipped closed, allow you to see your notes without needing to open the pencil case. Place the pencil case somewhere on the floor where you can see it easily.

, If you have an eraser that features paper sleeves, remove the sleeve and write your notes on the inside. During the test, remove the sleeve as though you need to use a larger portion of the eraser, and carefully arrange the sleeve so that the answers are visible.Light colored erasers can be written on directly, either with ink or lead. This is a great place to write down simple short answers or facts, as the answers can later be rubbed off.
The eraser sleeve may need to be disassembled to allow easy writing. If this is the case, you can adhere it back on the eraser with a small amount of tape or glue.

Write your cheat notes in white colored pencil.,
Use erasable ink.,
Insert a black ink stem into a red pen.",How to Cheat on a Test Using Pens or Pencils3," Many tests allow the use of a blank sheet of paper for working out equations. If you are allowed to use note paper during your test, write down your cheat notes on the piece of paper you plan to use as scrap with a white-colored pencil. White colored pencil will be nearly impossible to detect from a distance, but should be easily visible to your own eyes, provided you have enough light.


White ink can also work for creating these “invisible” notes, but may be slightly more visible to others due to ink’s reflective properties.White Out is fairly visible as far as this technique concerned, and can blot out the natural lines in the paper. Use at your own risk!

, If your tests are self-marked in class, invest in a pen with erasable ink. When it comes time to take the test, use that pen to mark all the answers. Then, when you self-check the answers, discretely erase any answers that are wrong and replace them with the correct answers.


When taking the test, make sure to write lightly with the pen. If you press too hard, your old answers will be visible as indentations in the paper, giving away your actions!

, Some classes will require you to make edits to your test using a red pen to denote wrong answers. Replace the red ink in the pen with black ink and make the corrected changes in secret. Keep an actual red pen nearby in case your teacher is observing the changes you make.


This trick works best when corrections are made through additions to the existing work (such as with missing grammatical marks from papers). Try suggesting to your teacher that self-correction leads to better learning!Using erasable ink can help make extra space on the paper if you need to insert a word or number in order to make the answer correct.

Make sure your test passes the eye test.,
Smear Chapstick on the answers you've marked.,
Smear the mark.,
Draw lines in the answer bubbles.",How to Cheat on a Scantron Test1," If any of the following methods actually work, but you've marked every answer ""B,"" the test administrator or teacher is still going to throw out your test. Every Scantron test is examined by a person and run through the testing machine. To do this correctly, you need to both pass the eye test, making your test look as authentic as possible, and fool the machine into failing to mark wrong answers.


Avoid obviously-dumb cheating pitfalls, like only marking one column of answers or making your blurry answer bubbles super-obvious and on every question. If you try to do this on every question, you're going to fail, no question about it.
If the worst you can do is guess on every answer, guess randomly. Make your test look as if you've given it an honest effort.;
, Theoretically, greasing your answers with Chapstick will confuse the machine and cause it to fail marking anything on the test form. Reportedly, this works up to 25% of the time, though some test administrators report that it's an unsuccessful method of fooling the machine.Use only the lightest dab of Chapstick, and only on the answers you think are wrong. If you turn in a form smeared within an inch of its life with grease, you're going to get in trouble.
Some cheaters think that this is a dated method, once successful but more recently eradicated by more sophisticated machines. In fact, it might cause questions answered correctly to be marked as incorrect., Some cheaters think blurring the pencil mark somewhere between fully-marked and blank will confuse the machine. To try this, draw a small dot in the middle of an answer, and then shade lightly around in the other answer bubbles. Smear everything with your fingers.


The idea is to shade the circle dark enough the teacher will not question it, but light enough that the machine will be confused. Supposedly, this can work around 20% of the time, though you've still got to make it look authentic., Some cheaters think that, rather than filling in the answer bubbles fully, lines will confuse the machine, causing it to fail to register incorrect answers. Horizontal or diagonal lines might confuse the sensor, causing it to fail in scanning correctly.


This is perhaps the most unreliable method of all. On almost every Scantron instruction sheet, there's an obvious step instruction you explicitly to fill in the answers ""full and dark."" Teachers and state graders still look at the forms and will toss out forms filled out incorrectly completed. If you do this, you risk a complete failure and disciplinary action.


"
"
Color the black lines to the left of the answer bubbles.,
Erase the lines.,
Cut out the big black square.,
Mark your test as the answer key.",How to Cheat on a Scantron Test2," Some cheaters think the black lines that line the test are used to communicate data to the testing scanner, and since you're instructed to avoid making marks in the area, it's possible that coloring in the black spaces can cause the test to fail.


Supposedly, this is thought by some to be the most reliable method, yielding a successful machine fail up to 30% of the time.
Again, marking anywhere other than the answer bubbles is against the rules of the Scantron test, so you need to use light marks and not make them obvious.

, For the same reason that marking in the black area can cause the machine to fail, some think that erasing the lines can cause the same effect. On answers you don't know, make your best guess and then try erasing the black marks to the left of the row.


Of course, the problem with erasing these marks is that they'll probably fail the eye test. These rows will stick out like a sore thumb at a quick glance, possibly causing your test to be chucked. If you do this, only do it on some of the answers.

, On many pages of the Scantron test is a big page you're not supposed to mark. Supposedly, finding a way to cut it out on the sly yields a high success rate of making the machine fail. The problem is that it's super-obvious, both in the testing center and at a quick glance. Still, if you want to roll the dice, you can give it a shot.

, Though somewhat uncommon, some Scantron forms have a space where you can mark that the form you're filling out is either a test or the answer key. If your teacher made an epic mistake of using one of these forms, exploit it and mark yours as the key. It'll reset the machine and your answers will be correct. Your classmates won't be so lucky.

Copy possible answers onto the label of a water bottle.,
Input answers into your graphing calculator.,
Study.",How to Cheat on a Scantron Test3," Statistically, you'll stand a better chance of getting a good score on a Scantron test if you just read the answers, eliminate obviously-wrong answers, and make a halfway decent guess. Using good test habits is the best cheat of all. You don't have to be a genius to pass the test.— You just have to recognize the wrong answers and make a good guess.


If you're going to be stuck in the testing center all day any way, you might as well take the time to actually do it. It's not like you can leave. Read the answers closely and make a guess. At least you'll have tried.

, If you're allowed to have water during the test, try to write down some helpful information that you might be tested over on the back of the label to have during the test. This is only effective for class tests, not state-wide exams, which are impossible to guess what you'll be tested over.


Remove the label carefully, taking precautions not to tear it. Write vocab words or formulas that you'll need for the test on the back of the label and replace it. Use tape to stick it back on.

, If you've got a Scantron mid-term coming up in physics or mathematics, keeping formulas on a graphing calculator that you use can be a good way to keep helpful information close at hand.


Teachers are typically on the look out for this cheat, and will often make students remove the batteries from the calculator.

, Yeah, yeah, bummer-alert. This isn't a cheat at all, but the best way to pass a test is to know the correct answers. Don't spend time poking around the Internet for ways to cheat the test. Take the time to study instead. That time will be much better spent.

""Text a Tutor"" has an app that you can download to your Android phone. For iPhone and other smartphone users, you can still use the service even without an app.

, The app takes a picture of the equation and solves it immediately. This app is especially good if your test requires you to show the steps in solving a question, as you have the option to see the different steps (rather than just the answer).
This app isn't just for cheating; it's also good for studying. You can use it as a learning tool and understand how to solve math problems step-by-step.

, You could use a general search engine like Google or, better yet, type the question in WolframAplha.com. Wolfram Alpha is a computational knowledge engine; in other words, the site answers questions using data it has already sourced. Unlike a standard search engine, then, this site provides you with an answer, rather than a list of web pages that could have the answer.Keep in mind that using a cell phone is a very obvious way of cheating. There is an increased likelihood that you will be caught, as teachers and instructors are on the lookout for cell phones during the test. In many testing situations, you are required to put your phone away in your backpack or at the front of the room, meaning that this method won't work at all for you.

Whisper or pass notes.,
Use the tapping method.,
Engage in misdirection.",How to Cheat On a Math Test2," Engaging in contact with a friend during the test is definitely a potential way to cheat, but it's a high risk method. In most testing situations, whispering, talking, and passing notes between test-takers is not permitted. It's also pretty easy to catch from a distance.

, This method is an updated version of Morse code, which involves communicating with another person with predetermined signals. Find a friend in your class who be a good partner for this. This should ideally be someone who isn't very far from you (ideally next to you) and someone who knows the subject well.
Develop a tapping code. For example, tap 5 times for number 5. If it's a number like 2647, tap your pencil on the desk 2 times, pause for about 3 seconds, and then tap it 6 times and so on. If it's a multiple choice test using the alphabet, try coding A, B, C, D, E, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively.
You could also try different versions of this method that operate on the same principle. Instead of tapping, cough or sneeze to communicate an answer. You could also use sign language - especially fingers for methods - to communicate with a friend., Have a friend create a distraction while you cheat (or vice versa). Your friend, for example, might pretend to feel sick so that the instructor's attention is diverted away from you and other students and placed solely onto him or her. This will give you a bit of time to consult notes or other aids you've prepared to help you cheat.

Decide which type of cheating is going to be most beneficial for you — the Cheat-Sheet, the Partner-Cheating, or the Hard-to-Prove.,
Don't get caught.",How to Cheat On a Test1," (Refer to the sections below for more information on such methods.)

, Cheating only helps if you can get away with it. Here are some simple tips to avoid getting caught:


Don't look suspicious. It's important to strike a balance between effectively getting your answers and not making it obvious. To do this, don't overly fidget. If you must look around, never hold your gaze in one place for longer than five to ten seconds. Switch it up by randomly staring in other directions — this way, your test supervisors won't get too suspicious and find out where your accomplice (or cheat sheet) is.
Don't aim too high. It's not impossible to cheat your way into a perfect score if you really put in the effort, but if everyone else is getting an unremarkable grade on the exam, you will draw attention to yourself. This is fine if you normally get decent marks, but if you're known among teachers as one of the slower students, then there's a chance that they'll find out. Deliberately miss a few questions, though, and you'll be good to go. Try getting a B on a test and continually but slowly raising your average score until it's an A. You can even shoot for ups and downs in your scores, to make it appear more natural.
Dispose of the evidence. As soon as the test is over ask to go to the bathroom (if you haven't already gone) to wash off or throw away any evidence of cheating. The longer you hold on to something, then the better your chance of getting caught because one person or another will notice.

Instead of writing out entire words or sentences, just use one letter (preferably a starting letter) to remind you what the full answer is, and just spread them out across your desk, instead of writing them all in one clumped area.
Another good place to write is in the small indent where you can put a pencil at the edge of your desk. This is both difficult to see that spot while walking by, and you can place a pencil over your cheats without suspicion.

, (This works extremely well with light colored desks and pencil; use of pen isn't recommended.)

Start by gathering the information you will need.,
Write or print the information correctly.,
Copy it down.,
Hide the sheet.",How to Cheat On a Test2," This includes formulas, key words, vocabulary, dates, definitions, names, conjugations, etc.;
, The font should always be clear to read, and in the Goldie Locks size (not too big, not too small). While you would want to include as much as possible on the small sheet of paper, remember if the font is too small you will overly focus on your cheat-sheet thereby increasing your chances of getting caught. Also if it is possible to print-out your cheat sheet, do that. It will reduce the chances of your teacher or professor being able to trace it back to you.

, This is most common for spelling tests. Copy down the spellings in your spelling book to a piece of paper, then put it on your lap or up your sleeve. This is a high risk method, so be careful.

,



Try the ""Body Part Cheat-Sheet"" method. Instead of printing out the cheat sheet, try writing it on a part of your body. Good places include your forearm if you are a man or your upper thigh if you are a woman. These are both great because you can wear a dress or long sleeve shirt to cover up your cheat sheet when you aren't using it. It's important to not make it obvious that there is writing on your body. Put the words in a place that faces you only.

Try the ""Water Bottle Cheat-Sheet"" method. Print out the cheat sheet on a colored piece of paper that matches that label of your water bottle. Paste it on the label and turn it so that it only faces you. Ideally, you want to mimic the writing on the label to avoid suspicion.

Try the ""Binder Cheat-Sheet"" method. If you have a binder that has a clear slot in the front, slide your cheat sheet into there. Move your binder from under your desk to the slide of your desk to peek at your cheat sheet. Try to minimize the amount of slide, especially if you don't have carpet in your classroom.

Try the ""Calculator Cheat-Sheet"" method. This is common for people who are taking math tests, because that's the only reasonable time to have a calculator without being suspicious. Slide formulas or information terms between the back of the calculator and the calculator's cover.

Another Calculator Method to try: If you have a graphing calculator, save the math formulas into your calculator. Then, put the information into archive, so you will still be able to get to it if your teacher makes you clear the RAM. Unarchive the information during the test. Clear the memory after the test. This also works if it's the school's calculator, because no teacher or student is going to look in the archive. If you don't know how to archive things on a calculator, look it up.

Try the ""Stashed Cheat-Sheet"" method. Hide a cheat-sheet in a separate place all together to avoid it getting connected back to you. This includes on a bulletin board in the classroom, in a bathroom stall or on someone's chair.

Wear a long sleeved shirt and hide your cheat sheets under the sleeves. It is a very good method, because your teacher won't look under your sleeves. And when your teacher isn't looking, you can easily take out a cheat sheet, and it's easy to put it back.

"
"
Try the ""Peeking-Partner"" method.,
Try the ""Signing-Partner"" method.",How to Cheat On a Test3," Seat yourself behind someone who will do well on the test (either bragged about studying or is a master in the subject). Adjust yourself so that you are on the furthest left or right on your seat facing diagonally towards his or her desk, this should allow you to look over their shoulder without having to move your head too much. Never choose a student in the center of the classroom or in the front as this makes it more likely that your teacher will notice you looking over their shoulder.

, Create a system of signing with a fellow student in the class. This is going to double your knowledge of the subject because you can work together to sign answers to each other. On multiple choice exams:


Establish hand or foot tapping signals for A, B, C, D, E and ""wrong answer."" By creating a signal for ""wrong answer"" you are going to improve the likelihood of you both doing well on the test by helping each other eliminate wrong answers. Also create a vocal noise for getting their attention that isn't suspicious (like a cough, or foot tap).
Start by coughing to get their attention.
Use your fingers to give the number of the question (flash 3 than a 2 to with your hand signal question ""32"").
Wait for them to signal their answer (pulling their ear for ""B"").
If you need help deciding between 2 answers: cough, give the question number, and signal for the answer you suspect it might be.
He or she can nod his or her head if its correct, if it's the wrong answer he or she can send the ""wrong answer"" signal (put up your hair in a ponytail).

"
Try getting the ""Instructor's Edition"" version of your Textbook.,
Try getting an ""Advanced/Old Copy"" of the test.,
Try the ""Comeback Later"" method.,
Try the ""Bring Your Pencil"" method.,
Try the ""Fake Exam Paper"" method.",How to Cheat On a Test4," For professors who use pre-made quizzes from their ""instructor's edition"" textbooks, purchase a copy. Find the correct edition of the book online and buy it. Before a quiz memorize the answers to the questions. This method is good for entry level science, foreign language and/or history classes that pull their quizzes straight from the book.

, This can be done by talking to an old student or by talking to other students who might have connections in the class. Study straight from the exam, or if you suspect that the exam will be the same, study the answers straight.

, If you know a professor or teacher will let you come back to finish a test, purposefully don't finish the exam and ask to comeback on a later date. Make sure to memorize the topics or questions so that you can look up the answers before finishing the test later.


Claim to be sick, go to the bathroom towards the end of the exam until its over, or pace yourself slowly. Be sure that your professor will let you come back before using this method as you could actually do worse if he/she doesn't let you finish.

, As you turn in your exam, if your professor isn't at her/his desk, use a pencil you brought up with you to change or write in answers from the test at the top of the pile. (This is a high risk!)

, Knowing the exact format of the exam paper will help for this, so you can write down all important points on a paper which looks exactly like the the exam paper.

If your exam paper is a question/answer type then remember to add one important point as the question and the other as the answer. You also have to include the page number and marks per question (if included).
The next thing to do is staple this piece of paper with the original question paper during the test without anyone noticing.

"
"
Try cramming information last minute.,
For the next test, start studying earlier and more effectively.",How to Cheat On a Test5," By spending the few minutes before an exam skimming over your notes or studying, you have a shot at being able to do well without cheating.



For essays, try to remember key words and points. Usually professors or teachers look for key words or important points; the essay's formal ""fluff"" is less important. If you know the topic or possible topics of an essay question, cram four to five terms or important points you know your professor will be looking for instead of studying everything, thereby reducing the effort required.

For math exams, try to memorize formulas. Knowing a formula can be more powerful that spending hours doing practice problems. If you can write down a formula enough to memorize it, then you can spend the test trying to apply those to the problems.

For multiple choice exams, try ""chunking"" information you know will be on the test. Instead of memorizing a list of words, try breaking it into easier to remember smaller lists. For example, if studying for a history test, instead of remembering ""Jefferson, Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Grant, Lincoln, and Lee"" break it up into the ""4 of the founding fathers: Franklin, Washington, Jefferson and Hamilton"" and the ""3 civil war leaders: Lee, Lincoln, Grant."" By memorizing the number of men to a specific topic, it'll be easier to narrow down who you are missing.

, Taking into consideration your current timetable, you can try to create your own study schedule."

Pay closer attention in class.,
Develop better study habits.,
Get help from a tutor.,
Use your bad grades as motivation.,
Do your best.",How to Change a Bad Report Card1," The best way to change your grades, of course, is to do it the right way. Show up to class every day and make an effort to be actively engaged in your lessons. Take notes that you can review later to better familiarize yourself with the material. With time, you’ll find that your understanding of the subject is steadily improving.Listen intently with the purpose of absorbing what’s being explained to you. Ask questions to clarify information that you don’t fully understand.Classroom time is not for sleeping, goofing off or socializing with your friends. Doing these things might explain why you got a bad report card in the first place.;
, Instead of playing video games or hanging out at the mall after school, take an additional hour or two in the afternoon or evening to focus on your studies. Concentrate on the subjects you tend to have the hardest time with. Studying is like practicing for a sport —the more you do, the better you’ll get.There’s no need to deny yourself a life. Just do a little bit more than you’re currently doing.
Make homework more fun by organizing a study group consisting of your closest friends so you can work on difficult assignments together., If you just can’t wrap your head around a certain subject, try working with a tutor. This will give you an opportunity to sit down with someone who can give you the one-on-one attention that you need. Tutors are usually teachers or students themselves, and they can often break things down for you in a way that makes them more comprehensible.Tutors can be hired independently, and are also usually available for instruction through public and private schools.
Tutoring is useful when you find yourself stuck on a certain lesson, or you’re preparing for a big test.

, Getting a bad grade every once in a while isn’t the end of the world. What’s more important is that you learn from your mistakes so you can do better in the future. Rather than becoming discouraged, think of unsatisfactory grades as feedback that can help point in you in the right direction. Developing the determination to overcome challenges is an important part of growing as a student and a person.A slip in your grades doesn't mean that you're unintelligent or lazy. Try to accept the situation as a minor setback and keep moving forward.
Bad grades can happen for many different reasons—perhaps you don't contribute enough to group projects, or you get exceptionally nervous before tests. Tracing a disappointing grade back to its source can allow you to outline clear goals on what to work on and improve., Remember: cheaters never win. Whatever your motivations are for changing a report card, you should never become reliant on underhanded methods to succeed. If you’re determined to work hard and stay focused, nothing can hold you back. You’ll receive a lot more satisfaction knowing that you can do anything if you set your mind to it, which is one of the greatest lessons you can learn during your time in school.Improving your grades through diligent study may take longer, but it will be worth it in the long run.
When you cheat, you’re doing yourself a disservice. You’ll never know what you can accomplish until you do it on your own.

Decide which grades you want to change.,
Conceal the original grades using correction fluid.,
Make a copy of the report card.,
Write in the new grades.",How to Change a Bad Report Card2," Unless you’re normally an exceptional student, it’s unrealistic to have a report card that’s all As. To make your mock-up more believable, only change one or two of the worst grades, rather than every single one. A wider range of grades will attract less attention.


Consider leaving one or two average grades in place. This will make it appear that nothing is amiss.
Write down your real grades on a separate sheet of paper so you can enter a few of them back in later. This will make the end result more convincing.

, Carefully brush over the all the existing grade letters until they’re completely hidden. Take your time and get it right. Be sure not to accidentally erase any other portion of the report card, like part of a bracket or border. Do this for every grade on the report card.Brush on the correction fluid in smooth, even strokes. Thick, uneven or oddly shaped blobs can show up in the photocopy if you’re not careful.
This method will only work if the original report card is printed on white paper. If the paper is colored, the smear from the correction fluid will be too obvious.

, Once the correction fluid is dry, run the report card through a photocopy machine. The printed copy will blur the appearance of the correction fluid, causing it to blend in with the white of the page. You’ll then have a column of perfect blank spots to enter your new and improved grades.Smooth out the original report card to eliminate any creases that may show up in the photocopies.
Run off multiple copies in case you make a mistake while filling one out.

, Go down the columns, plugging in the original grades where you want to keep them and entering new grades in places where you want to change them. You can use this technique whether the original grades were typed or handwritten. As long as you blank out and rewrite all of the grades, no one but your teacher will ever know the difference.


Try to disguise your handwriting so that it isn’t obvious that you filled in the report card yourself, or have a friend draw the new grades for you.Use the same color ink that your teacher ordinarily uses.
If it's apparent that the grades are supposed to be typed, make a second copy of the original report card. Use this copy to cut and paste the good grade letters from the original onto the duplicate, then photocopy the duplicate one last time to make the corrections seamless.

"
"
Scan your report card onto the computer.,
Open the scanned image file in a photo editor program.,
Adjust your grades using the photo editor’s tools.,
Print out the new report card.",How to Change a Bad Report Card3," Place your report card into the scanner, making sure it’s wrinkle-free and lined up precisely. Once it uploads the report card, the scanner will convert the data into an image file. You’ll be editing this image to make whatever changes you think are necessary.If possible, use a scanner somewhere other than home or school, like a friend’s house or public library, to avoid getting caught.
Delete the image file when you’re done so that no record of your caper is left behind.

, More powerful programs like Photoshop, Affinity or Acorn will be your best bet, as they’ll give you the greatest number of tools and options to work with. Load the scanned image into the editor window. Make a note of which grades you want to revise.If you don’t have access to a more sophisticated photo editor, you can use programs like Microsoft Paint or Pixlr, which is a free online editor similar to Photoshop.Be sure to load, edit and save the image in as high a resolution as possible. The better the quality, the less noticeable your corrections will be.

, Use the eraser tool to wipe out the original grade. Then, click on the text function and enter the new grade, making sure it’s centered in the slot. Match the font of the new grade as closely as you can with the original, or copy and paste a good grade over the bad one.Most computers use Times New Roman or Arial as their default fonts. Start with these when trying to make your new grades fit.For an especially convincing forgery, use the Eyedropper tool to match the colors of the original text and background exactly., When you’re happy with the way the new report card looks, run off a copy and examine it closely. Check for places where the text looks poorly centered or out of place. If you do it right, your new, glowing report card should be indistinguishable from the bad one.


Make sure the new report card is formatted correctly before you print it.
Save the original scanned image file and try again as many times as you need to get it just right.

Always have a backup plan!,
Write the answers you need on a small piece of paper and wrap it in transparent scotch tape to make it tear-proof.,
Hide the papers in the following places:


Your pockets (always the shirt, never pockets on the pants!),
Stick it on the underside of your shirt near the edge (make sure it doesn't end up upside down!),
Slide one under your test paper (make sure the professor doesn't see it when he/she collects the tests, remove it beforehand.),
Put one on the chair or on the skirt between your legs and peek when you have the chance.

,
Do the taping-paper-to-places part at home, put them in your pockets, bag and pencil case before entering the classroom, and under the test and between your legs when the professor goes to the other side of the classroom.

",How to Be Safe and Effective when Cheating on a Test," This means, don't write your answers on one big piece of paper, put it in your bag and hope to get through with it. It won't work, not ever. Do the following:;
, Writing in ink is preferable, pencil might get smudged and will be hard to see, especially if drawings and/or mechanical schemes are in question. Do the same thing with six more pieces of paper.

,
Your bag (make it close to you if possible, so you can use it.)
Your pencil case (hide it with pens, erasers, etc. or stick it on the inner side.)
In your sleeves (long, wide sleeves are the best, as they allow you to quickly push the paper back in when the professor comes near you, just make sure you keep your arms on the desk so they don't fall out.)

Switch your seat.,
Model after a quiet kid.,
Think before you speak.,
Write it down.,
Put your phone away.,
Avoid responding to classmates.,
Ask your friends to help.,
Consult your teacher.,
Use a visual aid.,
Don't get discouraged.,
Reward yourself.",How to Avoid Talking in Class," If your teacher allows you to pick your own seats, choose to sit next to a student you don’t know. Sitting next to a buddy of yours makes it extremely difficult to focus on staying quiet. It’s also helpful to pick a seat closer to the front of the classroom. Close proximity to the teacher will make it harder for you to chit chat as the teacher will likely remind you to quiet down.


It’s also a good idea to look for a student who you know is very quiet, and sit next to them. Chances are they won't try to start conversation in the middle of class like your best friend might.;
, Pay attention to your peers, you'll probably notice at least one student who is reserved and rarely talks during class. Think of this student as your guide, and mimic their behavior in the classroom. If they are sitting attentively with their book open, you should be doing the same., Before you open your mouth, think to yourself “Is this something that can wait?” Or “Will my teacher be upset if I interrupt to say this?” Many students talk during class because they forget to filter their thoughts before letting them escape as words. Forgetting to filter your thoughts results in blurting out whatever it is you are thinking for the whole class to hear. Take the time to really think about what you want to say during class for relevance. If it is at all disruptive, like ""This subject is boring, is class almost over?"" do not say that out loud.


A good trick is to raise your hand every time you think of something to say. While waiting for the teacher to call on you, think about whether or not what you have to say pertains to what the teacher is discussing. If it’s not related to the lesson, put your hand down and remain quiet.
Always raise your hand when you have a question about class. Not talking during class does not mean your questions about the lesson should go unanswered.

, If you find yourself with so many things to say that it’s almost impossible to stay quiet, write them down instead. Many students have a problem staying quiet when they think they have a funny joke or antidote to share with the class, this is a great alternative to interrupting the class with your joke. It also helps if you're constantly thinking of things you'd like to ask your friend during class.


Grab a piece of paper and jot down all the jokes you thought up and all the things you have to ask your friend, instead of speaking them. For instance, if you're sitting in class and remember that your mom said it was okay for your buddy to stay the night this weekend, instead of turning to ask them during class, take out your notebook and write ""Remember to tell Jimmy that my mom said it was okay for them to stay the night this weekend.""

, Although it doesn't involve talking, texting what you have to say is never a good option. You should never have your phone out during class, it distracts you from the lesson and disrupts the class when the teacher has to stop and ask you to put it away. Leave your phone tucked away in a safe place like your pocket or locker.

, Sometimes it’s not that you can’t stay quiet, but that you can’t stop responding to talkative people. Politely tell the students around you before class that you can’t talk to them until class is finished. Then ignore their comments during the lesson. They will soon figure out that you no longer talk during class and will stop trying.While out in the hallway before class, try taking your talkative classmates aside and say something like “I’m not going to talk during class anymore, so can we talk at lunch instead?”
Ignoring comments made in class can be difficult, especially if someone says something that upsets you. If this happens, write it down so you can tell the person who said it later that it upset you instead of angrily responding and disrupting the class lecture.

, There is no shame in asking someone to help you stop talking. Try asking one of your friends to give you a cue whenever you start to talk in class. Maybe they can cough or tap your shoulder. Whatever cue you decide on, make sure it doesn’t involve them talking to you at all or it defeats the purpose.

, It may seem like your teacher is always yelling at you to stop talking, but they can be a great help if you ask them. Tell your teacher you’re having a hard time not talking in class, and see if they have any suggestions for things you can try.After class, tell your teacher something like ""I'm trying really hard to stop talking during your class, but I'm still struggling with it. Could you please help me?"" More than likely, your teacher will be delighted to give you some pointers on staying quiet.

, Put a sticky note on your desk and write something on it to remind yourself not to talk. Every time you get the urge to speak, glance down at your sticky note.


Try writing something like “I can talk when class is over.” Or “Silence is golden.”

, Just keep trying to stay quiet during class. It may take some time for you to learn these new techniques, but don’t give up!


Set realistic goals for yourself, you might not be able to completely stop talking over night. To avoid frustration and getting discouraged, start by focusing on not talking at all through the first half of class. Once that becomes second nature, make your goal to not speak during the entire class.

, As you meet your goals, reward yourself with a piece of candy or 10 extra minutes of play time after school. Positive reinforcements like these will help you continue to keep up the good work.

Be alert.,
Shut yourself off.,
Don’t engage with the distractor.,
Participate in class.,
Take notes in class.,
Ask to move seats.",How to Avoid Someone Trying to Distract You in the Classroom1," Make sure your body language communicates that you’re focused and ready to learn. Lean slightly forward and keep your head up so you can see the teacher. A distracting person isn’t likely to talk to you if you look unavailable.


Try not to look bored so you don’t invite conversation.;
, Position your body away from the distractor so that they will not feel as comfortable talking to you. Keep your eyes toward the front of the classroom and your chest pointed away from them. Practice negative body language to communicate that you don’t want to listen to them.You want to make yourself appear physically cold to the person trying to distract you.

, Even if the person trying to distract you gets offended that you’re shutting them out, don’t acknowledge them. If they take your indifference personally, they may lash out at you. Don’t react to their outburst.


Make it clear to your teacher that you’re not involved in their outburst. You don’t want to get in trouble for disrupting the class.

, No one will have a chance to distract you if you’re constantly active in class discussions. Focus your attention completely on the class lecture and raise your hand to answer every question the teacher asks.

, Keep a notebook handy. Every time another student tries to get your attention, act like you’re busy writing notes. When your eyes aren’t on your teacher, keep them buried in your notebook.


Be sure to look up from time to time, you don’t want your teacher to think you’re doodling.

, Let your teacher know that you’re having trouble focusing in your current seat and ask if you can change seats away from your distractor. If there are no seats available, you can ask another student if they don’t mind switching with you.Get close to the teacher. The closer you are to the front of the class, the easier it will be for you to pay attention.
If the distractor is your friend outside of class, you may not want to get them in trouble. Give your teacher an excuse why you need a new seat. Say “I’m having trouble hearing the lecture, would you mind if I moved closer to the front of class?”

Start a conversation.,
Get to the point.,
Request feedback.,
Change your perspective.",How to Avoid Someone Trying to Distract You in the Classroom2," Wait till class is over and strike up a conversation with the person that’s distracting you. Try not to be confrontational. Rather, approach them in a friendly way so they’ll be more likely to listen to you. Calmly let them know that they’re disrupting your attention in the classroom.


Remember to always call out the behavior and not the person.Make sure they know you have nothing personal against them.
A good way to start off the conversation is with flattery. You can say something like “Your jokes are always so funny and I love to hear them when we’re not in class.”

, Be clear about your boundaries.Let the distractor know that you need to give your studies your full attention. Tell them that even if they don’t mean to, they’re affecting your ability to concentrate in class and you need them to stop.


Give specific examples of when they distracted you. Say something like: “Last Monday when you were trying to show me your new shoes in class, I had a really hard time listening to the lesson.”
Be cool. Speaking in a calm tone will be more effective towards getting the behavior to stop.

, You don’t want your conversation to become a lecture. You also want to get clarification that the distractor understands your point. After you’ve made your point clear, ask your classmate how they feel about the situation and be sure to listen closely.


Watch their body language. If they have a harsh stare or are avoiding eye contact, they’re likely getting defensive and not listening to you.Be understanding. Maybe the person didn’t realize they were bothering you and was only trying to be your friend.

, Give your distractor the benefit of the doubt and try to see the world from their viewpoint. They may be a very social person who has trouble paying attention in class. They might even need your help learning to stay on task.


If the distractor is your friend, they may just need some extra attention. Give them a hug or take some time away from class to listen to them vent.

Keep doing this everytime the distraction comes up, and eventually you will no longer notice it., Life can get really busy, so it’s no surprise if you find yourself distracted from studying by thoughts about everything else. Rather than acting like all of those other needs don’t exist, give yourself an outlet. Spend 5 minutes thinking about everything that’s on your plate, but then tell yourself it’s time to focus on the main task for now: studying., When you’ve got an exam coming up, it’s easy to think you need to study everything. Breaking things down and establishing just one primary goal makes things more manageable and you will be less prone to becoming distracted.For example, if you have a biology exam coming up that covers three chapters, you don’t have to cram everything into one study session. Try focusing first on the parts that give you trouble, like that subsection on the Krebs cycle.

, Texting, social media, calls, and other distractions that come from our electronic devices are some of the biggest barriers to staying focused when studying. Luckily, the fix is easy and totally within your control. Unplug yourself!Turn off notifications on your devices. Better still, turn them off completely.
Don’t take calls or texts. Turn off your phone if you are able, or at least keep it on silent and away.
If you can’t stop this distraction, look into apps or browser plugins that can block social media, certain websites, or any other specific outlets that pull you away from studying., It’s natural to want to procrastinate and put off the most difficult or unpleasant tasks. Your energy level at the start of a study session will be higher, however, so it’s actually best to begin with the harder things. Put off the easier tasks instead. This will keep your focus sharp when you need it most., It might seem counterintuitive, but stepping away from your studies now and then can actually be more beneficial than trying to plow through everything without stopping. About once an hour, get up and take a short break of about 5 minutes. This helps refresh you so that you can stay focused when you come back to studying.Moving around a bit, such as by taking a brief walk, will be most beneficial.

, Some people imagine that knocking out several things at once means you can work faster. Attempting to multitask, such as doing your homework while watching TV or shopping online, will cause you to lose your focus. Instead concentrate on one task at a time."

Set a study schedule.,
Change subjects every two hours.,
Give in to your distraction as a reward.",How to Avoid Distractions While Studying2," When you have many classes or things to study for, it can seem hard to get through everything. Give yourself a schedule where you set specific times to study particular subjects. This makes studying seem less overwhelming, helping you to stay on task.For example, you might decide to study biology for an hour on Monday night, followed by an hour of English. Then, on Tuesday afternoons, you study Math for two hours.
Keep your schedule, but be flexible when needed. For example, if you have a biology exam coming up on Tuesday, you might study Biology for two hours on Monday night, and put English off for Tuesday.
If you are studying around other people, post your schedule so they will know when it’s not ok to distract you.

, A little variety keeps you refreshed and focused. If you try to study one thing for too long, your energy level and attention span will go way down. Switch things up to combat this. For instance, after two hours of Math, take a short break then switch to studying English., Distractions can actually be used in a positive way, and an incentive to get you through your studying. Say you need to study Geometry for an hour but keep getting distracted by funny cat videos. Tell yourself that if you get through the hour of studying without being distracted, you’ll then let yourself watch all the cat videos you want."

Find a place that makes you want to study.,
Let others know if you’re studying at home.,
Use music only if you’re sure it helps you stay focused.",How to Avoid Distractions While Studying3," If the books and seriousness of the library put you in the mood for focusing on Trigonometry, go for it. If the comfy chairs and coffee at your local cafe are what you need to get through your reading for English, go there. The most important thing is that the location motivates you to study.Most people like a place that is neither too cold nor too warm.
A study space shouldn’t be loud. Some people prefer a place that is absolutely quiet, others like a little background noise.
If you are often distracted by studying, choose a seat that faces a wall rather than a window, hallway, or other seats.

, Put a sign on your door that lets others know you’re studying. This will keep them from distracting you.You can also message your friends, tell them when you’re studying, and ask them not to disturb you during that time.

, Studies about whether or not music helps you focus when studying are mixed. If you feel like listening to music keeps you energized and focused on studying, you can use it. Keep a couple things in mind, however:The music should be fairly quiet.
Choose music that has no words so you’ll be less likely to become distracted.
Consider listening to “white noise” tracks for background noise instead of music.

Take in as much comedy as possible.,
Have a good knowledge of pop culture in general.,
Perfect your timing.,
Avoid trying to be funny all the time.,
Stay relaxed in class.,
Smile more often.,
Practice speaking.,
Work on your tone of voice.,
Be careful and don't clown with every teacher.,
Know when to stop.,
Avoid practical jokes or comments that can hurt people.",How to Be a Class Clown," Listen to comedy albums and watch stand-up specials. Read joke books and other humorous publications. Watch funny movies and television shows.


You do not want to repeat jokes that you've heard word-for-word. Instead, use these references as a guide for figuring out what's funny. Observe how your favorite comedians phrase their bits and how they say them. Incorporate aspects of that into your own style.;
, A lot of the quick jokes you can make in class will be references to some movie, television show, or song that most of your classmates know. If your references are too obscure, your jokes will probably fall flat.Use catchphrases sparingly. A well-timed catchphrase can be funny, but repeating the same stale line too often will get annoying.

, Try to be as spontaneous and quick-witted as possible. Delivery and timing are some of the most important elements of comedy. You will need to think quickly in class in order to come up with the right funny comment at the perfect time. If you come up with the perfect response to something that was said a few minutes earlier, don't say it out loud. Wait until the quip becomes relevant again., If you joke around too much, your teacher is more likely to see you as a disruption. Likewise, your classmates may get tired of your shtick and think you're doing it for attention. Save your ""on"" time for when you think you have a really good joke to say., An important part of being the class clown is to take on a laidback, confident persona. If you are relaxed, your jokes will come easier and confidence will improve your delivery. The best thing you can do to both calm down and speak with clarity is to practice breathing. If you're feeling nervous, take deep (but not so exaggerated as to attract attention) breaths. Inhale and exhale slowly.

, Making yourself smile will help you to be funnier in two ways: First, smiling is infectious. If you're smiling, your classmates and teacher are more likely to laugh at your jokes.Second, smiling will reduce stress and make you feel less nervous.Don't wear a huge, obviously-forced grin or smile at inappropriate times. Doing either might make people think you're weird.

, This may seem to clash with the need to be spontaneous. However, the two are not mutually exclusive. Instead of practicing jokes to say line for line, simply work on how you talk. Use your phone, computer, or tape recorder so you can listen to how you sound to others.


Make sure your voice is clear and loud without yelling. You want everyone in the room to be able to hear your jokes clearly. Class clowns won't get laughs with a half-hearted mumble.

, Although tone of voice is an extremely important part of social communication, most people are not consciously aware of choosing one.While listening to comedians, you may have noticed that few sound like someone having a normal conversation. Instead, they talk in a way that both adds to the humor and makes it clear that they are joking. Try to develop your own way of doing this without totally copying another comedian.

, Some teachers are very strict when it comes to talking out of turn, while others may encourage it. If you know a teacher is strict or quick to anger, save your jokes for a different class. Try to develop a rapport with instructors who do appreciate your humor.

, An important part of avoiding detention while being a class clown is to keep things toned down. Don't talk too much and keep your comments brief. Even if your teacher is normally tolerant of your jokes, if you notice him or her becoming upset or angry, it's best to cut your ""act"" short.

, Even the most harmless practical joke can backfire if you go to a school with a ""zero-tolerance"" policy. Don't do any pranks that involve touching another student or making a mess.Additionally, always remember to watch your words and don't tease your classmates. You can be funny without being mean."

Make sure not to block important sites. Carefully follow the instructions for your extension and ensure that you’re not blocking websites you might need access to, such as your email or bank account.

, Sometimes the most distracting part of being online is the pings and pop-ups displayed to show activity on your online accounts. Turning off notifications will disconnect you from those sites when you’re not using them.


On Facebook, click Settings in the top right corner and choose Account settings, then the Notifications to disable email notifications.
On Twitter, click the profile icon, select Settings, and click on Email Notifications., Cell phones connected to the Internet are tempting sources of distraction. Turning your phone off or on silent and putting it out of your line of sight eliminates the temptation to check social media or texts.

, Under no circumstances answer a phone call at anytime in a classroom. The bathroom, however, is a great place to answer the phone, as teachers are not present.

, If you are expecting the call and are just awaiting the info the caller intends to pass along, simply answer discretely and hold the phone up to the non-teacher ear and listen. Simple as that, then just slide it back into its place of holding

, Knowing beforehand what you want to accomplish online will keep you more focused while browsing the Internet. Before you open your browser, for example, set a goal of completing research for a paper within one hour., Before resorting to technological tools, try setting self-imposed limits for yourself.

, Even if it seems boring to you, do not sleep, stare at the clock, play with your fingers, or just sit there. This will make you forget about all the information the teacher discusses and will result in a bad grade. Paying attention helps you focus on the topic and subject more and will help you ace tests.

, If you don't do it at school, this will result in extra homework which can build stress. If you're doing the work with a partner, do not just fool around and ignore the whole project.

, The easy solution is to start assignments the day they are given to you. That way you have a head start and your mind has already started considering the content.

, If you have an essay on WWII due Monday, don't tell your friends that you have no plans and that, sure you can hang out. Guilt will come back and haunt you with a bad grade.


If a project is due on a Monday, take it home over the weekend. Even if you have plans for the weekend, squeeze in at least one hour for work time. A little music in the background at a low level might help.







, Find a standard place to your homework and stick to it. Most of all, avoid doing your homework during a lesson.

, For example, you could dress in a crazy and cute outfit, wear a cape, do your makeup differently, or do some funny, yet safe stunts.

"
"
Plan a performance for the class.,
Stay focused on your schoolwork.",How to Have a Fun Last Day of School3," You and your friends could prepare a dance or a song to do for the class. Prepare something quick and try to schedule the performance during lunch. Teachers usually won't mind if you all sing a goodbye song. Don't be afraid!


Research a popular song and learn any of the accompanying dance moves. Invent new ones if there isn't a dance for the song yet. Perform the dance for anyone who is interested!
If you and your friends love a particular movie or T.V. show, memorize a scene from it and then perform for other friends who also like the movie or T.V. show.

, It's important to stay focused if you have tests or additional assignments to complete on the last day of class. Despite all the fun you might be having, complete everything to the best of your ability.


If you are easily distracted by your cell phone, turn it off or put somewhere far away from where it might distract you.
Think about the summer break and how much free time you will have soon. This will make even the most boring of classes seem exciting all of the sudden.
Remember not to complain; the more you do, the longer the school day will take.

"
"
Exchange phone numbers with everyone.,
Say goodbye to your teachers.,
Say goodbye to all of your friends.,
Have a great summer vacation.",How to Have a Fun Last Day of School4," It's important to maintain contact with those friends who you really like.


Throughout the school day, ask all of your friends for their numbers, and then write them in your yearbook or notebook.
Don't be embarrassed to ask your crush for his or her number. If they say no, don't worry about it; it's the last day of school. You won't have to see that person for another three months! If they say yes, then consider taking it a step further.
Ask your crush if they would want to go on a date, or maybe even try to sneak in a first kiss. Anything is possible, just don't do anything reckless.

, Sure, they gave you all that homework, all those boring lessons, and maybe a detention or two, but your teachers worked hard and surely taught you something valuable during the year. Show them your gratitude with a simple farewell. If you're at a loss for words, here are some examples of nice things to say to a few of your teachers:


""I appreciate all of your hard work this year. Thank you! Have a great summer.""
""Sorry if I talked too much sometimes. I learned a lot from you. Goodbye!""
""Thanks so much, teacher!""

, Apologize to everyone--especially your enemies and teachers. You don't want to be guilty over a tiny squabble for the rest of your life do you? Plus it'll make people feel good. Be nice, you'll make other people happy. Don't complain, whine, be rude, or become upset. It might annoy other people.


Give your friends some big final hugs and tell them why they are special to you. Don't be surprised if a few tears are shed (bring some tissues if you are the crying type).
Keep your spirits up if you are feeling sad about leaving your school and your friends. Life goes on, and plus, you might see them sooner than you think.

, When the final bell rings, grab your bag, and make a mad dash out of the building! Enjoy your summer vacation and don't forget to read a few books.

Walk confidently onto the stage.,
Look the presenter in the eye.,
Take the diploma with your left hand and shake the presenter’s hand with your right.,
Continue to watch your step as you walk offstage.,
Know when to change the tassel.",How to Accept a Diploma1," Stand up straight, keep your chin up, and don’t slouch. Walk with confidence and take pride in your accomplishment. However, mind your footing, and make sure you don't trip on your gown!


Note if you’ve received any instructions about standing up with your row at the same time, or about how to line up and proceed to the stage.
Sometimes schools or universities will have you hold onto a name card or name pronunciation card. Know if this is the procedure, and hand it over to the proper usher when the time comes.;
, Whether it’s your dean, school principal, or another distinguished person, show them respect by looking them in the eye. You also want to avoid just looking at the floor or keeping your head down since you’ll probably have family and friends taking pictures of you every step of the way. Do your best to look photogenic:Remember to smile, or look happy or proud to be where you are.
Try to look at your family and friends when they take your picture.

, Once you approach the presenter, reach out with your left hand to take your diploma. As the presenter hands you the diploma, reach with your right hand to shake hands. Be graceful with your hand motions, and don’t just grab the diploma and hold it at your side.While you’re on stage, keep the diploma raised up after you’ve accepted it and shaken hands.

Shake your presenter’s hand firmly.
If you wear dangly bracelets on your right hand, consider not wearing them for the ceremony or wearing them on your left hand instead.Don’t run away after you’ve accepted your diploma. There will most likely be a professional photographer on hand who will take your picture either as you receive your diploma or immediately after shaking the presenter’s hand., It’s easy to lose focus and feel like you’re all set after you’ve accepted your diploma. However, remember that there’s still an audience out there, and you don’t want to trip and fall or look sloppy. Continue to mind your footing, keep your head up, and walk with confidence.


Again, either professional photographers or family members will be taking your picture, so proudly present the symbol of your accomplishments.

, The tassel on your cap symbolizes your transition from student to graduate. Some schools or colleges will have you move your own tassel when you receive your diploma, or have the presenter to do it for you. Sometimes, all graduates proceed with tassel change in unison after everyone’s received their diploma.


Traditionally, the tassel is worn on the right side of the cap before graduating, then is switched to the left side during tassel change.
Your ceremony’s organizers will give you more information on details like tassel change at your graduation rehearsal.

"
"
Be on time for every graduation-related ceremony.,
Prepare everything you need in advance of the big day.,
Attend your school’s graduation rehearsal.,
Practice with your friends or family.",How to Accept a Diploma2," Give yourself plenty of time to get ready on the big day, and be on time or early for all graduation-related ceremonies. If graduation is being held somewhere other than your school, familiarize yourself with the ceremony’s location and parking situation.Showing up late is a sign of disrespect to your peers, your school, and yourself.
Even more important than showing respect, being late will just stress you out and make you even more anxious.

, Set yourself up for success so you’ll be nice and relaxed when you receive your diploma. Make sure you have your outfit and shoes picked out at least a day or two before graduation day. Keep any tassels, cords, or medallions with your cap and gown.


Make sure the clothes and shoes you choose match the graduation ceremony's dress code.
Hang up your gown so it doesn’t get wrinkled.
If the gown is wrinkled even if you've been hanging it for days, bring it in the bathroom with you when you take a hot shower. The steam will help release the wrinkles.

, Don’t skip out on the rehearsal. It’s always best to have an idea of how any ceremony will proceed, and you’ll be much more confident knowing where you need to be and when. Your teachers, professors, deans, or other ceremony organizers will let you know where and how to line up, go over the ceremony’s timing, and inform you about other important details.


You’ll also most likely receive instructions during the rehearsal about how to properly receive a diploma as you shake the presenter’s hand.
If you are really nervous, you can ask someone there, like a teacher or administrator, after the rehearsal for a little extra help.
You might also have the opportunity to practice walking across the stage. Knowing where you have to walk and getting a feel for being on stage can be a lot easier when you don’t have hundreds of people in the audience.
Finally, you’ll receive more specific information about any professional photographers that your school has hired for the event. You’ll find out exactly when you’re getting your picture taken and when you should smile for the camera.

, Asking a friend, parent, or other family member for a little help can help you master the technique of receiving a diploma, especially if it’s your first time receiving a diploma. Use a folder or a magazine as a stand-in for the diploma. Pretend that the person helping you is the actual presenter, and practice walking up and shaking hands.


If you’ve received your gown in advance, try practicing with your gown and with whatever shoes you’re wearing to become more comfortable walking.

"
"
Avoid boasting or making a scene onstage.,
Return to your seat and let your peers have their moment.,
Let your excitement out when it comes time to throw hats.",How to Accept a Diploma3," Some graduates pump their fists while they’re on stage or grab the diploma without shaking the presenter’s hand.Being on stage is certainly a proud moment, and it’s the conclusion to years of hard work. However, this type of celebrating is disrespectful, distracts from other graduates, and takes away from the prestige of the graduation ceremony. There will be plenty of time to jump for joy later.


Remember, the title of the song played at many graduations is “Pomp and Circumstance,” which implies that the ceremony involves dignity, formality, and tradition., Before and after receiving your diploma, allow your friends and fellow students to have their own proud moments. Don’t be a distraction, and don’t applaud or shout out to your friends when they cross the stage. The person who announces the names of the graduates will most likely direct the audience to withhold applause until the end, so you should respectfully follow suit.

, Some graduation ceremonies include hat-throwing or drop confetti. That’s when you can scream, shout, and jump for joy. Be proud of yourself and your accomplishments, and breathe a big sigh of relief.


If you don't want to have to search for your cap after tossing it, you can always just wave your cap in the air.
Keep your diploma on hand after the ceremony to take photos with your friends and family.
While you're celebrating, make sure to keep your diploma in good condition, especially if you receive the actual copy at the ceremony. Don't lose it, and keep it safe so you can proudly display it in a prominent place when you get home.

Keep up with your school work.,
Always make sure that your teacher feels like they have been missed.,
Get him/her a gift.,
Always keep your supplies organized.,
Be punctual.,
Avoid going overboard.,
Be polite!,
Never gossip about the teacher to your friends.,
On special occasions like Christmas, Birthdays and Teachers' Day, It is okay to give them special tokens of appreciation.,
Ask questions!,
If you feel that if your teacher is frustrated tell them that you hope they feel better after.

,
Talk to them!,
Do not bribe the teacher.,
Know that some teachers do not enjoy their jobs and nothing can be done about their temper.",How to Get On Your Teacher's Good Side," Teachers hate nothing more than having to force students to do their homework and see the kids' eyes roll (that can sometimes be insulting). If you really want to be a teacher's favorite do extra work or put extra effort into all of your work. Who knows, you may even get extra credit for it! Show interest in the subject your teacher is teaching.;
, For example, a teacher has been off sick for a while, just come up to them and have the courage to say 'Glad to see you back Sir/Miss! It will make them feel happier., You could buy them a cheap present like a candle but making something yourself really shows them your appreciation.

, This will show the teacher that you really care about your education, plus it will help you keep track of assignments!

, That being stated, do not skip class under any circumstances! Always being late or not showing up at all is the quickest way to get on a teacher’s bad side. If you do happen to be late, however, explain your reason (if possible, bring a letter from a parent or a pass) and apologize.

, Be nice but don’t overdo it. A well placed compliment and general courtesy will get you so much farther than being a suck up. Be friendly, but again, not too friendly. Humor can get you far, but jokes at inappropriate times are very detrimental to your status. Find out how friendly you can get with your teacher be observing how she interacts with your class and the other students. See what advice other students have to give about her. If she is super serious and permits no nonsense, you should be very well behaved in that class. If she seems more friendly, try joking around with her, making a few interesting and preferably relevant comments or jokes on the same topic as the lesson, but stop if appears to be upsetting or annoying her.

, Brown-nosing is not appreciated. Teachers are your superiors, and deserve the utmost respect. One of the oldest and best ways to win someone’s favour is to BE POLITE. Let your teacher see that you are glad to be in his/her class. It is as simple as that. Compliments are always good, but please don't go overboard and be a suck-up. Thank them for the lesson and be very courteous. Remember they are people too, no matter how alien they seem at times. You can offer him/her help if it appears she might appreciate it, but if she refuses you, do NOT make it a habit, it will only annoy her.

, What goes around comes around, so mind what you say. Complaining about tests or homework is generally accepted, but personal insults or attacks are not. Show interest and express your sincere thanks after the explanation.

, It is optional and if you do decide to give a small gift it doesn't have to be an expensive item; it can be simple or handmade. It should not be anything too personal, but can be a little personal; for example, if she always talks about a special pet she has, get her a themed picture frame. A safe bet is something for the subject she teaches, like a poster in French for French class. Books are good.

, Teachers like students who are curious to know more about something. Just do not ask too many questions. One here or there is okay, it shows you are paying attention.

,, If you have the last class of the day, tell them a joke or something you know will make them laugh. Or when you leave, say, ""Bye! See you later!"" Maybe when you see them walking in the hall wave to them or say hello. Teachers like students to be themselves around them. Sure, the occasional polite student is disciplined but teachers are more likely to go for the people who mess up and are ok with it! Have a good attitude and be confident.

, He or she is unlikely to accept the bribe but you might get in trouble! Better safe than sorry.

, Don't feel bad. These kind of teachers are really very hard, almost impossible, to be won over. You can do that by being really good in their subject and never doing anything less than perfect. Who knows, you might even change their views about their job!

Plan your time and organise yourself.",How to Get a Teacher to Raise Your Grade," Before you approach your teacher, it’s good to have as clear an idea as possible about what you want to ask them and what you hope to achieve through the conversation. You might be surprised to find that your teacher is well-aware of the academic problems you are having, but it’s best to be prepared to explain yourself clearly.


It could help to write down some of your queries. Don’t go in and read a script, but this could be a useful way for you to visualise your concerns and put them down on paper.;
, Before you approach your teacher spend some time just thinking about the context of your grades. Have they dropped off dramatically? Are they in a steady decline? Or do you think they do not reflect the work you are putting in?


A teacher is highly likely to begin by asking you ‘what do you think is going wrong?’ You’re hoping to get to the bottom of that together, but have some answers prepared. If you’re stumped, be ready to admit that and ask for help: ‘I don’t know why my grades are so low, can you help me understand that, and improve them?’

, When you are thinking about what to say, be as positive and co-operative as possible. Don’t think of your teacher as the enemy blocking you off from good grades.

, If possible, be specific as to what you want to talk about, be it a grade, an assignment or more general concerns. Meet before or after school. Keep in mind that how the teacher's day went may make him/her more willing to give you a second chance. Every school is different, but one thing you can assume is that your teachers will be very busy and probably not a little stressed, so bear this in mind. Be accommodating and gracious.


If you want to talk about something very particular, let the teacher know in advance. This will give them a chance to prepare any materials they might want to bring along.
If you want to have a more general chat, say something open like ‘I was wondering if I could talk you after school’, or ‘I need some advice and was hoping I could chat to you about it’.

, Be kind, appreciative, and polite to the teacher; they will take you more seriously this way. Blaming the teacher won't work. (However, don’t be a suck-up, even if your situation is dire. Suck-ups are both obvious and annoying.)


Your teacher will be impressed by you seeking out help and advice, but be sure to ask for guidance rather than demanding the answers outright.
Use conciliatory not accusatory language. ‘I want to understand why I’m not getting the grades I expected to achieve, I was wondering if you can talk to me about where I am going wrong’.
Don’t say ‘why do you keep failing me?’. Show you are taking responsibility by saying something like: ‘I am failing, and I want to improve with your help’.

, Show your commitment by explaining that you have already thought about what you can do to improve, and ask for tips on implementing your ideas. By doing this, you are demonstrating that you are not afraid of hard work, and that you understand that the teacher has knowledge and skills that can be beneficial for you.


If you have worked out a timetable for studying, ask them to look over it.
They will have an idea of your strengths and weakness, so say ‘can you tell me which things I should focus on most of all?’

, If you’re struggling in a class, don’t wait until the exam comes around. It’s best to approach your teacher and ask to have a chat about your work long before the exams begin. If you can identify and address the problems you are having early you can avoid bad grades in the first place.


You will also be seen as proactive, attentive and interested in your work.

, If your teacher only sees you once a week, it can be hard for them to know too much about you outside of class, and whether there are any circumstances that are making it hard for you to keep up with your studies. Don’t be afraid to talk about this to a teacher. Don’t try to absolve all responsibility, but rather give the teacher a full picture so they can understand what’s going on.


Chances are they want to understand the reasons why things are going wrong so they can better help you put them right.If you are having problems at home, you might prefer to talk to the school counsellor (if you have one). But if you have a teacher you trust and have a good relationship with, they could be the best choice., If you thought everything was going okay, but then had a really hard time in the exam, don't wait until progress reports or midterm grades are handed out. Waiting until after your grade comes out shows a lack of initiative; if you know you’ve done poorly -- especially if there’s a good reason for it -- you should bring it up right away. Not only that, but term grades often can’t be changed once they’re entered into the system. (This also goes for assignments from the semester/quarter before.)


If you are in this situation, try improving your grade for the upcoming marking period. Ask for extra-credit work so that you can shift your point average.

, If you want to talk your teacher and potentially challenge a grade you have received you need to understand the system they are using, how this influences grades and the limitations it imposes.Do they use a grading curve? Was it an especially high-performing class? Knowing these things can help you understand the process behind the grading of your papers.

, Your ability to question your grade is a lot more straightforward if the test was one which had objectively correct or incorrect answers. An essay question where answers are open to at least a degree of interpretation can be much more complicated and harder to dispute. In these cases you have to remember that the person marking is not a computer and subjectivity plays a part in their responses.


In the case of an essay question, you can ask your teacher to go through your answer with you. Reading your essay together will give you the opportunity to understand in more detail how it was graded., Whether it’s because you are making a good effort in class or you had a stumble along the road, you need a good reason in order for this to work. Don’t try to blag it on the spot. Whatever you might think, your teacher isn’t that dumb. If you are experiencing personal problems that have contributed to your grade, don’t be afraid to talk to your teacher about it.

, Calmly and professionally say what you believe is wrong with your grade. Present other tests and assignments that demonstrate what you’re capable of, and suggest the solution you think is reasonable. Be convincing and confident, but don’t assume to know more or better than your teacher.


Find good assignments to use as examples or backup. If you can demonstrate that your low score was a fluke and shouldn’t drag down your entire grade, you stand a much better chance of getting it changed.
If the problem was that you had an unreliable teammate in a group project, don’t blame it all on him/her or you’ll seem like a bad team player. Instead, say that if you’d given him/her extra help, you wouldn't have done as well on your half of the project, and that it’s not fair to get a bad grade because of somebody else’s work.

, This will depend on what your situation is. For example, if you did poorly on a single assignment, ask to redo it for partial credit. However, if you have a C- in the class and want to have it raised to an A- just by redoing a few assignments, your teacher will most likely say no; instead, offer to do a lot of extra credit to prove how motivated you are. It might not shoot your grade up to an A, but it’ll certainly help.

, Instead of just doing your homework, highlight important parts and write neatly, and especially make sure that everything is legible and it doesn't look like it got mangled with by a prizefighter. This may add a few extra points, since many teachers count neatness as part of your homework grade. If you are turning in a report, it may be helpful to purchase a report cover to further demonstrate your care for your final product.


Consider trying to mark someone’s work whose handwriting is all but impossible to read. Think about how much extra time this must take.

, Sometimes opportunities for extra credit will not be so obvious, so it’s important to be on the lookout and to be visibly keen. Teachers will be impressed by someone going the extra mile. Not only will you score extra credit marks, but you can make a lasting good impression on your teacher.

, If any of these things seem unlikely to work on your teacher, don't try them. It will be a disaster. Follow steps you’re comfortable with and change/skip those you aren’t. You know your teacher best, and, believe it or not, they know you too.


Although extra credit can be extremely helpful, it’s not meant to make up for your faults. Extra credit is designed to help bring students who have been trying in the past to further bring their grades up. It’s unlikely that a teacher will assign enough extra credit to change an F to an A.

, If you can put everything you and your teacher discussed into practice in the long-term it’s likely your grades will improve, stay good and get even better. While you’re at it, stay on your best behavior for a while: participate in discussions, don’t interrupt anyone, and don’t chitchat with your friends in class. Teachers will be much more sympathetic to a hard working student who is struggling to achieve good grades than one who gets by doing as little as possible.

, Keep up the good work and be organised and enthusiastic about learning outside of the classroom. If you are able to evidence outside learning in a classroom and demonstrate enthusiasm and interest in a subject, it will set you apart from your classmates. By doing more reading around topics you will find that you have more to contribute in class and that will make a very positive impression on your teacher., Bad grades can often be a result of rushed work, hasty last-minute cramming, or poorly thought out projects. In order to make it possible to improve your grades, a good step is to make sure you avoid these frantic moments as much as possible. Organise your time and plan your work schedule in advance. This way, if you are struggling with a topic you will have more opportunity to work on it and seek some advice before you are tested.


It’s a great feeling for a teacher to see a student improve. Your teacher will be delighted to see your grades go up when you put into practice the things you talked about together.

Make invented excuses sound as plausible as possible.,
Mutilate your assignment so you teacher can't tell you didn't actually do the work.,
Make an excuse based on technological malfunctions.,
Try a less inventive excuses that might still work, like: your homework fell out of your bag, you grabbed the wrong folder at home, you had a funeral to go to.

,
Fake it, when possible.,
Avoid excuses that will backfire on you.",How to Excuse Yourself from Unfinished Homework1," If your only option seems to be making up a more elaborate excuse—or if you just want to be daring—do so carefully. Many common excuses, like “my dog ate my homework,” are familiar to teachers and they will not believe them. It is difficult to outsmart a teacher who has years of experience working with students and their excuses. Teachers are familiar with many excuses, and can often recognize outlandish ones as untrue. , Turn in the illegible or destroyed assignment, so that you can show your “proof” of your excuse.


Crumple and tear a paper assignment. Then you can tell the teacher that it flew out the window and got run over or trampled on.
Smear dirt and water on your assignment and claim it fell in a puddle.
Spill something dark (like juice or ink) on the assignment so that it is illegible.

,


For instance, if you have to save work to a USB drive, you can claim to have a problem with the file.
If you are asked to email or otherwise electronically send a homework file, you can “accidentally” send a different assignment, or the “wrong” draft (which could have just your name and the first part of the assignment, for instance). You might even be able to purchase corrupted files. Be aware that your teachers can be tech-savvy and know all of these tricks, so you might have to get creative. ,, For instance, with math work you can write random figures or answers to make it look like you did the work. This might take a lot of time, however, and if your teacher looks closely you might get caught.

, For instance, if you tell your teacher that you forgot your homework in your locker, he or she can just ask you to go and get it, and you will be caught.

Try harder to impress your teacher by having good marks, especially in classes you're not as good at.,

Don't forget your homework at home.,
Be creative.,
Find a common interest.,
Do work ahead.,
Do outside research.,
Do extra credit assignments.",How to Get a Teacher to Like You," Be positive and help others and soon your teacher will like you. Being positive will show your teacher you respect everyone and are willing to give a helping hand when needed. If your fellow student does not understand something, you could offer to explain it to them if the teacher is tired or busy. This will show that you have character as a student wishing to learn and share. Teachers adore this kind of attitude.;
, Some teachers like for students to be quiet, and ask questions only when it is necessary, while others will want you to always report back to them to show interest in the lesson. Learn what your teacher likes by watching reactions to other students. Once you know what they like, do it as much as possible.

, Praise others' work and even make positive suggestions. Being supportive and understanding will show your are compassionate and dedicated to help others. Most teachers enjoy seeing this.

, This way you are asking for trouble (and you could annoy your classmates). The next thing is that you will be thrown into helping after school without a doubt. Volunteer to help or participate in an after school project periodically but not for every activity. This will demonstrate that you are interested and responsible without spreading yourself too thin or taking all of the glory.

, Avoid entering conversations as this will make your teacher think you were involved in the whole thing. Try only to speak when asked or doing group work. Talking back to your teacher will probably just embarrass you and make your teacher angry.

, Take it a step further by making casual conversation with them, either after or before class. If they mentioned something specific about their family, ask how it is going, especially if it was something stressful or difficult. The teacher feels like you have enough respect to care about them as a person, and not just see them as the evil figure. Also, if the teacher has a good sense of humor, joke with them occasionally.

, At the very least this means that you don't back-talk, insult or antagonize the teacher. This might be difficult, especially with teachers who are just plain mean. But if you are polite to them, they will seem dumb being rude to you. Also, do whatever the teacher says as soon as possible. Just following directions can go a long way. It is always a good idea to greet your teachers when you see him/her. Find out their birthday and congratulate them. Respect your teacher. Make sure that you are always on time.

, If you talk out of turn while the teacher or another student is talking they will think you are rude and disrespectful.

, If you ask a dumb question or ask something that she/he has already said, it shows that you weren't paying attention!

, When your teacher is explaining something, wait for him or her to finish. If you still don't understand, you can ask your question, but if you wait it out, there's a good chance your teacher will answer your question without you asking it. Teachers don't like to be interrupted because it's a sign of disrespect and can also get in the way of their plans.

, As well as looking attentive during the lesson, you should be acting engaged. Teachers appreciate students who nod when they understand something. Ask questions if you don't understand something, and the teacher will be happy to answer it for you. If a teacher asks the class questions, answer questions that you know the answers to. It shows that you can learn and retain information, which is really what teachers want to see. Especially give an answer like a 'yes' or a 'no' when asked a question. Keeping mum when questioned makes the teacher feel that no one is alert or attentive. Speak up in the class without wondering what your classmates will think of you and the teachers will respect you for participating and paying attention. It would also show that you are making an effort to learn the material. If something doesn't make sense to you, ask it. If you disagree with something the teacher said, say it, but don't be rude and if they defend their point, retract yours.

, Always complete any assigned homework. Always respect your teacher, your classmates, the rules, school and etc. This attitude helps you be prepared for anything.

, Don't talk to your friends during a lecture. Don't send text messages, or constantly stare at the clock, or otherwise you will show that teacher that you couldn't care less about what he or she is saying. Be respectful and appear motivated — even if the topic is very boring. There's nothing more that a teacher doesn't like than a student who is ignoring him/her. Try looking at the teachers in the eyes when possible, and smile when they look at you. Don't laugh or giggle. Laugh at your teacher's ""jokes"".

, Write things down: when, where, what, who. Don't repeatedly ask the teacher for basic facts that were already given. For example: do not ask your teacher what chapter you are supposed to read. You should always have a way to take notes when in class and pay attention. Show that you do care and wish to learn.

, Get to know them better, ask about them. Asking if they had a nice weekend it shows that you like and are interested in them. Commenting on their appearance, or simply just talking to them will create a friendly bond. They are also regular people like you and your friends. But there are some teachers who do not speak much about personal life. Hence, you must rely on their reactions about who entertains friendly conversations.

, If you don't, you may have to do it again and then you will be one step behind the rest of your class.

, If you don't do your homework, don't fake it. Offer to do extra credit to make up for the missed assignment. Be honest about it and apologize. Most teachers, if not all, appreciate honesty over white lies.

, Come up with a system for keeping it with you, e.g., while you are doing your homework keep your binder and bag next to you and when you are finished put it in there.

, A good way to get a teacher to like you make him/her a homemade thank you card and they will be pleased. Go beyond the expectations on projects. Have a little fun with their assignments!

, Maybe you both love that sports team, or maybe you both obsess over animated movies. This can be something to talk about when you finish your work early and your teacher is not busy. If they know you know they have real interests like you and your classmates, they will like you more.


On a special day for the teacher, get them something that has one of their interests. For example, their birthday. This will show them that you are thinking about them!

, When you can, complete and hand your homework in advance. It suggests that you care about the class. There's also not a chance of forgetting it at home the day it's due.

, This doesn't mean you have to write an essay or anything. It just means that you take what you've learned in class a step further. Ask your teacher a question that may not be related to the specific topic you're learning, but is related to their field. This may be especially useful if it is a thought-provoking question or a question you've had for awhile. It also can mean that you found out more about something you're learning that the teacher didn't mention or a new perspective. Teachers like seeing this because it shows that you care enough about the topic to do a little something extra.

, This will help boost your grade and get the teacher to like you even more. Try doing two or three extra credit assignments, and try to pick the semi-hard ones, not any too hard that you don't understand how to do, but also not so ridiculously easy that the teacher will think that you are not capable of doing work harder than that.

Speak to the teacher about your concerns.,
Make sure that your complaint about the teacher is valid.,
Keep track of any incidents.,
Gather proof.,
Report the misconduct to the principal.,
Ask what happens next.",How to Fire a Teacher1," If you are student who is experiencing issues with a teacher, your first move should be to talk to them about it. Ask to speak to the teacher privately after class. Calmly explain to the teacher what you think they’re doing that’s inappropriate. Give the teacher a chance to explain themselves and improve their bad behavior.


Start the conversation with something like, “I want to speak to you about something that is upsetting me.”
Remember to stay calm. Practice what you want to say ahead of time.
A simple conversation isn't always going to be an option. Sometimes the misconduct is too severe to approach the teacher with. If you feel uncomfortable or afraid to speak with the teacher, don’t do it.;
, Understand that in order to terminate a teacher, one of the following must be proven: immoral conduct, incompetence, neglect of duty, substantial noncompliance with school laws, conviction of a crime, insubordination, fraud or misrepresentation.The teacher’s conduct must fall under one of these descriptions.


“Substantial noncompliance with school laws” means that the teacher frequently breaks the school districts rules. Examples: not allowing a student to practice their religion and not treating all students equally.“Immoral conduct” is any form of sexual contact or abuse to the students, indecent exposure, stalking a student, extreme obscenity, having a weapon on school grounds, having an explosive device, having drug paraphernalia, and/or selling drugs to minors.“Incompetence” is when a teacher is extremely ineffective at teaching. “Neglect of duty” is when a teacher fails to teach at all. Both have the same end result – the students don’t learn anything.
If you do decide to make the complaint, report only the facts. Never do anything that could leave you open to charges of slander or libel.

, Start keeping a list of negative incidents and examples of the teacher’s misconduct. Be fair in your evaluation. Keep track of the date and time each incident occurs. If there are any other witnesses, write their names down. Make sure your teacher doesn’t see you doing this. If you have to, jot down notes that only you could understand, then write the full incident down after class.


Write down the events truthfully.

, If there is a way for you to safely record audio or take photographs/video of the incidents when they happen, do it. This will help your case whenever you take your complaint to school officials. In some states it is illegal to record another person without their knowledge and consent.If the teacher is doing something so bad that you think there will be a court case about it, your proof may not be admissible in court.


However, your proof will definitely get the attention of your school officials, and they can begin monitoring the teacher.
Firing a teacher can be a long and difficult process, so the sooner school officials can begin their investigation, the sooner that teacher will be out of the classroom., It would probably be helpful for you to take a friend, parent, or guardian along with you when you do this. Bring your list of incidents and any proof you’ve gathered to this meeting and present it to the principal. Calmly explain your side of the story. If you tried to speak with the teacher about this problem, make sure to let the principal know that. If there were any witnesses, make sure you provide those names.


Make sure you give the principal copies of your evidence, whether it’s video, audio or photographs. You should keep the originals, just in case. Keep this evidence private.
Report only the facts.

, After you’ve provided all of the information you have, ask what steps are going to be taken against the teacher. If this is the first time this teacher has ever been reported and the misconduct isn’t dangerous, criminal or immoral, the principal will probably tell you that they’re going to start monitoring the teacher and/or give the teacher a warning. The school board is required to go through a very particular process in order to dismiss a teacher, and those two things are the first step.If the teacher is fairly new at your school (usually if they've been there less than 3 years), it’s possible that the teacher might be dismissed immediately.Request that your report remain anonymous whenever possible.
While the school board carries out their investigation, ask to be placed into another class with a different teacher. You shouldn’t have to endure any more of the misconduct.

"
"
Make it seem like you did the work on time, even if you didn't.,
Claim to be sick.,
Ask a parent to write an excuse for you.",How to Excuse Yourself from Unfinished Homework2,"


If the missed homework is for a class late in the day, you might be able to do the work before school, during another class, or during lunch or a break.
You can hand in the wrong assignment—such as one from another class—or an old one from the same class. By the time your teacher notices the mistake, you will be able to complete the real homework, or just turn it in the next day and say you are sorry about the mix-up.
Copy answers from a friend so you have something to turn in. Make sure your friend is ok with helping. This also only works for assignments where it is expected that students will have the same or similar answers. In some schools, even copying something like homework can merit a suspension. Remember to evaluate the situation and make a good decision as to whether or not you will copy homework off of a peer.

, Know that in many cases, you’ll need a written excuse from a doctor or clinic to prove to your teacher that you had to seek medical care, and weren’t able to complete your homework.

,


A dangerous move, you can forge a note from a parent explaining why you couldn't do your homework.
If you decide to forge one, be warned that your teacher might know it’s a fake. If you are caught, you face punishment from both your parents and teacher.

"
"
Try being honest.,
Take responsibility for your lack of preparation.,
Think of legitimate reasons why you could not do the work.,
Remember that your teacher is busy, too.",How to Excuse Yourself from Unfinished Homework3," It’s best to simply tell the truth, and let your teacher know why you weren’t able to complete your homework. A sincere apology can go a long way.


You might say something like ""I am really sorry, but I got behind on things and wasn't able to finish my homework. Could I be excused just this once? I'll turn it in tomorrow and I won't be late again.""
Keep things simple and direct, rather than annoying your teacher with long, rambling excuses.

, Admit that you did not complete the work, and accept blame rather than putting it off on someone or something else.


This means saying something like: ""I know there's no excuse, and I accept full responsibility. I should have done my work. I'm sorry that I'm not prepared, and it won't happen again.""
Doing so will display maturity and your teacher might respect your honesty.

, You will need something more than “I forgot” to convince your teacher.


Perhaps you are overworked and stressed (this is especially persuasive at exam time).
If circumstances beyond your control, like an illness or death in the family, have prevented you from doing your work, say so.
You can also explain that you didn’t understand the assignment, or struggled with it, or felt rushed, and needed to give it more time.

, Try to say in advance that you were not able to do your homework.


Your teacher is more likely to accept the excuse if you don’t spring it on him or her at the last minute.
You might also be able to ask for an extension so that you can turn the homework in later.
Know your teacher’s personality, and how flexible and forgiving he or she is. When you talk to your teacher, look sad, serious, agitated, etc. depending on your excuse.

"
"
Give the teacher a warning.If you’re a school official and a teacher has been reported for incompetence or misconduct, giving them a warning is generally the first step.,
Provide resources to help the teacher improve.Many states will want the teacher to not only receive a warning, but also be given resources to help them improve.,
Observe the teacher in the classroom.The teacher will need to be evaluated, especially in the case of incompetency.,
Document every incident that occurs.You should have a file already created for the teacher in question.",How to Fire a Teacher2," Most states will require this, especially if the teacher has tenure. You can do this verbally, but you may want to consider giving them a written warning, depending on the severity of the misconduct report.


If the teacher is still within their probationary period (usually their first three years as employees) and haven’t attained tenure, it’s possible that they can be dismissed outright.If the teacher has tenure, terminating them becomes a lot more difficult. Unless they’ve done something lewd, immoral or criminal, they have a right to a warning and a chance to improve the bad behavior.

, If you want to make sure you’re understood, provide written documents with suggested resources and actions clearly spelled out.


Keep a copy of these documents in the teacher's file so that you can access them.
It’s highly likely you’ll be asked to prove that you provided resources and specific suggestions.

, Your school district and possibly even the state may have specific evaluation requirements, so familiarize yourself with those rules. For example, in Ohio, school officials must first schedule two 30-minute observations. During those observations, evidence needs to be gathered that supports the grounds for possible dismissal.In addition, the teacher must also be provided with written copies of very detailed plans for improvement.
Investigate your school’s criteria and follow it accordingly.

, Document everything – complaints, absences, what was found in the evaluations, and anything else that has to do with that teacher. If you’re intent on terminating the teacher, you will be asked to provide all evidence and information gathered. The more you have, the better your case is.

"
"
Present the evidence to the school board.If the teacher has been given all of the outlined allowances and failed to improve, either in performance or behavior, a proposal for their dismissal should be submitted to the school board.,
Inform the teacher about dismissal.,
Provide the teacher a chance to present their side.Teachers are protected by procedural due process, which essentially means that after the dismissal has been served and an explanation provided, they have the right to tell their side of the story.",How to Fire a Teacher3," The teacher’s file should be submitted with the proposal.


The file should include every piece of relevant information or evidence that’s been collected.
To terminate a teacher, usually one of the following must be proven: immoral conduct, incompetence, neglect of duty, substantial noncompliance with school laws, conviction of a crime, insubordination, fraud or misrepresentation., The United States Supreme Court case of Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill provided the basic standard for how this is to be done. A teacher with tenure must be given verbal or written notice of their dismissal. All of the charges against the teacher must be revealed, along with any evidence gathered.


The employer is also expected to explain the evidence and why it is grounds for dismissal., It must be made clear that they have the opportunity to do this, with the understanding that they will be heard.


In most cases, the teacher will still be dismissed."

Keep it fresh.,
Have the right face and hair.,
Wear the perfect top.,
Be prepared before you take your picture.,
Have the right expression.",How to Look Great in a Yearbook," Don't forget that your hygiene is just as important as having an amazing smile in your photo. You should take a shower and wash your face before you show those pearly whites.


If you normally shower in the evenings, try to make time for a morning shower on the day of your photo. This will make your skin look even better.
If you're not wearing makeup, wash your face before you take your photo.
Wash your hair so it's shiny instead of limp or greasy.;
, Your face and hair should be in great shape when you take your yearbook photo. You don't have to overdo it, but there are a few things you can do to make sure you look your best on the day of the photo.


Keep your hair out of your eyes. Though you may think it's ""cool"" to hide half your face under a layer of bangs or long hair, your parents won't appreciate it, and the other students will be focusing on your hair instead of your looks.
Style your hair like you normally style it. Don't try anything crazy or fancy on the day of the photo. It may not turn out right, and you won't end up looking like yourself.
Use a little gel or hair product to keep your hair fresh.
Boys should make sure their eyebrows are in place, and that if they have facial hair, that it isn't out of control.
Girls should wear light makeup if that's what they normally do. No dramatic eye-makeup or lipstick changes on the day of the photo, though.
Avoid any distractions. Girls shouldn't wear big earrings, and boys should avoid chains or hats. Keep the focus on your face, not your accessories.

, Your shirt or top will be the next thing that people notice after they see your expression, your face, and your hair, so you should get it right. The top should emphasize your best features, not distract people from your amazing looks and smile. Here's what you should wear:


A simple, solid color.
A black or dark color to make you stand out against the background.
Nothing white or yellow that may wash you out.
No shirts with logos, pictures, or witty sayings. Those will distract people from your face.
Avoid wearing anything too trendy. Your nautical-style shirt may be in this fall, but you will look ridiculous and dated years later.
If you really want the perfect photo, bring a different top of an opposite color to school just in case. If it turns out the background is sky blue and you're wearing a sky blue shirt, you'll feel happy to have your trusted black t-shirt.

, There are a few things you can do to improve your yearbook photo while you're waiting in line.


Girls should quickly run to the bathroom or take out a mirror to touch up their makeup before the photo shoot.
Bring a brush. Run it through your hair, but not so many times that it looks poofy or staticky.
Bring a mirror. Though the photographer should have one, be prepared just in case. A mirror will help you see how your hair and face looks, and will help you see if there's anything in your teeth.
If you have oily skin, use an oil-blotter to quickly get rid of the shine.
Have a positive attitude while you wait. Get pumped to take your yearbook photo, and your positive energy will show in the picture!

, You should decide on the look you'll give well in advance, so you don't try anything new on the day of the photo. Plan a natural smile that emphasizes your best features, and which actually looks like you.


If you normally show your teeth when you smile, do it for the photo.
Work on having your eyes open just the right amount. Avoid opening your eyes too much and having bug eyes, or squinting.
Don't slouch. Maintain good posture while you take your picture, and you will look better for it.
Practice your smile at home. Having a friend or relative take picture of you if you really want to practice.
Work on your angle. You should aim to look at the camera directly, or to tilt your head slightly. Don't tilt your head too much or turn to the side or you may look a bit silly. The photographer should direct you.
If the photographer gives you a few photos to choose from at the end, pick the one that looks the most natural.
Remember to be yourself! Your yearbook photo is your chance to show off who you really are — not to look like a complete stranger.

Deliver your thank you graduation speech.",How to Write a Graduation Thank You Speech," This is a great first step to take so you don't forget someone important. If you will be talking to a large audience, feel free to be vague about who you are addressing. For example, say ""I want to thank all my teachers"" rather than listing their names, and say “I want to thank my friends” rather than naming everyone. This is quicker and less likely to make some feel left out.


If you are talking to close friends or family, address the people you are thanking by name.
Write down every person or group of people that comes to mind. You can edit this later on.;
, Unless you have a very short amount of time to speak, you should expand your speech to include why you are thankful towards these individuals. Write down words or phrases about why you are thankful towards these friends, family members, coaches, professors, and so on.


Be honest about why you are thanking someone.
The reasoning here can be very simple. For example, “My history teacher always made me laugh,” or “My mom woke me up every morning” are good reasons to thank someone.
The more heartfelt the gratitude, the better.Take time to reflect on your feelings.

, Freewrite about the topic of graduation and being thankful. Jot down any thought that relates to being thankful and graduating from your school or program. You may find some interesting ideas or things you want to say that didn’t come up before.


Remember, there is no wrong way to brainstorm. Just keep writing.
Continue to freewrite until you cannot think of anything else to say, and for at least 30 minutes.
Now, you’ve brainstormed about your speech, so it is time to write it.

, The introduction of the speech should be interesting and engage the audience. Some strategies you can use are: beginning with a rhetorical question, a quote, or a short anecdote. Any strategy is fine as long as it relates to being thankful and graduating. Try to keep this to 2-5 sentences (or 2 paragraphs for a speech longer than 5 minutes). A few examples are:


“What are you thankful for?” This is beginning with a rhetorical question, since the audience will not answer.
As Willie Nelson once said, ""When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around."" This is beginning with a quote.
“It was the first day of high school, and I stood outside the door of my first class, scared to go in. On the last day of high school, I left that same door feeling thankful.” This is beginning with an anecdote.

, This is where you get to thank your friends, family, teachers, and so on in depth. Look at your brainstorming notes, and write 1-2 paragraphs where you say who you want to thank and why in complete sentences. (2-3 for a speech longer than 5 minutes). Don’t spend more than 2-3 sentences talking about a single person unless you really want to emphasize being thankful towards them.


For example, you can say, “I would like to thank my friends and family for always inspiring me when I felt hopeless.”
Another example is, “I want to thank Professor Z for helping me choose a major.”
The body of the speech comes immediately after the introduction.
Avoid insulting or offending those you are speaking to. Do not vent about problems or criticize others during this speech.

, Write 1-2 sentences (1 paragraph for a speech that is longer than 5 minutes) that summarize everything you just said. Make sure to refer back to your theme and tie everything together in these 1-2 sentences. The conclusion comes after the body of the speech, and it can be very simple. For example, you can just say “Thank you again.”


Another simple example is, “Once again, I am so lucky to have such great friends and family. Thank you.”
You can end on thanking someone by saying, “The last person I want to thank is my grandma. She was always there for me. Good night.”

, Remove grammar errors, parts of the speech that seem too long, or anything you are unsure about including.If you have time, ask a friend, family member, or teacher to read over the speech and give you feedback. When you are satisfied with what you have written, you can being to practice delivering the speech.

, You can keep this with you as you speak, but remember to look up from your notes occasionally. Print or write the speech in large print so you can clearly see the words. You may need to print out or write a clean copy of the speech after you edit it more.

, Begin a timer when you begin reading, and see how long it takes you to read the entire speech. You may have an assigned time limit, such as 3-5 minutes; if you are giving a speech informally, decide on a time limit. Stop the timer when you are done reading.

, Begin to remove parts of the speech, shorten sentences, and make more concise statements if your speech is too long. Once you edit out a sentence or idea, read the speech again to see if it is short enough. Continue this until you can read the speech well within the time limit.

, Continue to time yourself so you do not speak for an excessive amount of time. As you familiarize yourself with your speech, your delivery will speed up.

, This includes smiling often, making eye contact, and not fidgeting. Breathe as you talk, and avoid saying “Um” or “Uh” too often. Practicing in front of a mirror, a video recorder, or a friend is a good way to see if you have nervous body language.

, Remember to breathe, make eye contact, and smile as you are talking. Reference your notes if you get stuck, and have fun thanking those people important to you.

Come to class prepared and ready to pay attention.,
Keep your phone in your locker.,
Be extra polite during class.,
Hand over the item if you broke a rule with it.,
Ask for any items your teacher took immediately after class.,
Take action if a teacher only ever takes your things.",How to Deal With Teachers That Take Your Personal Items Away1," Show up to class ready to learn. During class make sure to sit up, face forward, and always listen when your teacher is talking. Furthermore, have everything you’ll need when you arrive to class, including your completed homework and everything you need to take notes or work on class materials.Always do your best on in-class assignments. Even if you’re struggling in a certain class, your teacher will be happy to see you making an effort.;
, Don’t use your phone at all when you’re in class. In fact, many schools explicitly allow teachers to take phone away from students who are using them during class. If you must bring your phone to class, make sure it is off or on silent and stored out of sight in a backpack or underneath your desk.Recognize that using your phone during class is disrespectful to your teacher, your fellow classmates, and even yourself, as you’re making it less likely that you and your classmates are fully focusing on the lesson.

, Some teachers are particularly sensitive about students’ behavior during their class. Be especially polite in classes taught by a teacher that gets irritated easily - these are probably the teachers that are most likely to go on a tirade about the lack of manners among today’s youth and start taking everybody’s stuff.Try to raise your hand and ask a question at least once per class, to show that you’re engaged in the lesson and that you value your teacher’s contribution to your education.

, Recognize that most teachers are not looking to get their students in trouble. It is simply their job to ensure that you and your classmates are able to learn, free from danger or distraction. For instance, if you were caught texting in class, understand that the teacher can fairly ask to take your phone and will simply put it somewhere safe, but out of your reach.Do not argue with your teachers in front of your classmates.
Apologize for distracting the class and hand them the item.
Ask for the item back after class. The more mature you were when they asked for it, the easier it will be to get it back.

, If you had been texting or otherwise breaking a rule, apologize and promise not to do so again. Be polite, as you do not want to get in further trouble, and you want your teacher to give you your item back without further conflict.


Try something like: “I apologize for allowing myself to get distracted during class. I’ll bring my phone to my locker and leave it there the rest of the day.”
If they say they’re going to keep it for the rest of the day, return after school and ask again.
If you phone is taken and not returned at the end of the day, tell a teacher you trust or a parent or guardian.

, You may need to talk to another school employee if a teacher is treating you unfairly. If your teacher only ever takes your stuff, or threatens to do so but does not make similar threats to other students, recognize that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Ideally, talk directly to the teacher about why you are being treated differently by asking whether you have been behaving inappropriately during class.If you feel uncomfortable having this type of conversation with the teacher, or try to do so and it does not go well, meet with the principal or a teacher you trust to talk about it.

A teacher can help you manage your stress and may be able to give you some leeway on homework at times.Before approaching a teacher, think about how much you're willing to share. You do not have to share all the details, but a basic overview can help. You can also think about what your teacher could potentially do to help.
A personal problem can sometimes get in the way of school work. A teacher can help you manage your stress and may be able to give you some leeway on homework at times.;
, An academic problem may also require help from a teacher. If you're struggling with a subject, make sure your teacher knows how much you're trying. They will be more sympathetic if they know you want to learn.Think about any particular reasons you may be struggling. Write down all the reasons you don't understand the topic. Make it clear you're willing to learn, but are struggling to do so.
When you approach your teacher, tell them exactly what you don't understand. Ask your teacher if he or she can give you some one-on-one attention.

, Not all teachers will be sympathetic. If you're going through a personal problem, pick a sympathetic teacher to discuss this with.Think about the teachers you feel comfortable around. Is there a teacher who's very friendly and approachable? Are you particularly close to one teacher in your school?
If your math teacher tends to be cold, do not talk to him or her. Instead, talk to your history teacher, who has always been warm and caring.

, Some issues are time sensitive. You want to talk these over before it's too late. If a personal issue is affecting your grades, for example, make sure to talk to your teacher before the marking period ends., Teachers are busy people. They may not have time to talk to you after class or between classes. It's best to make an appointment.Some teachers have office hours. If teachers at your school have office hours, stop by then to talk.
If your teacher does not have office hours, stop your teacher after class. Say something like, ""I have something I want to talk over with you. Is there a time we could meet in private?""

, Stay calm going into the situation. Remember, most teachers care about their students and want to see them succeed. If you're struggling with a personal issue, your teacher will want to help you.Introduce the topic. You do not want to waste time making small talk. You should start discussing your problem right away.
For example, say something like, ""I'm having a problem at home. I really need someone to listen and I didn't know who else to talk to.""
If you do not want other people to know, say something like, ""Can this stay between us?"" before you begin the talk. Keep in mind, however, your teacher may be legally obligated to report a situation if you are in danger.

, You want to make sure your teacher understands exactly what the issue is. When trying to get your teacher's sympathy, explain using as many specifics as possible. Say what the problem is, and how it's affecting your performance in school.If it's a personal problem, try something like, ""My dad has been very sick with cancer lately, and sometimes I can't sleep. That's why I've been running late for class a lot. I'm also worried about the upcoming book report, because it's due the weekend I told him I would go to chemo with him.""
If it's an academic problem, talk about what exactly you're struggling with. Don't say this topic is ""too hard"" or your grade was ""unfair."" Instead, try something like, ""I don't understand what you meant by this comment on my paper. I want to do better next time, but I just feel like I'm missing something. Can you explain more?""

, You do not want to come off as whiny or hostile when talking to your teacher. Make sure to be respectful, even if your teacher is not immediately sympathetic to your issue.Keep your negative emotions in check. If your teacher does not seem immediately sympathetic, he or she may not understand yet. Stay calm, and keep trying to explain.
Do not rush to judgments. For example, your teacher says, ""Well, I can't just give you an extension. It wouldn't be fair to other students."" Wait before you react. Your teacher may have something else to say. He may continue with something like, ""But I understand your dad's sickness must be tough. I can give you time in class to work while students do other activities.""

, You want the conversation to be productive. If you do gain your teacher's sympathy, think about why you need it. What do you hope to gain by having your teacher by sympathetic to your situation?You may just want your teacher to understand. If a personal problem is, say, affecting your behavior, you may just want the teacher to know. Say something like, ""I just wanted to explain so you don't think I'm not paying attention in class.""
You may want or need some special considerations, however. If you've, say, recently been diagnosed with dyslexia, you may need your teacher to be sympathetic to the fact you'll need more time for tests and quizzes. Say something like, ""Is there any way I can get an extra 20 minutes to complete tomorrow's quiz?""

, Thank your teacher for his or her time. Make sure you both know the game plan going forward in regards to your classroom responsibilities. Reiterate what plans, if any, were made. Then, say something like, ""I just wanted to thank you very much for listening"" before leaving the classroom., Teachers tend to be drawn to students who like being taught. If you want your teacher to like you, try to genuinely enjoy school. Paying attention in class, engaging with discussion, and coming in with enthusiasm can all help.Remember the benefits of an education. School prepares you for the real world and can help you get into a good college after graduation. Think of school as a way to help your future and learn new things.
Focus on the classes you like. While you may dread history class each day, see it as a necessary evil to get to math class. Try to develop some interest in history anyway. Think about how interesting it is to learn about the events that shaped the current current world.

, This will help you seem responsible to your teacher. Bring all the materials you need to class. It can help to have a different folder for different classes, that include things like assignments, and assignment sheets. Be sure to never forget your textbook, or things like a calculator.Make sure you study as well. Do your reading carefully and review materials after class. This way, you'll be able to follow class better and come in with great questions.

, Teachers hate students who do not listen in class. In class, avoid distractions. Keep things like books, your phone, and other electronic devices out of reach. Listen to everything your teacher says.Take notes. This will help you follow along better, and it will also make you look like a better student.

, Never be late on assignments. If you need sympathy due to a personal problem, your teacher is vastly more likely to provide it if you've never had issues with late papers before. Always stay turn your homework in on time."

Familiarize yourself with your school’s rules.,
Defend yourself when you haven’t broken any rules or a teacher is being unfair.,
Notify another adult immediately if a teacher behaves inappropriately.",How to Deal With Teachers That Take Your Personal Items Away2," Read through your school’s student handbook if you’re curious about what you’re allowed to bring to have at school. Knowing the rules will also help you deal with a teacher that has threatened to take something away from you.


Stated most simply: the easiest way to avoid having a teacher take your things away is to avoid breaking the rules that may cause them to do so!

, In the event a teacher may have done or threatened something without your breaking any rules, point out that you haven’t broken any rules. This will only work if you know the rules.Alternatively, if you broke a minor rule that does not warrant they take your item, you can calmly point this out and say something like, “I’m sorry for the distraction, I’ll put this away right now and it won’t be an issue again.”
If you refuse to give up a possession, know that your teacher cannot forcibly take anything from you. However, refusal to turn in an item with which you were breaking a rule may lead to further punishment down the line.

, You must obey the rules when you’re at school. A teacher must also enforce the school’s rules. However, if a teacher ever does anything that you believe they may not be allowed to do, tell someone right away.Your teacher’s actions must also follow the school’s rules, and must be based on safety and education.
A teacher can never use force against you or another student.
A teacher cannot break any of your possessions.
If a school official does not respond to your claims, ask to call a parent or guardian immediately.
If the school does not allow you to make a call, tell an adult you trust – whether another teacher or a parent or guardian – everything that occurred as soon as possible.
Talk to an older sibling or an adult family member if you’re unsure about how something that happened and don’t know whether you should tell others.

Prove you didn’t do anything wrong.,
Don’t keep anything that’s not allowed at school in your locker.,
Keep large amounts of cash at home.",How to Deal With Teachers That Take Your Personal Items Away3," Keep in mind that if you can prove that you are not guilty of something, it is likely worth showing your teacher the proof.A teacher or administrator cannot force you to consent to a search. You can always say no or ask to call your parents. However, if you have nothing to hide, consider allowing a teacher access to your possessions briefly.


School officials can only search you or your possessions if they have reasonable, individualized suspicion of your involvement in breaking a rule. They may also conduct a search if you voluntarily consent to their doing so.
Reasons for reasonable suspicion include a school employee overhearing something, or seeing or smelling something directly.
Suspicion that warrants a search must also be specific to you. For instance, if your friend has gotten into trouble and they want to search your possessions as well, they cannot search your belongings unless there is specific evidence that incriminates you.

, Know that lockers are usually considered school property. Accordingly, schools can search your locker at any time with or without any sort of suspicion.If your cell phone or computer are in your locker, they cannot be searched without reasonable, individualized suspicion, your consent, or a warrant.

, Having large amounts of cash with you may make teachers or other school employees curious or concerned about why you have it. Try to plan purchases that may require a large amount of cash outside of school so as not to put you or your teachers in an uncomfortable situation.


Plan large purchases for the weekend, and have a parent accompany you when handling large amounts of cash.
If you do need to bring a large amount of cash to school for an after-school purchase, keep it somewhere locked up and don’t tell anyone about it. Be ready to tell a teacher or administrator why you have a large amount of cash at school.
For instance, if you intend to buy a bike from a friend after school, be honest and tell your teacher the specifics of the arrangement.

Get help if you believe your rights have been violated.,
Know that a teacher usually cannot search the content on your phone.,
Know that laptops are more likely to be legally searched.,
Recognize the legal differences regarding searches of your own property and your school’s property.,
Deal with law enforcement appropriately.",How to Deal With Teachers That Take Your Personal Items Away4," Contact the American Civil Liberties Union to discuss a potential violation of your rights and any legal action that may be appropriate.More commonly, the ACLU can work with your school to ensure the rights of students are not violated without resorting to legal action.


Write down everything that happened during any situation where you believe your rights may have been violated.
Include when incidents occurred, who was involved, and who was around.
Include specifics, such as everything that was said and by whom, as well as anything that you were asked or made to do.

, If your school does not allow cell phones, then a school employee can take your phone, maybe even until the end of the day. However, if you were simply texting or talking on your phone in a context that was not allowed by the school, they cannot look at any of the contents on your phone.If a teacher or administrator asks for your permission, you do not have to allow them to search your phone.
A cell phone search is only legal if there is reasonable suspicion of your personal involvement in breaking a specific rule at the school. Even then, a school employee can only look at what is necessary to confirm or the dispel the suspicion.
It is illegal for a school employee to use your phone to call or text other students while posing as you.

, If you are not allowed to bring laptops to school and do so, they are likely allowed to take it until the end of the day. Whether or not they are allowed to search a personal laptop that you are not allowed to have at school is more of a legal grey area that is undetermined in most places.If your school allows laptops, a teacher may only search it for reasonable suspicion of your wrongdoing.
Files unrelated to something they may have the right to look for cannot be copied, or even viewed.
For instance, if you have been accused of sending threatening emails, the school has the right to ensure that this is not occurring. However, they may not look at photos on your personal laptop while investigating the charge, as photos are not relevant to the accusation.

, A school employee can take a school-owned laptop from you for any reason whatsoever. They can also legally search the laptop’s contents.Similarly, you may be required to give a teacher your password to a school-sponsored email account.
If a teacher demands you give them the password to a personal email account or device unaffiliated with the school, you do not have to give it to them.
To ensure your privacy, store and send personal messages from personal devices while you’re not at school.

, If a police officer - sometimes referred to as a School Resource Officer – asks to search you or your possessions, know that laws regarding your rights are slightly different. Essentially, law enforcement officers need a warrant or your consent to conduct a search.Still, you should always be polite when speaking with an officer, if only to limit the time you have to interact with them.


Calmly ask an officer who wants to search you or your personal belongings – including a phone or computer – whether they have a warrant.
Ask if you are free to leave. You will likely be able to do so, unless the officer has evidence or reasonable suspicion that you have committed or intend to commit a crime.
Tell the officer you would like your parent or a lawyer to be present if they begin to ask you questions you do not want to answer.
If a search is conducted without your consent, clearly state that you do not consent by saying, “I do not consent to a search of my property.”
If you do not know what to do or say, know that you always have the right to remain silent.

Move tassels from right to left in a traditional ceremony.,
Check the school code.,
Consider the photography.,
Choose from special tassels.,
Add the honor cord.,
Keep the cap flat.,
Remove the cap when instructed.,
Follow the school dress code.",How to Wear Your Tassel for a High School Graduation," In most traditional graduation ceremonies, all students begin with their tassel on the right side of the cap.After the student receives a diploma, he or she moves the tassel onto the left side.


Many schools ask the students to move the tassels in unison, so everyone shares in the moment. In other ceremonies, each student moves his own tassel after accepting the diploma. Ask a teacher if you are not sure which tradition your school follows.;
, The tassel tradition began in universities, and has not spread to all high schools. Ask the front desk for commencement information, or find the person arranging the ceremony and ask about tassels. Your school may have its own tradition, or may not have guidelines at all.

, Most schools photograph the student at the moment he or she accepts the diploma. For the best photograph, keep the tassel on the opposite side of the photographer. This prevents the tassel obscuring your face., Although this tradition is more common in universities, some high schools may allow special tassels. These might signify membership in an honors society, valedictorian status, or other achievements. If your school allows these, and you are eligible for more than one tassel, just choose one.Unless specifically told that you can pick your own tassel, stick with the default recommended by the school.

, Honor cords are common at high schools to show special achievements. If your school has given you permission to wear an honor cord, drape this around your neck, with the two sides hanging evenly in front of your shoulders. Leave this in place for the entire ceremony.

, Adjust the cap so the mortarboard lies flat. This ensures a more even appearance and prevents the tassel from sliding.

, Traditionally, men remove their caps during the national anthem and/or the school song. Women may remove the cap or leave it on.After the song is finished, replace the cap, making sure the tassel is in the same position it was before.

, At most high schools, you may be asked to wear dark clothing under your gown, and to avoid casual clothing such as jeans and sweatshirts.For exact requirements, ask a teacher or staff member.


Some high schools will allow you to decorate the top of your mortarboard. Make sure you stay within the provided guidelines, or the school may remove the cap.

Arrange the cap so that the point is in front.,
Make sure the cap sits evenly.,
Attach the tassel.,
Position the tassel correctly.,
Leave your cap on for the duration of the ceremony.",How to Wear a Graduation Cap1," The mortarboard (the square piece on the crown of the cap) is meant to be worn offset in a diamond shape. The front and back of the cap will usually be indicated by the design of the headpiece—look for the slight taper in the forehead area and the elastic band in the rear.Situate the cap so that the front corner of the mortarboard is centered on your forehead.If you’re still not sure which way it goes, take a look inside the brim. The manufacturer often includes basic directions for how to wear the cap properly.;
, Once the cap is on your head, the mortarboard should be flat and level with the ground. If it’s not, you may need to tilt it slightly to straighten it out. Double check that the band of the headpiece is symmetrical and comes to a stop about an inch above your eyebrows.Don’t push the cap too far forward or back on your head or let it lean to one side.To test whether your cap is level, try placing a lightweight object on top and see if it stays in place., If the cap doesn’t have a fixed tassel, or it doesn’t arrive preassembled, you’ll need to put it on yourself. To do this, simply loop the circular end of the tassel over the raised button in the center of the mortarboard. It should be able to slide freely around the button without coming loose.Give the tassel a couple gentle tugs to make sure it’s secure.

, At the beginning of the ceremony, the tassel should fall on the right side of the cap (unless otherwise specified). Once everyone in the class has been announced, you and your fellow grads will flip it around to the left side, signifying your transition from student to graduate.Some schools and programs may do things a little differently. Be sure that you’re clear about your school’s established practices prior to the big day.
Keep the tassel out of your line of sight and resist the urge to mess with it as much as possible.

, Once you've got your cap and gown on, try not to fidget with them too much. They may not be the most comfortable, but you'll only have to wear them for a couple of hours.When it comes time to remove your cap, do it in style—new graduates traditionally toss their caps into the air as a celebratory gesture when the ceremony draws to a close.


Resist the urge to remove your cap for any reason once the ceremony is underway, unless it's for the singing of the National Anthem.You can hold onto your cap if you'd rather be wearing it when it comes time to take pictures. In fact, this will definitely be a good idea if your regalia is rented!

Order your cap and gown in the right size.,
Give the cap a trial run.,
Style your hair to fit under the cap.,
Save the cap for last.,
Decorate your cap.",How to Wear a Graduation Cap2," Use the size measurements provided by the supplier to ensure that your graduation regalia will fit the way it’s supposed to. The cap itself should be snug, but not too tight. If it keeps slipping out of place, it’s most likely too big, whereas if it’s cutting off your circulation you might benefit from going up a size.Get a more accurate estimate by measuring your crown with a tape measure and comparing that measurement to the available sizing options.Return poorly-fitting caps and gowns right away to give yourself plenty of time to have them exchanged for the correct size.

, It’s a good idea to try your cap and gown on a time or two before the actual ceremony so you can get an idea of how the completed ensemble will look together. This will also give you a chance to make any necessary last minute adjustments.The more times you wear the cap, the more comfortable you’ll feel once it’s time to take to the stage.

, Most guys and ladies with shorter hair will be able to get away with minimal styling. Those with longer locks can experiment with ponytails, braids or straightened looks that draw the eye to the neck and shoulders. The key is to keep the hair smoothed away from the crown to give the cap the space it needs to rest comfortably.If you’d prefer to show off a more elegant style, try curling the ends or tucking it up so that it’s just visible beneath the cap.It’s typically wise to avoid up-dos and styles with too much volume.

, Wait until you’re wearing your gown, stole and any other components to put on the cap. That way, you can focus your attention on fixing your hair and makeup without worrying about messing them up later. The cap should be the final addition to your graduation regalia.Some gowns and hoods are designed to be slipped over your head, which can be tricky if you’ve already got your cap on.

, Some schools may allow you to add small embellishments to your graduation cap to express your personality and help you stand out from the crowd. Tack on a few buttons or a pendant for a modest injection of personality, or break out the paint pens, glitter and fabric letters to really make a statement. This is an important day in your life, so it's important that you enjoy yourself while you're receiving your honors.Use paint, fabric and other accessories in your school's colors.
Spell out a special message or quote related to graduation. Even if your classmates can't see it, the audience will.Be sure to run your decorating ideas by the principal or dean before you making any drastic modifications to your regalia.

"
"
Put the cap away until you need it.,
Brush out the tassel.,
Keep your cap spotless.",How to Wear a Graduation Cap3," The best way to protect your graduation cap from damage is to not take it out any more often than you have to. Stash the cap in the box it was packaged in when it’s not in use and set it on the top shelf of a closet where it won’t get crushed or bent. This will keep it from being exposed to dust, sunlight and moisture, as well as other potential dangers like pets or small children.


Handle the mortarboard carefully. Always grip it lightly by the edges whenever you’re picking it up or setting it down.
As soon as you receive your cap and gown, place them on a hanger to work out the wrinkles., As your cap gets moved around, the strands of the tassel may get hung up on one another. Run your fingers through the strands before putting on the cap to separate them and keep them looking neat and orderly.This should be done just before you put the cap on so you can walk down the aisle confident and tangle-free.

, There will probably be no need to clean your cap prior to graduation, but if for some reason you must, do it with a gentle steaming or ironing. Never put the cap through the washing machine, have it dry cleaned or allow it to get wet, as this can easily ruin the fabric or cause it to lose its shape.Brush loose dust and dirt from your cap and gown by hand rather than using an implement that may damage the material.
Don’t leave your cap sitting out where it may get something spilled on it.

Remember to write your speech that might appeal to the different groups of people who will be listening to your speech.

For example, David Foster Wallace's speech he chose to talk about not getting involved in the rat race but deciding to ignore the pressure of the world that tells you you must make lots of money and buy lots of things. Even though this speech is for the students, anyone can relate to the rat race and high expectations from the world to succeed to make lots of money just to spend it all.
Write down a list of the different groups of students you might want to consider: honors students, athletes, students who know what they are doing after graduation, students who do not know what they are doing, etc. Make sure in your speech that you aren't assuming that all the students in attendance are attending college, if that is note the case.

For example, perhaps they dedicated a lot of time and effort as a class when they decorated a float that won a prize in a parade. You could consider incorporating that piece of information into your speech, like ¨It took me a lot of persistence and grit to get through that final term paper. However, it wasn't nearly as much work, or as much fun, as decorating that float with this class the night before the parade.¨

Avoid cliches.",How to Write a Graduation Speech2," Get out a pad and pencil, or use your computer to open a new document and start brainstorming ideas. Writing this speech is going to be a process and brainstorming is an important part of that process. Additionally, it is helpful to verbally brainstorm with your family and friends about what to write. However, once you start the writing process, it is a much more effective to brainstorm through writing. Once you have ideas from talking to your friends or family or thinking about what you want to say start writing down experiences that match those ideas.
For example, if you were driving toward the theme that David Foster Wallace used of learning how to think instead of what to think. You might have brainstorm about a time that you decided to learn how to knit to make all of your friends and family gifts for Christmas instead of buying them gifts. Talk about how much your grandmother loved the scarf you made her and how that ended up bonding you two together. When you think back to why you care so much about making gifts instead of buying them you realize that you want to question the pressure that is put on you to spend a lot of money to buy everyone Christmas presents. That is your theme.

, Think about what you want your message to your audience to be, and write it down in one sentence. If you know what your message is, you will be able to write a more effective speech. Starting from your main idea and developing a speech from there will save you a lot of time and rewriting.


For example, I want to talk about how giving your time to volunteer work will end up making you a happier and healthier person.
Write out your most important life experiences and lessons learned, and decide what a main take away from those stories/lessons could be. For example, after working at the soup kitchen every weekend during my senior year, I learned life lessons from people I never expected to learn from. Homeless people who I saw freely give others some of their prized possessions ended up teaching me how to give freely.
Some examples of common themes in graduation speeches are: believing in/liking yourself, taking risks/putting yourself out there, failing is necessary for success, giving back helps you as an individual, being persistent pays off, being okay with not being perfect, overcoming adversity, good friendships save, and there are different paths to take through life/there is no one right answer. Giving thanks and congratulations is another style of graduation speech you can choose to write. In these graduation speeches individuals talk about all that they have come through as a class to get to graduation. They also might take more time to talk about and thank the individuals who helped them along the way.
These speeches tend to be less focused on giving advice and the individual giving the speech and more focused on the group as a whole. Listed here is a wikiHow article on writing a graduation thank you speech. , If you are having a hard time getting started, research good graduation speeches and start taking notes on the way they show their main ideas. Do not become intimidated by these great speeches, instead let them inspire you to write about something you really care about.


See if you can pick out a few main themes in the graduation speech, usually it will not be very difficult to find because it will be repeated several times. Writing those down will help you see how they craft their speech around those ideas.
For example, you could take note that David Foster Wallace uses a simple metaphor to get across his main idea. He uses the metaphor of a fish being aware that he is in water as compared to a person who realizes that he is in a society that influences us to think and act. This metaphor shows us how important it is to be aware of the obvious realities of being in society that others might miss. It also how shows us how isolating it can be to be aware. #*Likewise, think about using a similar convention, for example, a short joke or a metaphor that illustrates your main point.

, Below are a few common graduation speech structures that have have been used with success many times. Consider using any of the following speech structures that have been used successfully by many others. In the first speech structure, you highlight a few, typically one to four, main take-aways, or themes. You show address those ideas through personal anecdotes or nonfiction stories to impart some wisdom to the graduating class. The people who choose this structure generally feel that they have simple, yet important wisdom that might help the graduates succeed in life. For example, Steve Jobs used this structure and told just three stories about his life. The first story he told was about how he “connected the dots” in his life. In the second structure, make a list of five to ten tips that you have acquired that you give as advice to the graduating class. If you had trouble honing in on one to three themes or take-aways, this might be a good option for you. You can highlight important things that are both big and small in this kind of speech. For example, an admiral gave a speech about the ten essential life tips he learned from the Navy that including tips to both make your bed, and never, ever give up. In the third, you tell a condensed version of your life story. Go for this option if you feel like you have a very powerful personal story that illustrates some important ideas about how to be successful or how to overcome adversity. You don’t have to start with the beginning of your life, instead talk about the important things that have made you who you are. For example, music producer Jimmy Iovine used this structure and started his speech by talking about a rebuke John Landau gave him. Jon said, ¨this is not about you¨, and that advise gave Jimmy the courage to keep working when his ego was fed up. In the last speech structure, you develop one main idea as an argument and use observations from life, your personal history, etc., to support this main idea. This option is good if you are really passionate about conveying one central idea to your audience that you are entirely convinced needs to be be heard by everyone. This is perhaps the most difficult speech to write because it is much like writing an argument; your ideas need to be logical and well organized. For example, David Foster Wallace follows this structure. He makes a claim that the real value of education isn’t learning what to think but gaining the freedom to choose how to think. He stays with this theme and develops his ideas like an argument. , This means that the way you write or tell stories matches your style. Showing your personality will help your audience relate to you and will help you feel more like yourself while giving the speech.


You can use humor to convey your personality. For example, Sumner Redstone, giving a speech to DeVry University, starts his speech with some self-deprecating humor that points out that people won't enjoy sitting through his speech. Redstone says that he is glad to go first in the program, and he quotes Mark Twain who recommends swallowing a frog at the start of the day to get the worst thing out of the way. Here Redstone makes himself the toad to make his audience laugh.

, Believing in what you are saying is essential to giving a good speech, don’t be afraid of writing a simple speech so long as you believe what you are saying. For example, Joan Didonato wrote her speech about ¨four little observations¨, and her first observation was as simple as ¨commit to the journey¨. Being passionate about what you are talking about will show in your delivery, as long as you practice. Speeches involve much more than the words you say, and oftentimes much more can be said through the emotions you convey when you deliver your speech. Think about all of the ways you can put emotion into a simple phrase like ¨I would die for you."" A lot of meaning balances on the way you say those words.
Practice putting emotion into your speech to give it meaning. Rehearse what you will say in front of a mirror several times to see how you look, and don't be afraid to use gestures.

, This is a graduation ceremony, and everyone will be excited to be graduating. Depending on the tone of your speech, you can use this excitement to your advantage by throwing in references that the audience will cheer for.


Because everyone has gone through a lot to get to this point, you may want to take a minute to genuinely congratulate them on their accomplishments.

, Cliches may be true but they are also probably uninteresting to your audience. There are many graduation speech cliches: the future is yours, today is your day, discussing unemployment rates, and talking about how much the world has changed because of globalization and technology.


You should avoid these cliches because they have been overused, and the people in your audience will most likely not be inspired by these topics. Do not confuse universal themes for cliches. Some of the best, most powerful speeches have very simple messages. For example, giving back helps you grow as an individual. Even though this theme that has been explored before and will be explored again, the theme still rings true and bears repeating.

After your speech you want people to be able to easily remember what you talked about so they can discuss what you said.

, Choose someone who you trust and respect, like a teacher or colleague, who is knowledgeable about writing or speech making. Often you will be unable to see problems in your speech, but a knowledgeable person who gives you honest feedback will help you sort out those problems.


Send the same person your revisions each time you make a major edit.

, Depending on how practiced you are at talking in front of big groups of people, you may need to plan on practicing more times. Get your family or friends together to listen to your speech, and go through the speech several times in front of them.


Make sure to practice your pacing, and slow down if you have a tendency to read quickly through your speech. Use a timer when you practice giving your speech in front a mirror or your family/friends.
Practice enough times so that you have the things you want to say internalized. This means that when you go into autopilot mode in front of an audience you will be more likely to remember because of your muscle memory.

You could talk about your first day of school together and how you have all changed over the years. For example, you could talk about lifelong friendships that were made, and lessons that were learned.


Encourage your classmates to always remember and cherish the good times you had together.

, Did your class go on any big trips together? Were there any notable athletic or academic achievements? Did your class participate in a successful fundraising drive, or plan a major school event together? Try to think of a few memorable events that you could highlight. Tell a short story about one of these experiences.

Be sure to choose a story that brings the entire class together.
For instance, you could say “During the fall charity drive, our class made history by raising over three thousand dollars.”

, After you have reflected on your time together in middle school, you could talk about how these experiences have prepared you and your classmates for the future. Mention your nervousness about entering high school and meeting new people.

This includes peers, teachers, parents, administrators, and staff.Say something like: ""I want to thank the teachers, staff, Principal Nolan, and, of course, my parents for a wonderful Lemon Valley experience. Without your support and guidance we would not be where we are today.""
You could add: “I would especially like to thank my classmates for making middle school one of the most fun and rewarding experiences of my life.""

, The conclusion can be one of the hardest parts to write. You want to leave the audience with something meaningful. For example, you could end by wishing your classmates the best of luck in high school. Alternatively, you could choose to end with an inspirational quote.

, As the valedictorian you are representing your entire class in the speech, not just your own experience. Avoid speaking in the first person as much as possible and try to share stories that are relevant to the entire graduating class.

For example, you should say “We will always remember when Mr. C. made a perfect dunk on the basketball court” instead of “I will always remember when Mr. C. made a perfect dunk of the basketball court.”

, You can elevate your graduation speech by adding in a few jokes to lighten the mood. For instance, you could poke fun at one of the teachers or tell a funny story that happened during class. Do not add too many jokes to your speech. You want to try and create a balance between funny and serious.

, Although it is important to thank your teachers and peers, you should avoid talking too much about individual people. For example, you may cause certain people to feel left out if you spend too much time talking about a few individuals.That being said, it is okay to give a tribute to someone if they deserve special recognition. For example, perhaps the entire graduating class had the same teacher. In this instance, you can mention that teacher individually.

, People do not want to sit and listen to a thirty minute graduation speech. They will likely lose focus and only remember a few key stories anyways. The best graduation speeches are short and to the point. Keep your speech somewhere between ten and fifteen minutes., Motivational quotes can help to give extra meaning to your words. They can also be used to help inspire your classmates. Search online for motivational quotes and choose one that is relatable to some experience or theme that you are building your speech around.Alternatively, you could choose a quote that was hung on your classroom wall and talk about how you can apply this quote to future successes.

, You can elevate your speech by adding a bit of wisdom or advice for your friends to take with them as they enter high school. The advice you give can be funny or serious, but it must be sincere.For example, you could quote a piece of advice from a celebrity commencement speech.
Alternatively, you could say something serious like ""The journey ahead may not be easy, and most of us will stumble at some point. The important thing is that we get back up and keep working towards our goals and dreams.""

, Make sure that you say your speech out loud at least five to ten times. Practicing will help you remember the speech, make you comfortable saying the words, and ease some of your nerves. You can also try practicing in front of your family. This will get you comfortable talking in front of a group of people., On the day of your graduation you will likely be nervous and talk faster than in rehearsal. The slower you practice the easier it will be to control your speed while giving the speech. Time yourself when you practice so that you have a general idea of how long it should take when you are speaking at a slow pace., While you are delivering your speech, your mouth will likely become dry as a result of your nerves. Make sure to drink a glass of water before you deliver your speech.

Instead, you should make eye contact with the audience. This will make your speech more engaging and entertaining for members of the audience.

Make sure that you genuinely believe the words that you are saying, this way people are more apt to pay attention and listen to the speech. If you stumble on a few words, that is okay. Just repeat what you said and keep going."
"
Make sure you address everyone in the audience.,
Address specific people.,
Go slow.",How to Start a Graduation Speech2," Don’t just start going straight into the meat of your speech. People expect a small preamble, and it’s good to get your voice working first anyways. Address the crowd and say good morning, good afternoon, whatever it may be. For example, say something like ""Good morning/afternoon/night to the faculty, our trustees, and of course my classmates""

, It’s probably a good idea to address the head of the school by name. You could also address your parents, or maybe a specific teacher as a joke, or someone who helped you write the speech. This is always a good way to start a speech and it helps you warm up as you get into it.


For example ""I'd like to thank my Grandparents for traveling all the way down from Alaska to be here today.""

, Remember, you’re just getting started. You’ll definitely be nervous, and nerves inevitably will cause you to speak faster than you think you are. Consciously slow yourself down. Take pauses, observe the crowd. Even though it might be terrifying, understand that everyone is on your side. This is a once in a lifetime moment, but there’s no pressure! Appreciate the experience for what it is. Don’t rush.


Rushing will make your speech harder to understand and sound worse. Pauses can make a good speech sound great, speeding up can make a good speech sound awful.

Thank the school.,
Thank your classmates.,
Thank your parents.",How to Start a Graduation Speech3," Generally you want to end your speech with a message, rather than saying thank you. It’s not like a movie where the credits roll at the end. Try to think who is important to you and whom you owe. Who put you in the position to make this speech at all?

, The school is giving you the opportunity to address the whole student body, the teachers, and maybe even the board of trustees. It’s appropriate and recommended to thank your school for giving you this platform.


For example, ""I'd like to thank our school for always making sure that we were prepared for the next step, and refusing to let us fall through the cracks""

, These are your peers, and they’ll be listening and supporting you. Thank them for their friendship and their role in your school experience. They will appreciate it. , Of course! Your parents have undoubtedly given you an enormous amount of support over your life. This is one small way in which you can help express your gratitude. You don’t have to be long winded about it, just thank them for their help.


For example, say ""Thank you to my parents for being so supportive of my academic and extracurricular pursuits throughout the years. You always made it very easy to succeed.""

Start with your favorite quote.,
Think about what you enjoyed most about your school.,
Think about what you will miss about the school.,
Start with humor.,
Use your own voice.,
Start by talking about the differences at the school from the time you got there until the time you left.,
Give advice.",How to Start a Graduation Speech4," It changes the mood in the room and gives people an idea of what you will be talking about. You can make it a very inspirational quote, or something that you think is funny. Try to choose something relevant to your speech. This is a classic way to start a speech, but that doesn’t mean it's a bad way.

, Whether it was a field trip, funny moment, or little detail that you remember, be sure to include it into the speech. Talking about a specific memory is a great way to help people center on your speech. Anecdotes are great ways to start a speech.


For example, ""I'll always remember the way that Ryan Hoolihan spreads peanut butter on all four sides of his bread at lunch.""

, Use small details (the gravy for lunch, the color of the bathroom, etc.) that you think the school would be different without, and include them into your speech. Use these things to help illustrate other points that will come later in your speech. For example, maybe one of your teachers taught in a certain way that you found really valuable.

, Graduation is a sad day, so be sure to make it funny to lighten the mood a bit. Don't make stupid jokes, but don't be too serious. Mentioning specific people or instances by name are great ways to get laughs and get started. It’s not going to be a tough crowd.

, Don’t use difficult vocabulary just for the sake of it. You want to keep your own voice in the speech as much as possible and avoid sounding too stale. You can be formal, but don’t try to sound like an academic paper. You want people to pay attention to what you are saying. For example, ""It's been four years that we've all been to school together, and we still don't know who stole that headrest from the bus on that 9th grade field trip - but we've learned a lot of other things""

, This will help people wrap their heads around the time they spent at the college. It also will get people feeling nostalgic. , Graduation speeches don’t need to include advice, but it is a good way to start. You can use your own personal advice or advice someone has given to you. Giving advice will allow you to jump right into the rest of your speech. "

Gather your materials.,
Wrap the string around the full circumference of your head and mark it.

,
Lay the string out and measure it.,
Cut a strip of heavy duty construction paper that is equal to the circumference of your head plus two inches extra in length.,
Using the hot glue gun, glue the ends of the construction paper together.,
Cut a square of cardboard that is approximately one foot by one foot.,
Using the hot glue gun, glue the cardboard on top of the circle of construction paper so it forms a hat.

,
Voila!,
Barring any fitting adjustments that might be needed, it is now time to wrap things up and decorate the hat as you wish.,
Add your tassel if you wish.

,
Rock your graduation hat wherever you wear it - the actual ceremony or a celebration afterwards!

",How to Make Your Own Graduation Hats," (see Things You'll Need section below);
,, You now know the circumference of your head.

, You may determine the width - the greater the width the taller the hat will be.

, Remember, you allotted two extra inches in order to do this, and to fit it to your head.

, You may adjust this measurement as you wish depending on how big you want your hat to be.

,, You have completed the main structure of your hat. Check to see if it fits.

, Some ideas include painting it black or blue, or if you're allowed to have more festive attire or you'd like to personalize it, wrap it in wrapping paper and add bows, beads, etc... Let stuff hang down - make a train of ribbons. Write your name in a decorative style on the front. Make clay sculptures. You could even build structures with Popsicle sticks or toothpicks on the top. Glue small toys onto it that represent you. Paper mâché it! Make a photo collage of your life on it! You get the idea - BE CREATIVE!

Do not photograph people head on.",How to Take Graduation Portraits," Have the graduate select clothing to reflect their personality. Take pictures of the graduate wearing a few different outfits.Darker colors work better than light colors on camera. Busier patterns can also be distracting.
V-necks and swoop necks look great on camera, and a turtleneck can be flattering if the graduate has a longer face.
Try mixing and matching formal and informal outfits. The graduate can wear something like a suit or dress as well as their favorite casual top and jeans.;
, Graduation photos should capture who the graduate was during their school program. Go with their regular hair style that they wear every day. Have them avoid trying fancy new styles during the photo shoot. If they wear makeup, keep it basic. A light layer of foundation and small amounts of eye makeup and lipstick photograph best.Focus on lightening imperfections with makeup rather than applying it to their full face. Use concealer to get rid of dark spots and circles under the eyes, but do not use concealer and foundation to do a full on contoured look.

, It can be awkward to figure out what to do with your arms while taking graduation photos. Make sure the graduate does not hold their arms straight at their side, as this can look static. Instead, have them pose their arms.Have them put their arms on their hips.
Have them loosely cross their arms.
Have them place their arms in their pockets.
Have them hold their arms against something, like a wall or a fence.

, Holding your legs too stiff in a photo can look unnatural. Have the graduate bend one leg at the knee. Have them hold their legs at different lengths and angles, as this can look more natural and relaxed., Props are a big part of graduation photos. Have the graduate bring in props that showcase who they were during their school years.If they play a musical instrument, have them bring that in for photos.
If they're on a sports team, have them bring in something that showcases that. For example, have them bring in a hockey stick if they're on the hockey team.
If they're academically inclined, take pictures of them reading books.

, If you're responsible for taking photos at someone's ceremony, or are taking photos of your own before the ceremony, capture the small details of the day. This will help you remember the mood for the coming years.For example, take pictures of the graduate getting ready. Have a few photos of the graduate trying on their cap and gown.
If there are any decorations up, take pictures of these. For example, photograph the line up of congratulatory cards.
If family members are doing things like cooking, cleaning, or shopping for graduation day, get a few photos of these moments.

, Graduation ceremonies typically take place at the high school or college the graduate attended. Take some pictures of the school on graduation day.Take pictures of the school from the exterior. Get a shot of the building, as well as any signs with the name of the school.
Take pictures of any special places in the school, such as murals, trophy cases, or classrooms. You can get a picture with the graduate standing in front of such places.
If your graduate has favorite teachers or professors, try getting a picture of them with their teachers.

, If you're taking photos during the ceremony, do not hesitate to get close. Get up out of your seat before the graduate's name is going to be called. Try to get close up photos of the graduate walking on stage and accepting their diploma. If your camera has a zoom feature, use this to get a close up shot.Do not be shy about getting up close during photos. Chances are, many family members and parents are doing the same. Graduation is a special time and it's natural to want to capture it on film.

, After everyone has received their cap and gown, take some broad pictures of the class. Take photographs of the class seated in their caps and gowns. Take action shots of graduates throwing up their gowns after the ceremony. Also, take some cap and gown shots after the ceremony. Get pictures of your graduate with their friends, family members, and teachers wearing their cap and gown., After the ceremony, step back and take some picture as the graduate chats with friends, teachers, and others. Pictures of the graduate laughing, smiling, and enjoying the day will capture the mood. A solid mix of posed and candid pictures can really capture the details of graduation day., Most cameras have a white balance filter. Gymnasiums are often very bright, and it can be difficult to set the white balance properly. Get their early and take a few pictures with different white balance setting filters on your camera. See which filter gets the clearest photos so you'll get high quality shots during the ceremony., Outdoor photos are popular for graduates. However, on very bright days, the light from the outdoors can affect a picture's quality. On such days, have the graduate stand in the shade. The natural light will highlight their features without obscuring the photos.It's a good idea to take a few test shots with outdoor photos to make sure you're happy with how they turn out.

, When the ceremony is underway, make use of your camera's manual settings. You do not want to miss important moments fiddling with your camera. The camera should adjust as necessary based on things like lighting and exposure. You can focus on taking pictures alone.However, if you know your camera very well, feel free to adjust it as necessary. If you can smoothly switch the settings without too much distraction, it may make for higher quality photos.

, A downward angle is great when taking pictures in the weeks before the ceremony. A downward angle is flattering for everyone and can help slim someone's face. This works especially well for close-up photographs of a graduate's face., Photographs of someone staring directly at the camera are rarely flattering. Instead of taking close up photographs of someone's face, have someone look to one direction or another. Not only does this slim the face, it tends to look more natural."

Inquire with prospective colleges.",How to Graduate Early from High School," Graduating early is a big, important decision. Be sure to talk with your guidance counselor or principal to make sure graduating early is right for you.If you don't see or meet with your guidance counselor or principal on a regular basis, request an appointment with one of them at the main office.
To begin the conversation, explain why you'd like to graduate early and what your plans are once you do. Next, ask for their thoughts and ideas.;
, If your guidance counselor or principal is agreeable to you graduating early, ask about what classes you still need to take in order to graduate and ask for advice on how to get those classes finished within your designated time frame.Many students who have taken advanced courses throughout middle school are able to graduate after two years of high school. Students who take advanced courses for three years of high school can often skip their last year.
Your eligibility to graduate early will depend on your school and local district rules. For example, some schools require a certain number of credits for graduation while others require you to pass a graduation test. You may not be eligible to take until you've had at least 2 years of high school.

, Before you make a definite decision about graduating early, be sure to talk with your parents or guardians. In order to graduate early, you might need to attend online courses, start a homeschooling program, or enroll at a community college.These options can be difficult for some families to accommodate, so be sure to ask your parents or guardians for their help with planning.
You may also need a signature from a parent or guardian showing consent for early graduation from your high school or for enrollment into accelerated graduation programs.

, To qualify for accelerated graduation programs outside of your high school, you will likely be asked by admissions teams to provide student records for their review. You will also need to send transcript copies with college applications. Make sure you ask your high school to provide you with 3 or 4 copies of your transcripts., To gain acceptance into accelerated graduation programs (and also college), many admissions teams require letters of recommendation from your teachers, mentors, or coaches. Be sure to ask for these before you leave your current high school.


You’ll want to ask teachers, mentors, and coaches who know you well and will be able to vouch for your personal character, as well as your aptitude and performance level.
Try to get 3 or 4 letters of recommendation and make sure those who give them to you are not related to you or each other.

, Graduating early will likely require a major increase in your study and homework load. This means that you may not have as much time for work or extracurricular activities as you did in regular high school. Be sure that less work and play fits into your financial, recreation, and social goals.If you plan to get into college with a scholarship for sports or a high school club activity (like science club), be sure that you’ll still be eligible with early graduation and have time to qualify or participate with an increased study and homework schedule., Community colleges are local and provide a great stepping stone between high school and university. Many community colleges offer early graduation programs in addition to college courses that will count as both high school and college credit.Although earning college credit may not be something that helps you graduate high school early, it will allow you to graduate college early or make it easier to graduate as a double major.
Proving your aptitude at a community college while still in high school may increase your chances of getting accepted to a higher ranked university.
If commuting to a community college is difficult for you or your family, many community colleges offer online classes.

, Summer is a great time to take extra classes if your high school offers summer school programs. By enrolling in summer school for two or three summers in a row, you are likely to accumulate enough credits to graduate high school up to a year ahead of schedule.

, Some communities offer public classes on nights, weekends, and during the summer that might fulfill your high school electives needed for graduation. Be sure to check that your high school will recognize these classes for graduation before you sign up.


Enquire at your local library, community center, or town hall to find out if there are community classes available.

, Attending traditional high school takes up a lot of time that isn’t necessarily used for actual class time. For example, it takes time to switch classes, eat lunch, attend school assemblies, and work around so many other students. Attending an online high school may allow you to get more coursework done in the same amount of time you spend at regular school.You can find online high schools through an internet search. There are some online schools that allow you to attend right from your personal computer and others require you to show up at an actual building where internet access is provided., If you learn better without screen time, homeschooling is another option that might help you graduate early. The advantage of homeschooling is that you can learn at your own pace and based solely on your personal learning style, but you do need a parent, guardian, or supervisor to help manage your work and do the grading.Homeschooling can be expensive because you have to buy all the learning materials and pay for testing at independent centers to receive accredited graduation certificates.
If your parents don’t have time to help homeschool you, search online for local homeschooling groups that may allow you to join them.

, The GED is the equivalent of your high school diploma. All you need to do to obtain it is pass the test, which does require a fair bit of studying. GED study classes (both online and in person) are widely available, but they should not be taken in lieu of actual high school classes (if possible) because you could miss out on important college prep.


Getting your GED is a way to have the equivalent of a high school diploma, but the test is usually much harder than high school exams.If your plan is to attend university, check admissions guidelines. Some universities do not accept GEDs without a circumstantial explanation., Before you enroll in an early graduation program, be sure that the courses you are taking will result in an accredited high school diploma. If you’re unsure, simply ask the program’s enrollment staff. Without an accredited high school diploma, you won’t be considered a high school graduate.

, Many high schools offer college entrance exams like the SATs and the ACTs at specific times throughout the school year. They also offer important prep courses for the test. If you plan to attend university, you will need to take these tests regardless of your early graduation status.Make sure you stay up to date on when these tests are offered.
Graduating early does not necessarily improve your chances of getting into college so don’t skip the college entrance exams.

, Graduating early can be expensive if you enroll in early graduation programs that are independent of your high school. Not only do the programs cost money, but learning materials (like textbooks) and transportation (like a school bus) are not usually included. Be sure that you have the finances available to afford early graduation and any early college enrollment that might follow.

Make a list of expenses.
Talk to your parents to see if they can help you with finances.
Search online for local scholarships you might be able to apply for.
Check your eligibility for student loans.

, Some college have extra application guidelines they require prospective student to meet in order to be considered for admission. Check with the colleges you are interested in to be sure that you meet all of their early graduate criteria."

Balance your life.",How to Graduate Grade 12," When you get your list of classes, double-check to make sure that they're what you wanted, and what you can handle. Some high schools actually recommend not having a full course load and leaving yourself a spare block in grade 12 so that you're not overwhelmed. Make sure that you're not in classes that are too difficult, either. It's great to challenge yourself, but taking Advanced Math if you barely passed last year probably isn't a good idea.;
, In order to pass classes, actually being there is essential. Don't skip classes, because as boring as they might seem, they count for credits towards graduation. Also, always come to class on time so that you don't miss anything.

, Try your best not to zone out in class. Listen to what the teachers say, especially when they're teaching a new concept. Even if you're taking notes, listen to how your teacher explains the subject, as usually they explain it a bit differently out loud, and that way might make more sense to you. Take notes and highlight the information that you find important. Don't let anyone or anything (phone, iPod, etc.) distract you during class, and make sure not to distract others because they have to pay attention too.

, A lot of students are nervous to ask questions when they don't understand something, but don't be! Remember that teachers are people too, and it's their job to help you learn and understand new things. Don't be afraid to ask your teacher questions about the homework if you're unclear about it, or the new concept you're learning. Most teachers will gladly re-explain the lesson to you at lunch of after school if you're having trouble understanding it.

, Always do your homework no matter what, as it counts toward your grade. Always make sure that you understand the homework, and do it to the best of your ability. Don't just ignore it, as never doing your homework could make you fail the class and prevent you from graduating. If you're going to be away, get a friend to collect the homework and notes for you. If you know you will not be able to do your homework a night next week or something, manage your time wisely so that you can get it done the day before! School should be your highest priority; friends, video games, and social networking come second.

, Although being tutored might seem embarrassing, having a tutor will really help boost your grades. If you have a subject you struggle with, or a teacher that doesn't explain things properly, don't just struggle to figure it out on your own. Find a good tutor who can help explain things to you. It will save you the stress of not understanding a concept, and tutors can help you study for tests and do your homework too.

, Make separate folders for your subjects and keep them organized. Keep your room, bookshelf and desk clean so you do not have any trouble finding your books and notes. Keep your planner updated, or use your phone to keep track of assignments and tests.

, Learn to manage your time so that all your homework gets done without you staying up until midnight to get it done. Although it's difficult, avoid procrastinating when it comes to homework (remember that you're going to have to do it at some point, so you might as well get it over with as soon as possible). When you get home, do all of your homework first, and then use the rest of your time to check Facebook, relax, or hang out with your friends.

, Make sure that you give yourself enough time to study for tests. Study in ways that help you, such as making flash cards, a study guide, taking notes, etc. Study at least 2-5 hours a day before exams. Also make sure you go through the information you are studying at least 5 times so that it gets stuck in your long term memory. Although it's time-consuming, tests and especially exams really count towards your marks, and some universities look at your exam marks to determine whether you'll be accepted or not.

, Many high schools have a certain amount of hours that you are required to volunteer for before you can graduate. Talk to your school counsellor about how many hours you need, and ask them if they know of any places/organizations you can volunteer with. Choose a place that you're interested in; it'll make it a lot more fun, and it'll help you learn about future careers you might be interested in. For example, if you like animals, volunteer at an animal shelter or vet clinic. Make sure to start volunteering early in the year so that you don't have to cram all of your hours in in the last month of school - you'll save yourself a lot of stress.

, Many high schools have a ""credits"" system in place, in which you need to have at least a certain amount of credits to graduate. Talk to your counsellor and make sure that you're on the right track for graduation. Getting the required amount of credits is really easy as long as you pass your courses, but if you've failed some classes in the past you might be at risk of not having enough credits to graduate!

, Remember that all work and no play is bad - don't just study all the time, you should also go for a little exercise and have some fun too. Spend time with friends and forget school for a few hours. Although graduating is important, it's also important to enjoy your senior year instead of spending it with your nose in a textbook the whole time. Find a good balance between schoolwork, sports, hobbies, and your social life so that you'll graduate and still have a blast!

Order your cap and gown plenty early.,
Try it on and make sure it fits.,
Put your graduation cap on correctly.,
Putting the rest of your attire on correctly.",How to Look Good at Graduation1," Your school will have a ordering process for your cap and gown. Order it plenty early to avoid scrambling at the last minute.


Keep your graduation attire until graduation. You'll want to take everything out and make sure it's all there. Your package should come with four main components: a gown, cap, tassel and hood. ;
, Gowns are based on your height and the length should come down to at least your knees and be loose fitting. Hats are generally come in a universal size but you'll want to make sure it fits.

, Your cap, also known as a mortar board will be flat with a square top. It should be put on your head so that the board (the flat part) is parallel to your shoulders. The hat will have a tassel attached to the top on a button. It is customary that the tassel hangs on the right side of the hat until you graduate, then you move it to the left side of the board. If you have long hair, bring along bobby pins in case you need to fasten the cap to your hair to prevent it from flying off in the wind.

, You may also need to wear a particular hood or cords depending on your degree or distinctions. Advanced degrees usually come with particular hood colors based on your department and should be put on over your head so that it drapes across the shoulders and down the back of the gown with the lining of the hood down to display its colors.


If you have any honors cords, they should be draped over the left side of your gown.

Decide on a date and time.Because many people may be planning graduation parties around the same time of year, the logistics of choosing a time for your party can be difficult.,
Throw a combined party.,
Choose a venue.Think about the approximate number of people you’d like to invite to your party.,

Consider having your party a few weeks after graduation, as many people choose to take trips or go on vacation directly after graduation day.
Have your party during June or July, as many of your friends will start to leave in August and move into college campuses.
Plan to have your party on a weekend day between 12p.m. and 6p.m., as this is when most of your guests will be able to come.
When picking the date for your party, don’t forget to take into account large events of other family members you plan to invite. For example, if someone you know has a wedding in the summer, be sure to schedule your party during a different weekend.;
, This can be a great way to save money and create a fun, lively atmosphere. Ask a few of your good friends if they’d like to combine their graduation party with yours.


Combined parties work well for high school graduations, as all graduates have achieved the same goal and have graduated at the same time.
Keep in mind, however, that you may not be able to invite as many extended family members to a combined graduation party.

, You want to make sure that you have enough space to host all of your guests.


Many people choose to host graduation parties at their homes. You can have an indoor party or set up tables and chairs outside for a festive summer bash. This is the least expensive option, so take into account how much money you’re willing to spend on a party.
If you don’t want to have your party at someone’s house, consider public party venues like restaurants, hotels, country clubs, beaches, pools, campgrounds, or parks., You want to invite your friends, some of your extended family, and teachers or coaches who you really appreciate.


Decide whether you want to send out paper invitations or invitations through email or Facebook.
You can also send some paper invitations to family, and use a Facebook event to invite your friends to your party. You can find many printable invitations online.
With a paper invitation, you can add a copy of your senior picture as a keepsake for family members.
If you do use a Facebook event, make sure that you set it to private so you don’t unintentionally invite too many people.
Include all the basic information for your party: when, where, and how to RSVP.
Make it clear in your invitation whether or not it’s okay for your guests to bring other people with them, as well.

, Though it’s traditional for graduation parties, don’t feel obligated to use your high school colors as the central theme. A few possible themes include:


“Tropical Hawaiian”: This is great for an outdoor party. You can light tiki torches, serve fruit punch, put grass skirts around tables, and play beach music.
“Last Chance to Be a Kid”: This is a great way to let loose, and let everyone have a bit of kid fun. Invite your guests to bring water guns, fill up water balloons, and have an outdoor water fight, followed by a barbeque.

, In addition to a main meal, serve a variety of finger foods and snacks throughout the party.


You can have the party catered, make your own food, or have a mix of homemade and catered foods.
Think of dishes you can make ahead of time like casseroles and cold salads.
Allow guests to assemble their foods. Choose dishes like tacos, spaghetti, chili, burgers and hotdogs, salads, or sandwiches that guests can make how they like them. Just have a table set up buffet-style.
Consider making or buying a cake that says congrats for the graduate. In addition to cake, you might want other desserts like an ice cream sundae bar, cookies, or bowls of candy.
To take the pressure off of cooking, think about making your graduation party a potluck party. Ask each guest to bring one dish with them. This can be fun, and it helps make the party less expensive for you.

, Start with a banner that says “Congrats Grads!”


Add balloons and streamers in your high school colors or in a color that matches the theme of your party.
Consider make a memory jar, and placing pencils and slips of paper beside it. Ask each of your guests to write down one memory they have with you from high school.
Add a bit of nostalgia. A high school graduation party is an ideal place to reminisce about past life events. Display pictures from throughout the years.
If you’re throwing a graduation party for multiple graduates, it can be fun to have a baby photo guessing game. Tack up photos of each graduate as a small child and have each guest try to decide who is who.

Wear comfortable and style underneath your gown.,
Wear something with pockets.,
Decide how you want your hair to look.,
Take your graduation attire into consideration when doing make-up.,
Pick out comfortable and stylish shoes.,
Choose accessories that accent your outfit and gown.",How to Look Good at Graduation2," Most schools typically choose dark neutral colors like blue or black for your cap and gown. You'll want your outfit to match. Wear something sleek since your robe will already be bulky. A loose, free flowing dress is a great option, especially in bold, bright colors. For guys, a classic dressy look without a suit coat jacket can make a great look. A tie is a must. If you are celebrating after graduation with a party or dinner, know whether you'll have time to change. If you won't, wear an outfit you'll also be comfortable in without the cap and gown. Check the weather. You'll want to prepare for the temperature and bad weather.

, You aren't going to be able to wear a bag or purse on stage and you may want your keys, wallet and phone nearby. This can also be useful to keep your phone to take pictures of your friends to remember the day.

, You'll likely wear a graduation cap, but you can still choose a unique style that will look great whether your cap is on or off. If your hair is longer, you may be stuck in a warm, cramped environment so you'll likely want to keep your hair off your neck to help stay cool. A simple pony-tail, side-braid, or your hair up can be great ways to keep cool and look good once the cap comes off. If you are using some sort of product of hairspray, make sure to use a heat protectant spray and primer so it can handle the heat under your cap. This definitely applies for guys who may want to avoid wearing any sort of hair product that can sweat down. Find a picture of the hairstyle you want.That way whether it's your hairdresser, barber, or friend, they can clearly see the vision you have in your head for how you want to look.

, The cap will draw attention to your face so make sure your skin and things like eye-brows are exactly how you want them. Also, the cap will case a shadow on your face which can give you the appearance of dark circles, even if you don't usually have them. Adding a little extra concealer, particularly under your eyes, can help this. Avoid any overly heavy make-up that may sweat off or make your skin feel suffocated.

, Virtually the only thing people will be able to see are your shoes. You'll want to choose a dressy pair but also something that is comfortable. You may have to walk from the staging area to your seat and of course across stage. While a pair of stilettos may be inappropriate, you'll want to avoid being overly casual like a pair of flip flops. , Since most of your outfit will be hidden, and you have little choice over the cap and gown you'll wear, finding some accessories like jewelry can be a great way to personalize your look. A classic necklace like a string of pearls can really personalize your look as well as your favorite earrings.


Sometimes there is custom jewelry made and sold by your school for the occasion. This can be a good way to commemorate the event with a piece of jewelry you'll always have.

Choose a date and time.,
Choose a venue for your party.College towns often get crowded and busy during graduation weekends.,
Invite your friends and family.College graduation is a special occasion, and you want to ensure that you are not leaving anyone out.,
Set the mood for your graduation party.For college graduation parties, extravagant decorations or planned activities are not usually necessary.,
Serve party food and beverages.A good party isn’t complete without plenty to eat and drink.",How to Throw a Graduation Party2," Before you begin to plan your graduation party, you’ll want to pick a date. Unlike a high school graduation party, most college graduates plan parties around the graduation weekend, as many people leave soon after.


Consider the time of your graduation. For example, if you have an afternoon or morning graduation ceremony, you may be able to have your graduation party on the night of your actual graduation. However, this may be more difficult if you have a late afternoon or evening graduation ceremony.
Know your close friends’ graduation times. In college, different schools and majors graduate on different days or at different times. If you want to invite your significant other or close friends to your party, make sure to plan around their graduations, as well as yours.

, If you can have your graduation party at your house or apartment, this is often the best and least expensive venue option.


Other options for college graduation party venues include local bars, restaurants, or parks.
If you do plan to book a venue, make sure you do so well in advance, several months if possible. Many graduates will be competing for reservations during the same weekends.

, Make sure to invite all of your family who are coming to the graduation ceremony.


Consider throwing your graduation party with some of your closest friends. That way, you can all celebrate with your families together.
Decide whether you want to use paper or electronic invitations. Because graduation ceremony invitations are often on paper, it can be simple to use electronic invitations for your graduation party.
If you do use electronic invitations, consider setting up an online way that your family and friends can send monetary graduation gifts to the graduate. Even though guests usually send money upon receiving a formal graduation ceremony invitation, this can be a nice way to reach out to more extended family. Crowd funding sites are a great way to do this. Simply include a link in your electronic invitations. This is only appropriate if you are throwing the party for a graduate other than yourself, as it may be perceived as rude to ask for money for yourself., Just add a few things to make the occasion seem festive.


Consider including a board filled with photographs from the graduate’s college experience.
Hang balloons or streamers in the college’s colors.
Make a playlist for the party. Include fun, upbeat songs. Attach your music-playing device to speakers, and let it play throughout the party. Music adds festivity to your celebration without being obtrusive.

, Keep it simple, and serve snack foods and finger foods.


If you plan to have a meal, either have it catered or make it something guests can assemble, like a taco bar or grilled hotdogs and hamburgers.
Serve drinks, or tell guests that the party is BYOB.

Set up a board games table.,
Play interactive games.These games, like charades, will be a little more lively.,
Set up a DIY photo booth.This is a great way to remember your high school graduation party.,
Give a graduation party toast.This can be a great way to honor the graduate and celebrate their great accomplishment.",How to Throw a Graduation Party3," At a graduation party, you want to make sure you have plenty of different activities to entertain your guests.Even if you are hosting an outdoor graduation party, having an indoor board games table can be a great way to give your guests an option to cool off inside.


Create a table where you can lay out all of your board games for people to choose from. Make sure you have plenty of chairs for guests to sit in.
Offer a variety of games. Choose some that can be played with as few as two people.
Board games are an easy activity to set up, and they will provide plenty of entertainment to your party guests without requiring you to facilitate.

, You can play games in pairs or teams.


Set up a large pad of paper have guests play Pictionary.Come up with your own clues. These can be random, or you can relate them back to graduation.
If you are outdoors, you can play games like Twister and cornhole. , Guests will enjoy playing with props and taking silly pictures, and they’ll have a memento from the occasion.


Use a large piece of paper or a sheet as a backdrop against a wall. This can be plain or patterned.
Add a banner that has the name of the graduate’s school and the year.
Use poster board to create props like speech bubbles, giant mustaches, and hats for party guests to hold up as they snap photos together on their phones.

, The person who gives the speech or toast should be someone who knows the graduate well, either a family member or good friend.


Make sure to speak to the specific strengths and accomplishments of the graduate, and wish them luck in the future.
Use quotes to make your speak more elegant.
Toast with champagne or sparkling juice.

Look at dress codes.,
Pick the right fabric for the season.,
Decide on a budget.,
Choose the right length.,
Compliment the color of your cap and gown.,
Match your dress to your shoes.,
Start the hunt early.,
Take along a trusted friend or relative for opinions.,
Consider online options.,
Find the right print and color.,
Remember you’ll be in front of family and teachers.,
Remember the after party.,
Flatter your figure.,
Choose a neckline.,
Show off your personality.,
Alter your dress.",How to Find a Graduation Dress," Some schools may prohibit strapless or spaghetti strapped dresses. If this is the case, don’t look for graduation dresses that would violate the dress code. Check with a teacher, professor or prior graduate, if you’re unsure of where to find a handbook.;
, If you graduate in the spring, you may not want to wear a wool, sweater dress. Besides that, you may get toasty in the graduation auditorium with loads of people. Cotton, silk and rayon are all light weight fabrics good for spring. If you happen to be graduating in the fall, choose thick cotton or cotton blends, which will still breathe under your robe.Linen is a great fabric for extra hot humid months, because of its superior breathability.
Wool is great in cold weather, because it will insulate yet breathe.

, You will find a huge variety of places to shop for dresses. This includes everywhere from discount chain stores to specialty boutiques that sell wedding dresses too. You can find the right dress no matter where you shop, but keeping your budget in mind can help narrow down the playing field. Remember that different department stores have different prices.Look at discount stores, like Forever 21 or some online shops, if your budget falls below one-hundred dollars.
You can look in department stores, if you have a budget of up to three-hundred dollars.
Boutique dress shops are for when money is no object.

, Most dresses are going to look best right above or below the knee on graduation day. If you happen to have a formal dinner or celebration after the ceremony, you may look at longer dresses, but make sure they are not too long. You wouldn’t want to trip on your way to the stage.

, Keep your graduation colors in mind as you shop for dresses. Just because most of it will be covered, doesn’t mean hemlines or necklines can’t peek out. Choose a color that will match your school colors, so it will look nice in pictures and with or without the robe on. Do not wear a hot pink dress with an orange cap.

, In all actuality, it will be your shoes that will be seen the most on your walk to stage. Pick your shoes out first and match your dress to them. Make sure you can walk comfortably and match not only the color of your dress, but the style to them. Wedges may match with a light-colored, flirty dress, while black, leather pumps may be better with a sheath dress., Don't stress yourself out by shopping for a graduation dress at the last minute. Start looking as soon as you can, preferably a few months ahead of time. You'll be able to weigh your options, stay on budget, and find one that perfectly flatters you., Sometimes it's hard to decide on important things like a graduation dress on your own. A close friend or relative can tell you what looks good and what doesn't. Use your own judgement first, but they can point things out about fit and colors you may not normally notice.


Take along fellow graduates, if you can. This will prevent you from choosing the same dress.

, Online dress shops often have a wide selection. Use filters to narrow down your choices. Filter by choices like style, cut, print, length, or occasion. Some online shops even have selections specifically for graduation day. Review the return policy before you buy in case you don't like a dress, after you try it on., The time of year you graduate is going to play an important part in choosing a print and color. Light-colored floral dresses are appropriate in the spring, while dark gingham is more appropriate in the fall. This is just a guideline though! Let your personal style show through above all else., Flatter your figure to your heart’s delight, but remember too much body hugging fabric may be inappropriate on graduation day. Skip the clubwear and opt for a semi-formal or casual dress that is cute, yet leaves room for the imagination.

, Graduation day rarely includes just a graduation ceremony. You will probably at least go to dinner with close friends and family. Wear a summer dress for an outdoor graduation party, or a dress you can take out on the town to dance the night away.

, The style of dress you decide on is going to have a lot to do with what looks good on your body type. You can minimize areas you’re self conscious about, or emphasize parts of your body you’re proud of. Show off your hourglass figure with a belted or cinched waist. Choose an empire waist, if you want your dress to flow loosely around a mid-section.


Play up curves with ruched fabric around the bust and hips.
Down-play your bottom half with a dress fitted from the waist up and flared out below it.
Offset broad shoulders by wearing an A-line dress that flares out slightly at the waist., Necklines of dresses come in as much variety as the cut. If you have special jewelry for graduation day, like your grandmother’s pearl necklace, you definitely need to decide on a neckline. You may want a scalloped or v-neck to show it off. Choose no neckline at all with a strapless dress and wear a statement necklace.Go conservative with a high neckline.
A little cleavage is fine, but don’t go overboard.

, The best way to feel good in what you’re wearing is by showing off your style and personality. Be feminine with ruffles and bows. Be chic in something simple and dark. Be glamorous with touches of sparkle or sequins. Wearing a dress that helps express your individual style will keep you glowing on graduation day., Sometimes you may find the perfect dress, but need the waist or bust taken in. The fit of a dress is important. Make sure you go to a well reviewed seamstress for measurements and alterations. They can put the final touches on a dress to help you feel your best."

Always make sure you are allowed to decorate.,
Have a plan.,
Gather up your supplies.",How to Decorate Your Graduation Cap1," You don’t want to spend hours slaving away over your cap only to find out you aren’t allowed to wear it. Ask a teacher or school counselor you trust to make sure you aren’t breaking any rules., Before you decorate, sit down and think about not only the message you wish to portray, but the decorating scheme as well. This will prevent your cap from looking like a hot mess. Get some colored pencils and brainstorm on scrap paper.


Involve your friends to make this a fun group night. Have everyone bring over decorating supplies, make some snacks, and brainstorm together. Decorating together will also allow your group to apply a theme while keeping your hats individual.A theme will work especially well if you’re on a sports team or in a club together.

, There’s nothing worse than starting a craft project and realizing you’re missing components to it. By applying a plan, you can make a list of materials and gather them up before getting started."

Brainstorm about what your experience in school has meant to you.,
Start to develop a theme.,
Think about the structure of your speech.,
Start the introduction with something catchy.,
Make the middle of your speech interesting and remember to tie it in with your theme.,
Use your conclusion to draw a lesson.",How to Deliver a Graduation Speech2," You've been in school for quite a while now. Ask yourself: What has this experience taught me, or others, about life, about success, and about growing up along the way?


Some other questions you might ask yourself as a way to brainstorm ideas:
How have I changed since I started this level of school? How might other classmates have changed since they started?
What is the most important lesson I can take away from my time in school?
What are some success stories that happened during your time in school?
What are some of the challenges we face in the next leg of our journey, and how are we better prepared to overcome those challenges now that we're here?



, You want your graduation speech to have a theme. Your theme can be very specific or very broad, but you want a theme in order to tie everything together. Without a theme, it can seem like you're just reminiscing about your time, and there's no lesson or moral your speech. Some common themes include:



Adversity. Adversity is the challenges that you as a group overcame in order to get where you are now. Maybe one of your classmates got diagnosed with cancer, and taught the rest of the class how to fight, not just a disease like cancer, but any obstacles that come your way. This is adversity.

Maturity. An especially good theme for high school students, maturity is about becoming an adult and taking responsibility. Perhaps you can talk about how young and green most Freshman were when you started, and how Seniors now have grown into shining examples of people who are adults, not because they need to be, but because they want to be.

Life lessons. School is a microcosm for life. That's a fancy way of saying that school helps teach people about life in general. School teaches you that hard work pays off, that there's more to learning than memorizing equations, that what you do outside the classroom is just as important as what you do inside, and that the friends you make are the glue that keeps you together.

, The structure is where you place each part in the speech so that what you're saying makes sense.


Consider using the burger method. The top bun is your introduction; the patty is your ideas in paragraph form; and the bottom bun is your conclusion. Use a lot of ketchup, mayonnaise, and other condiments: They are your jokes, but remember that too much mayonnaise can ruin an otherwise good burger.

, It can be an interesting quote, fact, story or even a good joke about your school or class. Whatever it is, it needs to grab the attention of your audience. This means it needs to be relevant and catchy. Perhaps start off with something like this:


""I remember when we all filed into this room four years ago. We looked young, like we had just walked out of bed. And while all of us now look older, I see that most of us still look as sleepy as we did on that fateful day.""
""I don't want to alarm you, but the class of 20— has a serious problem. It's not a financial problem. It's not an intellectual problem. It's an attitude problem. The class of 20— has a problem being awesome.""


, Start off strong. Put your best idea in right in the beginning to hook people in.


Make it interesting by saying something unexpected. If you're talking about facing adversity, everyone expects you to talk about tests, dating/relationships, and time management. Why not talk about something unexpected? Talk about how grades aren't always a sign that you have learned, maybe, or about how hard it is to let teachers let their guard down. Surprise your audience in novel ways.
Make sure your theme is never far away. Ask yourself: How does this paragraph relate back to my theme? If it doesn't relate, ask yourself why it's there.

, Take your theme and ask the question So what? What can we learn from the theme? This will be your lesson. Some lessons might sound a little something like this:


""In conclusion, high school has taught us that the grades that we earn aren't as important as the education that we receive. We earn a grade for taking a History test. We get an education for understanding why slavery is immoral. We earn a grade for taking a math test. We get an education for understanding that mathematical models can help us fly. We earn a grade for writing an English essay. We get an education for understanding that words are poems and poems are beautiful.""
""When I think of our class, I don't think of any one person, I think of a community of workers, a family. A community has a certain responsibility, and as of yet, we have never forgotten that responsibility. As we walk off into the wider world today, let us not forget the responsibility that we carry both as members of this community, and as citizens of the world.

Speak slowly.,
Pause for effect.,
Have the speech memorized, mostly.,
Make good eye contact with your audience.,
Don't worry about mess-ups.,
Put feeling into your voice.,
Be confident, not cocky.,
Practice your speech ahead of time.",How to Deliver a Graduation Speech3," When you get up in front of lots of people, with your heart beating and your mouth dry, it'll be tempting to speed things up. Good speeches, however, are almost always delivered slowly, with force and feeling behind each word. Remember to slow down.


Listen to a speech by Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the most effective public speakers ever, and pay attention to how slowly he speaks. Slow speeches sound really good because they let the audience process what is being said.
Practice delivering your speech into a voice recorder and listen to the recording. You'll see that even when you think you're speaking slowly, it comes out a lot quicker than you imagine. There's always an opportunity to slow down.

, Don't be afraid to take a breath or two after you've finished a sentence. Give the audience time to make sense out of what you're saying. Pause after you deliver a really heartfelt sentence so that the meaning of the sentence can sink in.

, Have the speech memorized so that you're not just looking down at your notes, reading off of a piece of paper. Reading off of a piece of paper can make the speech sound robotic, robbing it of all the natural rhythm and flow of the language.

, Making good eye contact will allow you to grab the audience not just with your words, but also with your eyes and with your presence. This is a really important part of public speaker that is easily overlooked because it is so hard to master.


Scan the audience every once in a while. If you're reading your speech, you'll obviously spend a lot of time looking at your paper. When you finish a sentence, however, look up from the dais and scan the people in the audience. This will help you catch your breath.
Don't be afraid of focusing on one person for a short while. It's not uncommon for a speaker to lock eyes with a person in the audience for two, three, or four seconds. (Four seconds is a really long time when you're alone on a podium!) Don't do it all the time, but try to do it every once in a while.

, If you mess up a line, don't worry about it or apologize. Get the line right and move on. The less you labor over your mistakes (which you will make; everyone does), the less they'll be noticed.

, Don't ramble on in a monotone voice for eight minutes or you'll put everyone to sleep. Get excited about your speech, and let your excitement bleed into your voice. Mix up the volume, pitch, and speed of your voice for an even better delivery.

, Be confident in your ability to make people laugh, to help them understand you better, to inspire them to be better people and to realize their full potential. You're delivering this speech for a reason, right? Trust in the people who trust in you and reward them for their trust.


If you're getting nervous, try out the old public speaking trick of imagining someone in the audience being naked. Don't fixate on it, but imagine it. It will help rake away some of the butterflies and allow you to concentrate on delivering a more confident speech.

, Practicing your speech ahead of time, perhaps on a few trusted friends, will do two things:


It will get you in the habit of what works in the speech and what doesn't. There's still time to change that joke that no one understands, or focus more on that part that your friends really like.
It will help you memorize the speech, making you less nervous and giving you better presence.

Use a fabric pen to write out a message.,
Apply crystals with a glue gun.,
Glue glitter paper onto the base of your hat.",How to Decorate Your Graduation Cap2," Fabric pens are exactly what they sound like: Pens that can be safely and effectively used on fabric. They come in any color imaginable and have special features such as metallics, glitter or opaque. Fabric pens are used similarly to regular pens, with the exception being that you squeeze while you move the pen to release the color.Use caution when working with glue. If a fabric pen gets in your eye or is accidentally deposited onto skin, immediately use a water rinse to remove it., A glue gun is a practical way to neatly add on rhinestones. To apply, lay your rhinestones upside down on a piece of paper towel or cardboard.Squeeze a small amount of glue onto the back of the rhinestone. Count to three so the glue becomes tacky, and using tweezers, gently pick the rhinestone up and push into your desired spot on your cap.Rhinestones and a glue gun can be picked up at most dollar or craft stores. They come in a huge assortment of sizes and colors, so get creative.
If you don’t have a steady enough hand for applying rhinestones, invest in a pre-made embellishment. These will often have several rhinestones in the shape of words or pictures with one, solid, tacky back, so they can be applied all together., Glitter paper is available at most craft stores and can be trimmed to fit the base of your hat. After trimming, apply glue with the glue gun or glue stick to the edges of your paper.Line up the edges with your hat and gently but firmly apply the paper to the top of your hat.


Not a fan of the glitter paper? This trick would work with any paper, including newspaper, wrapping paper, or maps.

Make your own stencil.,
Stick the stencil onto your grad cap.,
Get painting.,
Wait for your paint to dry and remove the stencil.",How to Decorate Your Graduation Cap3," To make your own stencil, draw out your design or lettering on a simple piece of printer paper. After laying down a protective top to your table, such as cardboard, lay the printer paper right side up. Use an exacto knife to slowly and carefully cut out your design.Once satisfied with your cut job, voila! Your stencil is ready to go.


Many pre-made stencils are available at your local dollar store.This allows you to skip both the drawing and cutting of your stencil. Another option is to print your desired image directly onto your paper, so it only needs be cut.
Up your stencil game by laminating your paper before cutting. This allows your stencil to have a smoother edge and prevents bleeding into the rest of your cap after painting.

, Lie up where you want your stencil to be placed and play with different locations.Once you’ve decided on the spot, tape the stencil down taut against your cap. The tape will prevent the stencil from shifting while you paint.

, Using a smaller paintbrush for more control, gently paint within your stencil. For a precise edging, hold down the stencil firmly to the cap while painting the edges.Be careful to not overdo it, as any excess paint runs the risk of bleeding.


If you can, use fabric paint. Specifically formulated for fabric, fabric paint will age with grace.If you don’t have the option of this, stick with simple acrylic from the dollar store.
Add some school spirit to your hat by stenciling in your school’s logo or colors.This can be a simple but effective way to add excitement for your peers and teachers during your drawn out, boring grad ceremony.

, It is better to be cautious and wait overnight for your paint to dry. Waiting longer will mean your paint is solidified and the stencil will pull away cleanly. Once you are confident the paint is solid, you can lift the tape and gently pull the stencil away.Waiting will also ensure any wet paint on the stencil does not rub off onto your hands or the rest of your cap.

Write about a memorable moment you had together.,
Add a quote.,
Write song lyrics.,

Add a signature phrase.,
Make your entry pop.,
Don’t tease or make fun of other students or the yearbook owner.,
Keep it clean.,
Avoid confessions.,
Don’t use acronyms.,
Sign your full name.",How to Sign a Yearbook," Are they a good friend, a best friend, or just someone you've seen around in the halls? Write your message accordingly. Be honest but nice.For friends, write an inside joke or a memory you have together. You can also write a sweet message like ""Dear Alexis, I had an awesome time getting to know you this year, you're a great person and an amazing friend. I will miss you so much! Can't wait to see you again next year! XOXO, Michele.”
For acquaintances, keep it simple. Write “hope you had a good year” or “have a terrific summer.” Don’t say something like “I had so much fun with you this year” if that’s not the case.
For teachers, simply thank them and sign your name.
Be sure to spell the yearbook owner's name properly. If you can't remember their name or don't know how to spell it, just write ""Yo"" or ""Hey!"";
, Apportion the space according to how well you know the yearbook's owner; more space for a closer friendship, a whole lot less for a class acquaintance with whom you've had very little to do.


Perhaps apply a rule about space usage: For example, use about two inches by three inches if he or she is someone you know moderately well, and four by four inches if he or she is your absolute best friend.

, If what you add is messy, the owner won't be able to understand your witticisms or pearl or wisdom. If it's legible, then he/she will remember how cool you were and who you were.

, Don't hog the book all day; it is both annoying and obstructive to take a yearbook and not return it for twenty minutes. There are many people wanting to add their two cents worth too.


If you want to be witty and that comes slowly to you, think about what you might add before the yearbooks come out. You could even write out a list of ideas for specific people you really want to say something special to.

, You want to make others smile when they read your message, so add a fun greeting or joke to your message. For good friends, reference a moment that made you laugh together. It will be fun to read the entry years later and remember the good times. You can also choose a fun opening line., These will be fun to read in the future. Writing something like “remember when Mr. Thompson caught the exam key on fire during chemistry?” shows you recall sharing a special moment with the yearbook owner., Choose a favorite quote to add to your message. Something like “Dream as if you’ll live forever. Live as if you’ll die today,” (James Dean) or “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars,” (Les Brown) are timeless messages.

, Jot down a few lines to a favorite song if they are relevant to your relationship with the yearbook owner. It will be fun for the person to look back and see words to a song they listened to in school. Don’t take up a whole page to write out the entire song, though.

, If you’re a good artist, draw a quick picture and sign your name, rather than writing a message. Keep it clean and classy so you don’t offend the owner.

, Come up with a signature phrase to write in yearbooks. Ideas include “This year has been a blast and has gone too fast!” “I can’t wait to see what next year brings!” ""Remember Grant, Remember Lee, to heck with them, remember me!"" or even ""It tickles me and makes me laugh, to think you want my autograph."" If you want to be cheeky, you can say something like ""I'm so glad you got to meet me this year.""

, Use different colors, write in a fun script, or make a border to make it look cool. He/she may think that you didn't really care about signing their yearbook if you don't show it.

, Always be nice and respectful with your message. If you don’t have something nice to say, just sign your name or add a generic statement like “enjoy your summer.” People will remember you by what you write in their yearbook, and no one wants to be the jerk who wrote rude comments in high school.

, Don’t use profanity or make inappropriate jokes. Though you may think it’s funny now, chances are it won’t be as amusing in 10-20 years. Plus, teachers often sign yearbooks and the last thing you want is to get into trouble right before school lets out for the summer.

, Yearbook signing is not an opportunity to pour your heart out to the person you’ve been crushing on all year. You will likely be embarrassed by this later, especially if the person you confess to doesn’t read or respond to your message., Though you may be tempted to write H.A.G.S. (have a great summer) or S.Y.N.Y. (see you next year), you should avoid using acronyms. In 20 years when people are looking back through their yearbooks, they may have no idea what these acronyms mean. Take the time to spell out your well-wishes rather than abbreviating them., Use your full name, rather than your initials, when signing someone’s yearbook. In the future, they may not remember who J.D. is, especially if there’s a Jessica Davis, John Duncan, and a Josie Daniels in your class or school. Write your full first name and at least the first letter of your last name as well."

Use non-liquid foundation to avoid oily looking skin. As for lipstick, avoid adult colors such as a brownish-red. Hot pink, light pink, or lip gloss would look nice.


Remember that makeup colors - especially lipstick - tend to look darker and more pronounced in photos, especially black-and-white photos!
For a great photo, apply a special cream to hide any pimples or unattractive spots on your face. Concealer also works, but it's best not to apply it to pimples.

, Some people appear stunning when they show their teeth during their smile while others may look better by just curving their lips without showing their teeth. It's best if you ask for a friend's advice or a family member's advice.


When asking for a family member's advice, it's best to ask your mom. Even though the idea may not appeal to you, mothers can give great advice on your appearance, especially since they know you best!

, Keep in mind that this outfit is what you'll be wearing for the whole school day so make sure that it looks and feels fantastic. However, make sure it remains within your school's dress code - if you have one - or you may end up getting in trouble.


Avoid wearing a plain T-shirt or the blouse you already outgrew because you won't look as good than if you wore something that fit you. Make your outfit a little more dressier than usual, but be careful about going overboard!
It's best to wear an outfit or a certain color that you've received many compliments for wearing before.

, Avoid grabbing any old pair on your way out the door. Instead, slip on or purchase a comfortable, pretty pair that is easy to match with your outfits and style.


Don't purchase shoes that you'll only wear one time or only with that certain outfit. Otherwise, your money will go to waste and so will the shoes!
Make sure that your shoes match your outfit. Don't wear a pair of running sneakers with a fashionable outfit.

, Be careful about wearing too many, however. Limit yourself to only one or two. Suggested accessories are:


Earrings
Bracelets
Necklaces
Hair decorations
Scarves

, Although it may feel a little uncomfortable, the picture will turn out beautiful. If you're not comfortable doing this or you don't have enough experience to do this properly, wait till next year to try it out or practice it in front of the mirror the night before picture day till you feel confident.

, As the photographer does the count down, close your eyes. When he/she says, ""One"" before snapping the photo, quickly open your eyes and let out your natural smile - while keeping the good memory in mind - before the picture is taken. This will make sure you don't blink and it'll give you a more natural appearance. However, make sure you have good timing or you might still have closed eyes or you'll be caught in the middle of opening your eyes!

Make a good first impression.,
Be involved in class.,
Ask for help when you need it.,
Take good notes in class.,
Don't be friends with your teacher.",How to Deal With Math Teachers1," Teachers are like any other person, so it’s important to try to make a good first impression. Showing that you are a student interested in the class and in learning goes a long way to getting along well with your math teacher.


Introduce yourself to the teacher. Make sure he or she knows who you are personally in addition to being another student. Act friendly towards your teacher. Don’t be fake, but make eye contact, smile, and be generally warm towards him or her.
Be responsible. Show up on time and do your work. Make sure to always pay attention. Don’t put your head down or stare off into space. ;
, Many students do not get involved enough in class. Class is where you learn how to do your homework and tests. Make sure to stay interested and involved, which will help you learn more.


Sit near the front. Students who sit near the front can be more involved in class. If you sit in the back row, your teacher may think you are not interested in the class.
Ask if you have any questions. Teachers like it when students ask questions. It shows they’re paying attention and interested in learning. It’s important to be interactive with what you’re learning. Do not be shy about trying out a math problem in front of the class, even if you don't know how to do it. The point is to learn in class, not get every question right.

, Sometimes, students are afraid to ask for help. However, asking for help just means that you are learning. Make sure to ask plenty of questions of the teacher


Talk to your teacher on a regular basis. You should be keeping in contact with your teacher throughout the class. Don’t make the first time you talk to him or her when you are really struggling.
See if the teacher can offer additional teaching or tutoring. Some teachers may be able to help you out in addition to class hours.
Think about getting a tutor. If you’re really struggling with math, you may need to look into tutoring. Tutors are often around at your school or you can see if you can find a private tutor to help you understand your work. , When you’re in class, you should always be taking notes on what’s happening in class and anything important your teacher says. These notes are invaluable when you’re confused or studying later for a test. Write down any definitions and new concepts. When your teacher is introducing anything new, make sure to write down anything that seems important or any questions you may have.
Have an organized system of taking notes. Put a date and topic on each page of notes. Try to end each day of notes with major concepts learned and questions you still have.
Use your notes to review and study for tests. Keeping good notes will help you to do better on tests and to make sure you understanding how different concepts relate to one another.

, Try to remember that your teacher is not your friend. They are their to help you learn the material first and foremost.


Maintain a professional relationship with your teacher. Make sure to maintain boundaries, especially since school is your professional environment. Don't be overly friendly, since this will likely make your teacher uncomfortable.
Talk to your teachers about your life, but don't get too personal. They don't need to know anything about your personal life. Instead, try talking about shared interests or local sports teams.Realize that you may not get along with your teacher. Your personalities may clash. If that happens, just keep in mind that you only need to learn from your teacher and not become friends or even friendly. "

Just say no if they want to be your friend on Facebook.,
Keep track of when they give pop quizzes.",How to Deal With Annoying Teachers1," If your teacher is a hard grader, try to get more details when they give an assignment. Ask if there is anything specific they are looking for, and if there's anything you should avoid.;
, Some teachers have a habit of going off on a tangent, and telling long stories that aren't related to the subject. Try not to look too bored, and just wait until they get back on track.

, Not only would this be terribly embarrassing, it is sure to cause problems. A teacher should never insist on being part of your social life, so just tell them you only add friends and family on social media.

, Some teachers have a knack for hitting you with a pop quiz when you are least prepared. They probably aren't completely random events, however. Figure out when they're most likely to surprise you, so you can be prepared.


Some teachers like to give pop quizzes after an assigned reading.
If you haven't had a major test in a few weeks, be prepared for a quiz.
Some teachers punish a rowdy class with a pop quiz. If your class seems to be annoying the teacher, start reading through your notes just in case.

Become a Model Student

Address the teacher respectfully.,
Help the teacher with whatever he/she needs such as carrying materials to her class


Have all the supplies you need with you for every class period.",How to Deal With Teachers That Hate Your Guts," This doesn't mean it's impossible but it does mean you have your work cut out for you and there's nothing like a challenge to give spice to your purpose in life. See it from the teacher's perspective––would you trust you after the misbehaving, slacking off, rudeness or unwillingness to helpful? It can be hard to believe a leopard will change its spots overnight. However, in your favor is the fact that on the whole, teachers do expect students to keep learning from their mistakes and improving.;
, In the former case, you should have no problems convincing the teacher that you've turned over a new leaf, provided you truly mean it. In the latter case, you are going to have to provide many actions that speak louder than words examples and still some before that teacher will feel that you've improved in your ways.

, They have personal problems, family lives, deadlines and other students to deal with. By remembering that they're human too, you can stop demonizing the teacher and start to look for connecting points that might win you an in with the teacher. This doesn't mean you have to like the teacher––that's not the point. It simply means finding ways to show to the teacher that you are considerate and respectful of their needs and wants too.


After trying to mend bridges, if your teacher still appears to dislike you, consider that your teacher may just be having a bad day or is going through a tough time at the moment. Either way, it's a good idea to not ask them what is going on as this can make them worse.

, Most ""mean"" teachers are unhappy people or have had bad experiences with students in the past and are protecting themselves from future bad interactions. Sometimes it has nothing to do with you. They might feel that none of the students care about them, so try to be nice.


If your teacher seems miserable whether you are around them or not, chances are that you are not the problem.

, If you've done your best to make them like you and it doesn't work, grit your teeth and try to survive until the course is done. Once you are through with the course, you could talk to the principal to make sure you won't have this teacher again.

, Maybe it was that pin you put on your teacher's chair, or that time you forgot your homework three times in a row. Perhaps you talked back often in class or said mean things.






Apologize to your teacher. At least try to look like you mean it, and you may be forgiven. And remember to say what you did or said. ""Sorry miss"" is not as effective as ""I'm sorry for forgetting my homework three times in a row, it won't happen again"".







, Maybe you call out too much, or maybe your homework is always terrible. Perhaps you play up too much in class or give more cheek than anyone has the goodwill to cope with.






Put yourself in your teacher's shoes. Are you really that annoying? If the answer is yes, it is a good idea to break your bad habits.






Let the teacher notice you doing some good for a change. Try to do this in as many good ways as you can possibly can, such as keeping quiet when this is expected, offering to help out and keeping your smart witted comments under control. Stop chit chatting in class and actually get the assignments turned in when expected. Put away the slingshots and stop chewing gum. Make an effort to actually listen.






Sit near the back of the class if you can't tone down the giggles or annoying behaviors. At least this will put some distance between you both.







, Does she give the ripped-up homework an A+ and yours an F-? Does she shout ""WHAT?!"" whenever you ask a question? Remember that you are quite possibly just exaggerating, and that your teacher doesn't really hate you. You need to get the facts straight before complaining that your teacher hates you for no reason at all.






Gather factual evidence of things your teacher does that you consider single you out for unfair or unkind treatment. Note the action, the day and the occasion. Do this over a week or so, to build up a realistic picture. Do you still feel that your teacher is being unreasonable? If not, shape up by reading the suggestions below for being a model student. However, if you still feel the teacher is being unfair toward you on an objective assessment, move to the next step.






Look at how you are presenting yourself. If you are not exaggerating, and your teacher really does not treat you the same as others, your teacher may be doing this because he or she is stereotyping you. Come on, everyone does it. Maybe you wear ripped clothes, or maybe you look like a dumb blonde. Either way, your teacher shouldn't be giving you lower grades or treating you with no respect because of this.






Consider talking through those responsible for you, or even lodging a complaint. If this is becoming a serious problem, get your parents or guardian to have a chat with the teacher. If that doesn't work, talk with the principal.







, This may be sir or ma'am (""Yes, sir.""). Or, it might be Ms., Mrs. or Mr.






Don't act like you know better than them.


Be punctual at all times. Teachers love students who turn up on time and are settled and ready to engage as class starts.






Be in uniform (if you are supposed to be). This is one thing you don't need to flout around strict teachers, it's just not worth the angst.







Keep quiet. Teachers have a hard time with a loud class.






Pay close attention to the teacher while ignoring other students who might distract you. To show your attention, participate a lot and always raise your hand whenever the teacher has a question.






Don't seem to be ignoring them as this just gets teachers in a bad mood.
Don't be on websites that you are not supposed to if you are in a computer class. #**Don't play laptop games in class - that is a pet peeve of most teachers.


Act as if you're enjoying the class.

,






Remember your homework. Teachers hate students that always make an excuse and never bring their homework. So make sure that it's in your bag after you finish at the night before.






Turn in all assignments on time. As said on step 6, teachers hate students who never bring their assignments or homework or are late to turn them up.






Ask the teacher for a list of her/his favorite books she/he read at your age.






Make the teacher a card and just leave it on their desk. Tell them you appreciate that they are your teacher.






Show appreciation. Drop a few compliments such as, ""I like your teaching techniques, they're so helpful to understand!"" No matter how moody your teacher is, he/she will still appreciate your thoughtfulness.

, Your parents supported you all through high school and helped you to meet your state's graduation requirements, so it is important to be reciprocal and do something for them as well. It is advisable to let them choose the restaurant.

, This is a great way to highlight some of your best memories from all four years of high school. If you have pictures, it is recommended to include them as well.

, In addition to having the support of your parents, your teachers taught you what is necessary to learn in high school, and they helped you meet graduation requirements. Try creating a humorous poem, giving a gift card, or producing original songs for the teachers.

Relax during class and when taking tests.,
Give yourself time to do your work.,
Get rid of distractions.",How to Deal With Math Teachers2," Students are often so stressed out that they get distracted by their own reaction rather than dealing with the problem in front of them. Stay focused on the problems, not your reaction to them.


Take a deep breath. Even though math can be hard, taking a minute to gain perspective is important. Math class is not a life or death affair.Be prepared for class. The best way to be relaxed for class and during exams is knowing the material. Always do your homework and be ready to discuss that day’s material. Be honest about what you know and what you don’t. There’s no reason to pretend you know what you don’t. That only makes you more stressed out.

, Procrastination can cause a lot of problems in math classes. Always give yourself plenty of time to do your work. Don’t wait until the last minute. Do your homework as soon as you can after class.
Doing your work right after class means that the concepts are still fresh in you mind. This way you don’t have to review what you covered in class in order to do your homework.
Procrastination can cause you to fall behind in class. Since math classes usually build on the last lesson, it’s easy to get lost if you do not keep up with the work.

, Try to eliminate as many distractions as possible when trying to focus. Make sure your phone is out of reach. It’s tempting for many students to spend time on their phones rather than pay attention in class. Put your phone away during class or when you’re working on material for class.
Close out all windows on your computer if you’re working on math homework. You may want to check social media accounts or browse the Internet. Instead, don’t tempt yourself. If possible, try disconnecting from the Internet entirely.
Study in a quiet location. You don’t want to be distracted by outside noises. Find a place that’s comfortable for you, but will also encourage you to stay on task. "
"
Try multiple approaches.,
Work ahead.,
Try to help others.",How to Deal With Math Teachers3," It’s important to try different methods when approaching a new math concept. You may find different ways or methods of learning work best for you.


Draw a picture. You may be a visual learner. If possible, try to draw a picture or make a visual representation of the math concept or problem. Try working in groups. Some people learn better working with other people. Just make sure not to get too distracted. Act it out. If you're physical learner, try to act out the math problem. Getting up and moving around the room will hopefully get the blood flowing and help you think of the problem in a new and different way. , Once you get down the concepts you’re currently working on in class, look ahead in your textbook to see what’s coming next.


Preview some new concepts. Though you may be confused at first, looking at upcoming material before it’s discussed in class may give you some questions when it’s introduced.
Try out some sample problems. Once you start to learn the new concepts, try some sample problems. Though you may get them totally wrong, it’s useful to try them out
Don’t get too frustrated. If working ahead is too frustrating for you, it’s best to stay with the class. Try not to get too stressed out when you don’t understand, since it’s part of the learning process.

, Helping others with math is a good way to learn more about what you’re doing.


Join a math club. Math clubs can be a great place to talk about math and to increase your ability in math. Volunteer as a math tutor. Once you have a handle on the math concepts, offer to help tutor fellow students. This will help you to learn more about math and will also look good to your teacher.
Talk to your teacher about other opportunities to help others with math. He or she will be pleased that you’re interested and may have some suggestions that you’ve never thought about.

Kill them with kindness.,
Watch how other students interact with them.,
Always look like you're paying attention.,
Bring them a gift.,
Do extra credit.,
Don't do anything to make the situation worse.,
Rephrase confusing questions.",How to Deal With Annoying Teachers2," There is a saying that goes, “Always be extra nice to your enemies. Nothing annoys them more.” Try to be as polite as possible in class, and don't take the bait if your teacher tries to get a rise out of you.Eventually, this may wear them down and they'll start treating you like one of their favorites.
And if not – well, it will really annoy them that you don't seem to be upset by them anymore.

, Pay special attention to the kids that the teacher treats best. Try to act like they do, and use the same tone of voice. If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, ask yourself, “How would (your teacher's favorite) handle this? What would they probably say?”, The number one pet peeve of most teachers is being ignored in class. Think how it would feel if you read a report in class, and the kids started talking to each other like you weren't there – no fun, right?


Pretend you're taking notes. Work on homework for a different class, write a poem or story, or make “to-do” lists.
Avoid drawing or doodling, because most teachers can see that it isn't writing from across the room.

, If you're too shy to hand it to your teacher, leave it on their desk at the end of the day with a little note just saying the gift is from you and you hope they enjoy it.


If you get juice or a candy bar between classes, buy two and bring one to your teacher.
Pay attention to which topics your teacher seems to be most excited about, then print out a funny or interesting article about it.
Bake cookies or brownies, and wrap up a few little bundles of 2-3 cookies each. Hand them out to all your friends and teachers. This way it won't look like you specifically brought them to kiss up to your annoying teacher.

, If on assignment they give numbers 1-20 plus a bonus problem, always answer the bonus question. If your grades aren't the best, ask if you can do an additional project to improve your grade. Your teacher will be impressed by your initiative, and may treat you better as well.

, Although it's difficult to get past your own feelings sometimes, it's important to see if there is anything you can change. Are you late all the time? Do you forget to do your homework? Do you interrupt her when she is giving a lecture? Correct your behavior and your teacher will probably treat you better., If your teacher keeps calling on you and embarrassing you with difficult questions, try rephrasing the question before you answer it. She may not realize you don't understand the material – she might just think you haven't been doing the work.

"
Talk to your teacher.,
Get your parents involved.,
Keep a complaint log.,
Avoid starting a war.,
Be respectful.,
Accept that you won't get along with everyone.,
Keep things in perspective.",How to Deal With Annoying Teachers3," If you think your teacher treats you worse than other students, go to your teacher directly. There might be a simple miscommunication you can clear up, or an unhelpful behavior that one of you can change.Choose a time when neither of you is under pressure. Don't speak to him if there is a line of kids waiting to discuss their grade on a test, for example, or when the teacher is in a rush to prepare for a meeting.
If you are too intimidated to speak to your teacher alone, see if the school guidance counselor will join the conversation.

, If your teacher is doing something that you know the school or your parents would not approve of, you may need to ask your parents to intervene. For example, your teacher punishes the entire class with weekend detention for something only a few students (not you!) are doing.
Any time your teacher makes nasty comments to you or the class that involve race, gender, nationality, or anything of this nature.

, If you feel your teacher is truly out of hand, and not treating you fairly, you might try keeping a record of incidents as they happen. Write down any hurtful comments, along with the date, your side of the conversation. After you have a long list of complaints, you can go to a parent or the principal about it., It's natural to vent to your friends, and they will most likely agree with you. But if you stir things up, it is sure to get back to your teacher. This make things worse for you, and cause trouble for your friends, as well., Scowling, rolling your eyes, talking back, or walking off in the middle of a conversation will only make the situation worse – a lot worse. And you don't want to give your teacher anything they can complain about to your parents or the principal., Teachers are people, too. Sometimes personalities simply clash with each other – just as there are kids you get along with, and others you can't stand to be around. The best teachers are careful to treat all their students alike, but not all of them do.Be sure your parents are aware of the problem, in case your teacher complains to them about you.
Be as polite as possible, and try to get through each class without incident.

, You probably won't have to deal with this teacher next year. If you're in high school, this is just one hour out of your day. Although it is extremely annoying to deal with an annoying teacher, don't let it take over your life. When you're not in their class, try not to let it get you down."

Instead, try going to sleep at 11 o’clock, then 10 o’clock, and so on. It can take days or weeks to change your body’s natural rhythm. It’s important to begin adjusting your body a couple weeks before school starts.Give your body and mind plenty of time to adjust. Don’t start trying to adjust your sleep schedule two nights before school starts. You didn’t become a night owl overnight, so don’t expect to become a morning person overnight either! It takes time to reset your internal clock, so start a couple of weeks before the first day of school.;
, Different age groups have different sleep requirements. Children from 6 to 13 should be getting 9-11 hours of sleep nightly, while teenagers ages 14-17 need about 8-10 hours. Younger adults age 18-25 are recommended to receive about 7-9 hours., Exercising regularly is a great way to expend energy and ensure you sleep soundly at night. It can also help you fall asleep more quickly. Studies have shown that people who exercise at least 150 minutes a week also feel more alert and energized during their waking hours.Exercising late at night can energize you right before you need to be in bed. Try to work out in the mornings or early afternoons, and relax with more calming hobbies in the evening, such as reading.

, Not only can caffeine make it harder for you to fall asleep, but it can also make your sleep disruptive and uneasy. By avoiding caffeine completely, you can get the deep, restorative sleep that will set you up for a successful day. If you don’t want to cut out caffeine completely, at least try to avoid it up to six hours before bedtime., This means everything- phones, tablets, televisions, etc. These devices shine light into your eyes, which has been scientifically proven to promote wakefulness. Just as the sunset signals the end of the day, your electronics should go lights out too. A dark bedroom tells your brain that it is time to sleep., There are also free apps on smart phones that can provide white noise- just make sure the bright screen is off! Your brain craves stimulation, and it can be hard to turn that desire off at night. A white noise machine provides that stimulation, in a gentle and calming way. It also masks any bothersome noises from outside your bedroom that can keep you awake.You can play around with different white noise options such as thunderstorm, campfire, rain forest, and more.

, It is not easy to sleep if you are tossing and turning in a hot bedroom. As your body temperature lowers, your brain is told that it’s time to sleep. The best temperature for snoozing is anywhere from 60 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. If you aren’t in control of the thermostat, a ceiling fan or a portable fan can do the trick. A fan can also provide calming white noise.

, Just like you gradually scaled back your bedtime, you should do the same with your wake up time. Make it earlier in one hour increments gradually.


No matter how bad you want to hit snooze, don’t do it! It will only make waking up harder in the long run.

, This signals to your brain that it is time to wake up, and will help shake your feelings of grogginess. Open your curtains, turn on your lights, or even step outside. The bright light will perk you up and also can benefit your overall mood., It’s a pretty simple chore, yet so many people skip it. Not only does it start your day with a feeling of accomplishment, but it is much harder to crawl back into a neatly made bed. Do this enough, and it’ll become a habit.

, Your body can become dehydrated overnight, and this dehydration can increase your tiredness in the morning. By drinking a large glass of water first thing in the morning, you can restore some of the hydration you lost overnight and give yourself a quick, and easy, energy boost. Cold water can also increase adrenaline, which helps to wake you up., If you’re surrounded by silence, it’s easy (and appealing) to fall back asleep. You don’t need to play the peppiest music you can think of as loud as you possibly can. Just put on some music with upbeat melodies and positive lyrics, and it'll help you transition from zombie to human.Make a ""Rise & Shine"" playlist on your phone to pop on during your early mornings.

, If your blood sugar is low, your energy is low too. By eating a hearty meal in the morning, you are “breaking fast” and giving your body an energy boost in the morning.Try to eat healthy, nutrient-dense foods to promote stable energy levels. Sugary cereals and pastries may sound appealing, but they can cause a crash after the initial surge of energy., Get your body moving in the morning, however you can. If you have time to exercise in the morning, that’s great. If you don’t have time for a full workout, some gentle stretching can do the trick. By moving around and stretching out your body, you get your heart pumping and blood flowing to your brain.You may also get a burst of endorphins, the “feel good” chemicals that are released during physical exercise., It is normal to feel sleepy and lethargic while your body gradually gets used to your new schedule. However no matter how groggy you feel, don’t let yourself nap. Sleeping during the day will make it harder for you to fall asleep at night, and you’ll undo the hard work you did by waking up early."

Meet with other victims of abuse.",How to Deal With an Abusive Teacher," Some people may find it hard to define what verbal abuse is and will often dismiss harsh words as a form of tough love or as a strict teaching method. In some cases, people even give excuses as to why verbal abuse is acceptable. For example, verbally abusive teachers might blame a student's bad behaviour, attitude, or ineptitude to justify verbal abuse. Some examples of verbal abuse include:Belittling. This type of language ""puts down"" a victim and invalidates their opinions or feelings, making them feel insignificant and even stupid. Abusive teachers might say to you, ""You always have something to complain about"" or ""You're so stupid. You can't do anything"".Countering and correcting. Someone that is countering or correcting in an abusive manner will do anything to oppose the victim's reality, thoughts, and opinions - even when the victim is right. For example, if you confront an abusive teacher and tell them to stop, they might say, ""You're crazy. How am I abusing you?"" By denying their abusive actions and your feelings, abusive teachers remain in control over the situation and over you.

Abusive “jokes”. These jokes may be funny to others but they are often told at your expense. You may hear jokes making fun of your gender, your appearance, or your mental and physical capabilities. By making others laugh, an abuser maintains power and receives confidence and validation from others.

Holding out or being negligent. An abusive teacher might say to you, “I won’t pass you in this class if you don’t do this for me” or “I’m not letting you use the bathroom all day today”. Of course, this is different from a teacher refusing to give you a passing grade if you have been failing tests and assignments. Instead, you may be working just as hard as everyone else and doing all your work, but your teacher still refuses to give you a good mark or even teach you.

Calling you names. This type of verbal abuse is the easiest to recognize. If your teacher is calling you an idiot, bitch, slut, stupid, ugly, fat, or any inappropriate and hurtful name, then they are verbally abusing you.

Lashing out. If a teacher yells at you in a rage, screams at you, or throws a tantrum, then that is being verbally abusive. A teacher should never subject you to such intense emotional displays of frustration, which can cause fear and anxiety in you and other students.;
, Many schools and educational institutions will have policies against physical contact with students. Even though a teacher may not be physically touching you, there are other ways abusive teachers can be physically abusive. Physical abuse is defined by actions such as:Throwing, hitting, or slamming objects. Although the object may never touch you, using objects as things to throw around, slam, or hit can be abusive. For example, a teacher might throw their pencil across the room, slam their rulers against your desk, or kick a chair. All of these actions cause stress and induce fear.

Holding down, blocking, or pinning. An abusive teacher might put their hands on you and force you to stay in your seat, or block you from moving around with their body.

Use of weapons. An abusive teacher might threaten you with a weapon or use a weapon to hurt you. Weapons can be anything from rulers, pencils, books, to more obvious objects like knives, guns, and sticks.
Any type of physical contact that causes wounds, broken bones, falls, and bruises. A physically abusive teacher might hit you, choke you, or kick you.

, For many people, including children and adults, sexual abuse can be confusing. You may think you want it because you are aroused or that it feels good. However, teachers should never be sexual with their students. Even if both parties consent to sex or sexual acts, there are many policies and laws that define sexual acts between students and teachers as abuse.


For example, in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States of America, any form of sexual or romantic interaction between a teacher and student is seen as sexual misconduct. It does not matter the age of the student or whether there is verbal or written communication of consent. Any sexual or romantic interactions between a student and teacher is sexual misconduct and is subject to the criminal code.
Sexual abuse includes actions such as any sexual touching or intercourse, obscene phone calls or e-mails, exposure to pornography or nudity, sexual exploitation, and flirting or sexual language., Keeping a document of every time you experience any abuse from your teacher is extremely important. You may need to use this record as evidence in the future.


Record the date, time, place, and explain what happened exactly every time you experience abuse from your teacher.

, In some situations, you can avoid being alone with an abusive teacher. For example, they may ask to see you after class or give you detention. Avoid being alone with them by:


Lying about where you have to be. In these situations, lying is okay. Make up excuses like, “I have practice” or “I’m going to work after class” or “My parents are picking me up so I have to go tell them”.
Going to a place where your abusive teacher can’t find you. Try to find and plan to go to places where your teacher can’t find you or abuse you. For example, an abusive teacher would most likely not abuse you at the principal’s office.
Running away. If excuses don’t work, run. While you run, call for help and make as much noise as possible. Plan to escape in your car, in a taxi, or on a bus. If you are catch a bus or a taxi and you have no money, you can always explain to the driver that an abusive teacher is pursuing you and they will most likely try to help.

, In many cases, kidnappers, rapists, and abusers will lure their victims to a second, more private location in order to carry on larger and more fatal forms of abuse. If you are still at school, at least there are other teachers and students near you to hear or see any abuse that might happen to you. But if you move to a location that is off-site or out of campus, it’s very likely no one will be able to find you or know where you are. You may be scared to say no or you may be forced to follow an abusive teacher to a second location. Avoid being taken away by:


Making lots of noise. An abusive teacher might become even more angry and violent towards you if you make lots of noise. However, by making yourself heard, other people around you can come to your aid or you can scare off you teacher by being so loud and uncooperative.
Turning on your GPS on your phone. Many smartphones will have a built-in GPS or location service apps that track where your phone is. Ensure that you keep your phone on and with you at all times.
Calling emergency services. Being taken to another location against your will is a dangerous situation and emergency services should be contacted immediately.

, It is never too late to tell someone that a teacher is abusing you. A trusted person could be a friend, a family member, or an authority figure like another teacher, the principal, a guidance counsellor, or a school nurse. Abusers count on their victims to stay silent. They will find ways to make their victims feel helpless, alone, and undeserving of help. If you are experiencing this, it can be difficult to reach out to others about the abuse. There are many ways to tell someone you have been abused:Meet with the person one-on-one in a safe place. A safe place could be at your home, at their home, or in a quiet room where you feel comfortable expressing your emotions.
Take deep breaths before you speak to keep yourself calm. Breathing gives you something to focus on other than how you may be feeling. It can also help decrease your heart rate and ease discomforting feelings in your body.
Start by telling the person you have chosen that you have something to tell them. You can say, “I need to talk to you,” or “Something has happened to me that’s hard for me to talk about”.
You don’t have to explain in detail what happened to you. Instead, you can tell them, “I have been abused and it’s hard for me to tell you what happened. But I need help”.
If you know how you want the person to help you, tell them “I want you to…”.
Write a letter or send an e-mail or a text message if speaking to someone is too difficult for you.

, If you are not ready to talk to someone you know about the abuse you are experiencing or you don’t know who to trust, calling a hotline is an alternative way to tell someone about being abused. There are many hotline numbers that help victims cope with abuse. They will provide you with tools, resources, and even directly help you deal with an abusive teacher.


Speaking to someone about what you are experiencing can help make sense of what is happening. It can also relieve any fears, stresses, or anxieties that you may be feeling.
Most hotlines are toll-free and you can stay anonymous until you decide to disclose your identity. What you discuss during your phone call will be confidential.
Some organizations will have a place you can walk-in to receive help if talking on the phone is not something you want to do.

, In emergencies or dangerous situations, call emergency services for immediate help. For example, you could be in a dangerous situation if you are alone with your teacher and they are abusing you, or your teacher is becoming violent in class. Even if you can’t speak to the emergency dispatcher, dial the number and leave your phone on. The dispatcher may be able to hear what is going on and find out your location by tracing your call. Call again if the first call does not go through or you don’t receive help. The police can help you:Stop the abuse long enough for you to escape to a safe place or bring you to a safe place.
Arrest your abusive teacher for hurting you.
Report the abuse by interviewing you, taking pictures of you, and talking to witnesses like other students and teachers.

, Unfortunately, not all cries for help are heard. If you speak to someone and they don’t believe you, tell someone else. If police or emergency services don’t respond to your calls and claims, go to your local police station and find someone who is willing to listen.


Some educational institutions will go to great lengths to bury any evidence of ever having abusive teachers. It can be difficult to convince others that what you are experiencing or have experienced is true. You can always go to your local newspaper or to local law enforcements to make yourself heard. However, it is important that you understand the risks of exposing yourself and your experiences to the public before you go to such lengths.
It is not your fault if someone doesn’t believe you or you fail to tell someone about the abuse you are experiencing. You are not responsible for how someone reacts when you tell them about your abuse and what they say, think, or feel is not a complete or necessarily true reflection of what you are experiencing.

, Meeting and talking with a teacher that is physically or sexually abusive is not a good idea. Dire actions should be taken immediately and no amount of discussion will end the abuse.

, If you do choose to have a discussion with your teacher, be sure to have the conversation in front of someone you can trust, preferably an authoritative figure like a parent or a principal.


If you do not feel comfortable speaking to your teacher, have someone else do it for you.
Verbally abusive people and abusive people in general can be very manipulative. They may refuse to talk to you, deny their abuse, or shift blame to you. Having someone else there with you will decrease your chance of being further manipulated and perhaps illicit cooperation from your teacher.

, The last thing you want to do is aggravate or antagonize your teacher even more. Tell your teacher that the language they are using to speak to you is negatively affecting you and your classroom experience.


Avoid blaming the teacher.
Avoid threatening the teacher, especially with statements like “I’m going to sue you” or “I’m calling my lawyer”.
Take a cooperative approach.Perhaps there has been a misunderstanding between you and your teacher, or your teacher may soon realize their mistakes and change them.

, Speaking with the teacher about their verbal abuse against you may solve the problem. But not always. If things do not improve, ask a principal or other authoritative figure like a school board representative to intervene.


They will file a complaint or report against the teacher. This is an indirect message to the teacher that their abusive behaviour is not acceptable and they will be dealt with seriously.
You could request to the principal or other authoritative figure to separate you from the teacher. They may relocate you to a different class or excuse you from the course without penalty.

, A trained counsellor or therapist can help you navigate through your feelings. They can also come up with ways for you to cope and deal with the effects of abuse.


Your school or local organization that helps abuse victims can refer you to trusted counsellors and therapists.
It may take a few tries until you find the right counsellor or therapist for you.

, Writing down you feelings, your fears, and especially the happy things that happen everyday can be very therapeutic. Try writing exercises like:


Write down 5 things you are grateful for everyday.
Write about what you are looking forward to.
Write about your bad memories or experiences. Focus on describing your feelings. After you finish, you can choose to keep the entry or dispose of it by ripping it up or throwing it away. The act of getting rid of those entries can symbolize the act of ridding yourself of the negativity and abuse you had suffered.

, Walk with a friend or alone and use the time to let your mind wander. Take deep breaths and enjoy the scenery.


You can also run, job, or exercise. Being active, especially outside, can help you release any pent up or negative energy inside of you. It is also a good way to change your focus onto better things, even if it’s temporary.

, Surrounding yourself with people who care about you is a great reminder that you are loved and deserving of happiness. You can do activities like:


Watching movies at the theatre or at home.
Having dinner together.
Going on walks and hikes.
Playing team sports.
Talking on the phone.

, Meeting with people who understand how you feel and have gone through similar experiences as you can create a sense of unity and feelings of support. You can connect with others online through forums or meet them through support groups or organizations.


Meeting with other victims of abuse is not for everyone. It can be therapeutic or very triggering. Other people’s stories of abuse could be a form of relief or it could remind you of your own negative experiences.

Start with a clean slate.,
View it as a lesson.,
Separate the teacher from the subject.,
Be nice.,
Apply yourself.,
Choose your battles.",How to Deal With a Teacher You Dislike1," You may have heard rumors about the teacher you will have next year, but try your best not to let these stories influence your own opinion. If you start school thinking that you will hate your teacher, you probably will. If you go into it with an open mind, you're much more likely to get along with your teacher., You will not always get along with everyone you encounter in life, and that's okay! It's important to learn how to persevere and deal with people you don't like, so try to view this experience as an important life lesson that it will help you grow into a more successful adult.Remember that you don't have to like your teacher in order to learn from him/her. As long as you are still doing well in the class, do your best to deal with your teacher.If the problem is affecting your grade or causing you to dislike school, it may not be worth it to just stick it out.

, Before you decide you don't like your teacher, it's important to think carefully about what exactly your problem is. If you happen to hate math, it may be that you really don't have a problem with the teacher, but instead with the subject matter. This is an important distinction because getting a new teacher will not help your situation if you hate the subject.If you're struggling with a subject, ask your teacher for extra help or get a tutor. Once you understand the subject matter a little better, you might find that your teacher really isn't so bad after all.
Try to find something that interests you about the subject and focus on that as much as possible. If you have the option to choose your own reading or research material, make sure it's something that interests you enough to keep you engaged in the class.Remind yourself that even if you don't like a certain subject, your grade is still important. Stay focused on doing your best, even if you don't think you'll ever use anything you learned in this class in the real world., If you think your teacher is being mean to you, you might be tempted to be mean right back to her, but this will only make the situation worse! You don't need to be overly cheery when you talk to your teacher, but always be pleasant and respectful. You may find that your good attitude will rub off on your teacher., If you feel that part of the problem may be that your teacher doesn't like you, try making a little extra effort in class to turn the relationship around. This means showing up on time, doing your homework, being attentive, and asking questions.Be proactive about making up missed work and letting your teacher know if you will be missing school.
Don't suck up too much. This will not seem genuine.

, It's important not to be too argumentative with your teacher, as this will only worsen your relationship. It's okay to confront her about grades you don't understand, but don't be confrontational about it, and don't argue over every single point."
"
Have a talk with your teacher.,
Talk to other students.,
Talk to your counselor.,
Get your parents involved.,
Choose reassignment as a last resort.",How to Deal With a Teacher You Dislike2," If you're really having a hard time learning because of your teacher's teaching style, consider having an open conversation with her about it. Let her know what specifically is bothering you and see if she can make some adjustments to help you learn better.For instance, if you think your teacher is too harsh of a grader, you might want to ask for some tutoring or study tips. If she speaks too quickly, find an appropriate time to talk to the teacher and kindly ask if she could speak slower because you've been having trouble understanding.
If there's something going on in your personal life that is affecting you at school, let your teacher know about it. She may be much more understanding of your behavior if she understands where it's coming from.Only talk to your teacher about things that can be changed. It might help to have a conversation about comments on your homework that you don't understand, but it will not be productive to tell your teacher that you think she's mean and unfair.
Instead of just blaming the teacher for the problem. show that you're willing to work together to fix it.

, If there are other students in the class who seem to be getting along with the teacher and doing well in the class, talk to them about their strategy. Ask them if they have encountered any of the same problems you are dealing with, and if so, what they did about it. They may have some useful tips for how to get better grades or get on this teacher's good side., Your school counselor is there to help you deal with all sorts of problems, both in and out of school. Your counselor can work with you to help you understand why you don't like your teacher and what you might be able to do to improve the situation.In some cases, your counselor might have a talk with you and your teacher or might recommend that you be reassigned to another class, but don't go into the meeting expecting these results.

, Let your parents know how you feel about your teacher, but be sure to explain exactly why you feel that way. They may be able to offer you some good perspective and advice on how to deal with the situation.It may help to have your parents help you write down a list of things you dislike about your teacher. This can help you figure out what you can talk to the teacher about.
If it has gotten to the point that you feel you are unable to manage the situation with your teacher, you can ask your parents to have a meeting with her. If that doesn't go well and your parents believe that your teacher is being unreasonable, they can go to the principal or superintendent.

, If you have exhausted all of your other options and you truly believe that your schoolwork is being affected by your bad relationship with your teacher, ask to be reassigned to another class.Keep in mind that conflict resolution is a very important skill. You will be depriving yourself of learning how to deal with tough situations if you request a reassignment without trying to work things out first

Determine why they creep you out.,
Trust your instincts.,
Ensure your teacher maintains professional boundaries.,
Be aware of being groomed.,
Be aware of power-abusing behaviors.",How to Deal With a Teacher That Creeps You Out1," Figure out what it is about their behavior that bothers you. Pay attention to your teacher’s behavior and your reactions to it the next time you are in class to see if there is a pattern.


Does the teacher invade your personal space? Does the teacher make comments about your appearance? Does the teacher seem to favor you or another student in a class in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable?
Find out if anyone else in your class is made uncomfortable by your teacher, and see if you can figure out the reason behind your discomfort. Make sure you do this away from your classroom.;
, It is hard sometimes to find the words for what is making you uncomfortable, but you may know on some level that the behavior isn’t right. Sometimes you can feel a tension or discomfort somewhere in your body when someone does or says something “off.” Pay attention to that feeling and do not dismiss it, even if the teacher’s behavior appears friendly.Attention from a teacher can be flattering. But trust your instincts. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. And if it feels off or uncomfortable in any way, it probably is.

, While some students like it when their teacher takes on more of a “friend” role than that of a mentor or educator, understand that this is not always appropriate. While a student may push those boundaries by trying to get closer to a teacher, it is the teacher’s responsibility to enforce those boundaries.


The teacher should not be alone with a student in a hidden area. The teacher can have a private conversation with a student with the classroom door open or while visible to other teachers and students.
The teacher should not be friends with a student on social media, unless the account the teacher is using is a separate account for school or students.The teacher’s relationship to the student should be confined to school activities., Grooming refers to taking interest in an individual in order to manipulate them for sexual abuse purposes. The abuser makes their target feel special, and often manipulates them with gifts or favors to maintain a level of secrecy about their relationship. This manipulates the person to stay quiet about potential abuse.If your teacher has taken a personal interest in you, be very wary. Do not accept gifts or favors from the teacher. Refuse to keep any secrets about your relationship. You could say to your teacher, “I’m sorry, but I don’t feel comfortable accepting this gift.”Talk to another adult right away if you are afraid you, or another classmate, are being manipulated by your teacher. Do not be afraid to speak up. You are not doing anything wrong by voicing your concern.
You could say to your guidance counselor or dean, “I’m concerned about how Mrs. Jones is treating a student in class. The student seems to be getting special treatment and it’s making me feel uncomfortable.”

, Teachers are in a position of power over their students, which can be intimidating and make students reluctant to speak up. Certain inappropriate behaviors need to be reported to your parent, dean, or principal immediately. These include:


Harassment of or discrimination against a student because of their race, religion, sexuality, gender, or disability.
Unwanted physical contact (either sexual or aggressive in nature).
Grading students on something other than their academic performance.
Acting out in the classroom by throwing things or losing their temper."
"
Film or document the teacher’s inappropriate behavior.,
Talk to your parents.,
Discuss your concerns with an administrator at your school.,
Find out the next steps.",How to Deal With a Teacher That Creeps You Out2," If you need evidence to support your claims, use your phone to take a video of your teacher’s behavior in class. If this is impossible (if the behavior is hard to see, or if it happens too fast for you to film it), write down all of the incidents in detail. Make sure you note the date and time of the incident.If there are other students in your class who have noticed your teacher’s problem behavior, ask them to keep their phones accessible to help you document incidents.

, Let your parents know what you are seeing in your classroom and how it makes you feel. Discuss with your parents what you would like them to do.Have your parent email the teacher with their concerns. If that doesn’t resolve the issue, have them meet with the teacher. Make sure your parents stay calm during the meeting and do not approach the teacher in anger.If you are concerned that your parents contacting your teacher will result in repercussions for you, have your parents contact the principal. It might be a good idea to come along to the meeting if you feel comfortable, so you can describe the situation in your classroom.

, If your parents do not get involved, speak to your guidance counselor, a dean, or the principal. If you still do not feel listened to, write a letter to your school board.You can ask that your name not be identified to the teacher. Whether this will be honored, however, may depend on the policies of your school district.
Explain the problem respectfully and state only the facts. Try to keep your emotions out of it. For example, saying “Mr. Esposito is horrible! He makes me sick!” doesn’t let anyone know what’s going on. Instead, say something like “Mr. Esposito has made comments to several of the girls in my class about their clothing. He told two girls their jeans were tight and another girl that her skirt was ‘too long for her.’”

, Ask your school administrator what will happen after you make the report. What will happen depends on the severity of your accusation, as well as the policies your school currently has in place.


Ask for an expected timeline. For example, “When can I follow-up with you about this conversation today? When do you expect to move forward on this?”
Discuss how you would like to see the situation resolved. Do you want the teacher to be disciplined? Would you be comfortable in their classroom if they stopped the problem behavior? Let the administrator know what you would like to see happen."
"
Try to get along with the teacher.,
Focus on the bigger picture.,
Keep your distance.,
See if you can switch classes.",How to Deal With a Teacher That Creeps You Out3," You don’t have to like the teacher, you just have to deal with them. If you have reflected on your teacher’s behavior and you have determined it is just a personality conflict, understand that this is how life works sometimes. There will be many people in your life you have to deal with who you won’t like. Consider this practice for adulthood, when you will have to work with people you don’t like, or may have a supervisor who is unfair, or need to get along with your in-laws.Be civil to your teacher. Even if you don’t like them, there is no excuse to be impolite. Say please and thank you, and do not give them an attitude.
If you want to debate the teacher in a class discussion, make sure you use a calm, warm tone of voice that does not convey anger. A good teacher will encourage classroom debate and discussion. You could say, “Mrs. Lawrence, when I read that story, I thought differently. To me, it seemed like the character….”

, Get motivated to be successful. What is the goal you are working toward in your education? Maybe you are working toward a career goal, or college, or excellent grades to get into an elite university. Whatever your goal, focus on how success in this class will help you to achieve it.


Complete your assignments, study hard, and do your best in the class in spite of a personality conflict. Think of your success in their classroom as a way to not let your teacher get the better of you.

, Try to keep space between you and the teacher. If your teacher comes close to you, step back. An aware teacher will note your reaction and will correct their body language to make sure you are comfortable. If the teacher doesn’t, find an administrator with whom you can address your concern.If your teacher is talking to you too closely, take a step or two back. If the teacher moves toward you again, you could say, “I’m sorry, I’m just weird about my personal space. Could you give me some more room, please?”

, If you are still finding your classroom environment intolerable, talk to your guidance counselor about switching classes. See if you can find another teacher who teaches the same subject, or see if you can change to a different subject entirely.


Be respectful about your problems with your teacher. You could say, “I’ve had a difficult time getting along with Mr. Roberts this year. He is a good teacher, but I think we have a personality conflict. Would it be possible to switch into Mrs. Ramos’ geometry class instead?”

Get fit.,
Take care of your teeth.,
Wash your face.",How to Get Ready to Go Back to School (Girls)," You want to find outfits that are cute and comfortable. You'll need a good mix of clothes, because you don't want to wear the same thing more than one time a week. If you wear a uniform, make sure your outfits are in good condition. Since you'll be wearing them a lot, you want them to fit well and not have any rips or stains.;
, Accessories add personality to any outfit, especially a school uniform. Get some earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and rings. You could also get some cute scarves and belts.

, When school starts, you'll want to have plenty of fresh makeup. During the summer, you can experiment with different types of makeup to figure out what style you like best. For school, you'll want a natural, polished look.

, Do you like to wear it straight, or curly? Do you want to wear it down, or pulled back? Don't think that you have to wear your hair the same way you wore it last year. If you've been thinking about getting a new haircut or getting highlights, go for it! Also, learn a new way to braid or pull back your hair. When school comes around, you can wear a different style every day! Remember, hair accessories such as clips and headbands can help you look great without much effort.

, This doesn't necessarily mean lose weight. If you actually are overweight, the summer is a great time to start exercising and eating well. But if you are already at a healthy weight, you don't need to lose any more. If you simply eat healthy foods and exercise for sixty minutes a day, you can replace body fat with muscle, making you stronger.

, You might want to get them whitened before school starts to brighten your smile. Make sure to brush at least twice a day, and floss at least once a day.

",How to Get Ready for the First Day of School (Girls)," If you prefer to shower at night, go ahead and do so.


Shave: While you are in the shower, shave your under-arms and legs. If you wax your arms and legs, then do this one or two days before school starts so that your skin has time to settle and doesn't look red.
Use a quality shampoo made specially for your hair type (oily, dry, limp, etc.), and a quality conditioner.
Wash your body with a scented body-wash or soap.
If possible, air-dry your hair and gently pat your skin dry.
Apply a quality moisturizer after the shower. This is optional, as most young skin does not need moisturizing.;
, First, wash with warm water to open your pores, Then use a cleanser, and after, try an exfoliating scrub or a mud mask. Sugar can be a great for exfoliating and softening skin.Instead of using your normal moisturizer, you could use olive oil or jojoba oil., If you use whitening strips, put them on now but talk to your parents about this first, as whiteners contain a lot of chemicals that they might not consider appropriate for your age. Don't forget to floss.

, Apply any hair care products you normally use.

, Also, if you prefer to carry a purse, then pack that as well.

,,, If you did shower, at least wipe your face clean.

, For example, toast with peanut butter and a glass of orange juice is a healthy, well-balanced option.

, Then use a toner to even out and moisturize your skin.

, Avoid having food stuck in your teeth for the first day of school.

,, If you are younger, then stick with neutral, or light pink eye-shadow. Also apply mascara, lip balm, and lip gloss. Apply concealer to cover any imperfections. Going without makeup is perfectly fine too.


Are you not allowed to wear makeup? Use tinted lip balm or simply appreciate the fact that youth ensures that you're beautiful.

,, Earrings, necklaces, or bracelets add a nice touch to your outfit.

, In case you sweat, you don't want to smell bad. Bring a trial/travel size with you to school.

Consider letting someone else do the shopping. Use a service like educate where you pay a flat fee to have all your child's supplies delivered to his/her classroom on the first day of class.





;
, Instead of buying things all willy-nilly, make a plan -- see what fits and is still fashionable from last year. Look for ""holes"" in the wardrobe (in other words, what's missing), and shop accordingly. You'll save time, money and stress.

, To keep the first week of school stress-free, plan out five cute outfits. Make sure they're comfortable and you like them.

, Try to organize your closet and to keep it organized. Try using labels, bins, or shelves.

, What worked last year (in terms of homework and studying) may not be a perfect fit this year. Be open to new ideas and be willing to make adjustments as necessary.

, Many students find it helpful to have a desk stuffed with supplies in a quiet place. That way, they have somewhere peaceful and well-stocked to work. Set up study station long before school starts.

, If you're a student about to enter into first-year french, consider buying a phrasebook or dictionary and doing a little studying before the course actually begins. You may also find it helpful to brush up on previous knowledge that may help you in this year's classes.

, It's important that a student has a healthy and tasty lunch packed when they go to school. That way, they won't eat cafeteria food or things from vending machines; those are high in calories and low in nutrition. If you're a student, work out a healthy meal plan for yourself, or if you're the parent, make sure you pack nutritious things for your children.

, It only takes a few minutes to ensure that things are running smoothly and to make any necessary adjustments. It doesn’t have to be anything as formal as a “family conference,” rather, it can be as simple as a five-minute conversation with your student and a quick room inspection.

Try to ignore it.,

Discuss the situation with your guidance counselor.,
Talk to your principal.,
Bring backup to the confrontation.,
Have evidence of bullying.,
Remain calm during the confrontation.,
Talk directly to the teacher who is bullying you.,
Think about how your teacher’s actions make you feel.,
Look for a pattern.,
Try to recognize the difference between not getting your way and being bullied.,
Consult an online checklist about whether or not you’re being bullied.",How to Deal With Bullying Teachers," If you feel like you’re being bullied by a teacher, there is a possibility that you are blowing the situation out of proportion. Give yourself a little time to cool down. Ignore the teacher as much as possible without being blatantly rude and see what happens.If the bullying continues, then you should consider doing something about it.;
, If the bullying is really bothering you, tell your parents. You might be a little nervous to talk to them about this, but just tell them what happened. Your parents will care and will want to help you.If you feel that you aren't up to the task of bringing your teacher down, ask them to talk to him/her in your presence. There is nothing “weak” in recognizing yourself as not willing to make a teacher your direct enemy., If you are being bullied by your teacher and you want this to stop, you’ll need to start gathering evidence. Every time something happens that makes you feel bad or afraid, write it down. Describe the situation, the events that happened, how it made you feel, and include the date and time of the incident., If you have a class teacher, do not be afraid of telling him or her. Another teacher will be better equipped than you to know what to do next. They will be able to guide you through the next steps.If your class teacher is the one who is bullying you, consider telling another teacher that you are close to about the problem.

, Most schools have guidance counselors whose job it is to handle situations like this. If you are being bullied by a teacher, make an appointment with your guidance counselor to talk about it. They’ll talk to you about what the teacher is doing, how it makes you feel, and what can be done to resolve the situation.This is also a good idea because the guidance counselor will likely know the teacher who is bullying you, so they’ll be able to give you sound advice based on their personal knowledge.

, Inform your principal about the bullying you are experiencing from a teacher. Make an appointment with your principal to talk about why this situation is upsetting you.But remember, since informing your principal could lead to severe consequences for the teacher in question, you should only take this step as a last resort.

, If you are nervous about confronting the teacher alone, ask your parents, the principal, or another teacher to go with you when you talk to them. This should help prevent any future bullying and make you more confident about the outcome of your confrontation., If there is any evidence of the bullying, bring it with you when you confront the teacher. The stronger your case is, the more likely the teacher will be to see your side of the story (or at least they might be too scared to do it again).


Maybe your teacher made some rude comments on one of your homework assignments. Or maybe your teacher wrote something mean about you on the board and you took a picture of it. Whatever evidence you may have to prove that you accusations are true, bring it.

, When a kid confronts an adult, the kid is usually at an immediate disadvantage due to the age difference. If you get upset and start crying hysterically, it will only confirm their suspicion that you are just an emotional child blowing things out of proportion.Stay calm and try not to cry or yell. This will make you look more mature and will help the other adults to believe you.
If you are so upset that you cannot talk without crying or yelling, have one of the adults with you talk to the teacher for you.

, Try doing this after class so it doesn’t make a scene, if possible. The teacher's staff room is good if the other teachers like you, but be careful: if you put the teacher in an uncomfortable position, they may take out all of their frustration on you.


You can simply ask them outright: “Sir/Ma’am, I feel like you are bullying me and I would like to know why.”
Try to have a calm conversation and tell them how you feel. They might not even realize that they have made you feel this way. In this case, a simple conversation should resolve your problems.
If the teacher is defensive or denies what you say, this is when it will be good to have your parents or the principal on your side.

, A big part of determining whether or not you are being bullied is by reflecting on how your interactions with that person make you feel. If you feel anxious, isolated, put down, humiliated, etc., then you are probably being bullied., Bullying happens when someone treats you poorly over and over. If your teacher makes you upset one time, that doesn’t really count as bullying. Think back over your interaction with your teacher and consider if there have been repeated instances when they made you feel bad or afraid., Sometimes teachers have to discipline students or make them do things they don’t want to do. This is part of their job and isn’t considered bullying as long as they make the entire class do the same thing.


The key here is identifying whether your teacher is singling you out and treating you differently than the other students. If your teacher is punishing only you or making mean comments to you in front of others, this is bullying.

, There are many checklists/quizzes online that give you a list of questions to ask yourself about being bullied. If you answer yes to any of the questions, it is probable that you are being bullied.


Try using the checklist quiz from Pacer Center’s Teens Against Bullying."

Just like middle school, some of your friends will be going to different high schools, and some may have moved out of your state or country. If you have a sister or brother who has attended, you may want to ask about how people are at your new school.;
, This is an important discussion topic. Tell your friends that as much as you like them, you will be open to new friendships in high school, you will meet new people, but that this won't necessarily impact your friendship. Tell your friend(s) that they are welcome to make new friends as well, and everyone can hang out together. This may be hard for a close group of friends because they are so used to staying together, so remember to have this chat.

, This can be through social media sites and/or through other friends, it is easy to find some of the classmates you might have in the upcoming year. If your friend knows them, or talks to them, try to organize a date where you can all hang out together so you can get to know them. Developing new friendships before high school starts can calm the nerves of the first day, knowing you are not alone. You obviously won't get to know everyone, but that's part of the fun!

, On the first day of high school (or orientation day) you will be faced with other students you may not know, as well as new teachers. This is when first impressions are established. Remember to keep an open mind and stick by a friend as you are meeting others.

, Entering high school can take quite a toll on the nerves. It is important to calm yourself down. Focus on the positives. High school is an exciting new experience. It is an opportunity to meet a diverse set of people and take elective classes that interest you. You will be able to join clubs, sports teams, and meet new people.

, In a crowded room of students, something that stands out about a person is their confidence and pride. If you are not already confident, now will be the time to practice. People who are confident create a great mood and seem more inviting. If this is not you and you prefer to be independent, make sure you are not too self-doubting, and let your personality shine through. People who are true to themselves tend to attract others. Practice your confidence by realizing your strengths (think of a happy time, or an award you won, a team you were part of, and hold on to that thought) and admiring yourself. Practice a strong smile and good posture.

, Even though summer is the time to have fun with friends and family, remember to sleep well. Sleep plays a very important role in your growth and development. Sleep deprivation can cause fatigue and dark circles under your eyes, which would not help your appearance or health. Some suggestions are listed below.

Work out. Do earlier in the day and not before bed, as this can cause insomnia.
Relax. Read more about how to relax here.

, Some good suggestions are:

School supplies (pencils, pencil crayons, erasers, binders, paper, binder dividers, etc)
Cell phone (make sure this doesn't distract you, though!)
Emergency protection (girls): pads/tampons
Unscented (some schools have no scent policies) deodorant.

, Here are good suggestions:

Bathe
Shave
Brush your teeth
Brush your hair
Also, waking up early for school should be practiced about a week before school starts. So, the week before school, gradually set your alarm earlier and earlier each day. At night, set a sleep schedule that guarantees you at least eight hours of sleep.

, Summer should be the time to get on that healthy-diet and this doesn't necessarily mean to lose weight, it means to eat healthy. Look over the Health Guide and make sure you get all your servings, with the proper amount of each food group. Nutrition plays an important role in keeping you in shape, and keeping your face clean. Remember, eating right makes a difference! Moderate on foods filled with empty calories and try to limit consumption of fizzy drinks. Go grocery shopping with your parents/guardian/sibling and choose some fruits and vegetables you love. Make it a routine to eat healthy! Remember to drink lots of water to stay hydrated and keep your body healthy and energetic!

, Something you should practice all year round is great hygiene. A person who is clean and presentable is more attractive than a person who is dirty and doesn't take care of themselves. Make sure to shower regularly and invest in a body scrub to make sure your body is clean. Work a good shampoo into your hair and check frequently for oily hair and dandruff. If you have facial skin problems, make sure you have some treatment for that (daily cleanser, moisturizer, cream, Proactive) and make sure to use it! Also, put some body cream/lotion on your elbows and knees, which get dry often. And don't forget your deodorant!


Make sure your nails and toenails are properly cut, and cleaned. You may manicure them if you like! Just make sure they are presentable, people notice your nails more often than you think.

, Boys may like to style their hair with gel or a blow-drier. Girls may like to straighten their hair, curl it, or just put some mousse in it. Remember to avoid hair products with a very heavy smell. Overall, minimize the amount of different scents. When using heat tools, always use a heat protectant.

, Remember to choose a light perfume scent and spray it before heading out the door each morning or whenever necessary. If you have a small bottle or sample bottle you can take with you and keep in your pencil-case or locker that would be good. Boys may want to use cologne. Know your school's policy, though! Some have a No Scent policy.

It is a good idea to keep a perfume bottle at home and a small body mist or spray bottle at school. Body mists and sprays have a more refreshing scent for when you start to sweat or after lunch but they do not last at long. You can apply often during the day and they are much cheaper than perfumes. You can find them at stores like Bath and Body works where they often have sales. Keep a body mist/spray in your bag. It is also good idea to keep a deodorant with you at school.

, Teeth are very important because you need them to show off a good smile! Practice good dental heath during the summer by going to the dentist, brushing for two minutes twice a day, flossing then using a rinse (like Listerine) to freshen your breath.


If you need whiter teeth, consider whitening strips, whitening toothpaste, natural remedies, or see your dentist. Always keep a pack of gum in your bag. Try to stick to minty flavors that will give you fresh breath, instead of candy-flavors that make your teeth weird colors and do not last long. Try not to show-off that you have gum because your pack will end before you know it. Keep one in your bag and one in your locker, just to make sure.

, Remember to apply cream/moisturizer/cleanser on the first day of school if you need it, in the morning. Also, before doing your makeup, put any necessary cream under to protect your face. Do not overdo it with the makeup because it is not necessary and you might stand out in a negative way. Stick to some light foundation if you need it, 1 coat of mascara and a light lip gloss or lipstick. If you want a little shine, some chap-stick or Vaseline will do the trick.


Accessorize with small earrings, a necklace, or a bracelet. Do not overdo the jewelry either. Choose a nice tote-bag to keep all your materials in (folder, files, pencil case, notebook, wallet). Remember to do your nails or clean them and leave them as they are. You can even just paint a clear coat on them if you like. If the weather permits, accessorize with a scarf.
Keep a small bag of makeup with you, just in case. A small mirror would be a good thing to have. Do a quick check in front of the mirror before leaving for school.
Shower and shave. Remember that while you are in the shower, or wherever you are comfortable, don't forget to shave/wax your legs/underarms if you usually do so.

, Remember to give yourself a good shower before starting school and get a haircut about 1 week (or sooner) before if you need it. It makes a big difference if you have done something with your hair, because it shows that you care. Look up some styles on YouTube or Google to get ideas for what you would like done.


For boys, if you have strong facial hair, shave to your liking, but you may choose to keep it. Give yourself a spray of cologne before you leave and throw in the deodorant as well. Remember to wash or freshen your shoes if you need to and wear clean clothing (if you don't have a uniform). Also, make sure your backpack has everything you need (forms, pencils and pens).

, If you cannot, refer to step 2. During open house, a week or so before school starts, you may be given a map around the school. If so, make sure to view it over the weekend before you start school.

, At open houses, you will likely be given your schedule. If you feel like you may get lost, look around the school and practice the route you will take.


Go in the order of what classes you will normally go to, and make sure you know where the important things are like your locker (if you have one), the cafeteria, the office, vending machines, and the bathrooms.

, A few nights before school, go over your schedule and memorize which class you will be going to, remember your teachers' names, and if you think you will need them, then the room numbers too.


Practice this in order while imagining the route you will make to each.
You want to be prepared so you will not get lost or have trouble finding where each classroom is.

, Learn in depth the sports there, the clubs you can join, any traditions the school is familiar with, and ask them about your teachers if they had them.


You can also ask them about the first day there, if it makes you feel better.
Make sure you are learning important things that will help you better transition into your new school.

,, Check to see if you will be taking any classes together.


You can also ask them if they know anything important or interesting about the class or teacher.

, Find out why they are taking them and communicate back to them in the same way.


You may need to know more about it in the future, especially if its a required course to graduate. Keep yourself updated on what your friends say about it.

, Try to get to know this person, or at least ask about them.


You should also communicate how you and your friends can stay in touch at other times at school such as at lunch or extra curricular activities.

, Express what interests you have and see if you want to join the club. Find out if you know anyone else who will be joining.


Plan to join a club or sport if you want to be more active and meet new people. If you have no classes with them, this is a great opportunity to share time together without planning to meet up.

, In high school the classes and periods are so broken up that you may never have a class with someone in your grade.


If you do not want this to limit you, consider a club or sport to join, and getting to know them outside of school if you like.

Getting all worked up about the situation will solve nothing and will only make you feel worse. Take a few deep breaths and look at the other teachers you have been assigned, as well.However, if you feel the urge to cry, take a few moments to yourself to let it out but don’t allow yourself to get caught up in the stress.;
, Rather than allowing yourself to become overly upset, put this school year and this teacher in perspective. Remember that it’s just one year or one semester and just one class. This class will take up a relatively small amount of your day; remember that.


Also think about why you dislike your teacher in the first place. If you dislike them because of things that you have heard, these things could be untrue and you may actually enjoy the teacher.

, Don’t allow this new information to ruin your day. Whether you received your schedule on the day that classes begin or a few weeks in advance, take a few moments to distract yourself from this newfound information. Wallowing won’t change anything and will only make you feel more worse, so take some time away from this stress.


Call a friend you can laugh with.
Play a game on your phone.
Listen to music you enjoy.

, Don’t allow yourself to get so upset that you let go of the things you love to do. During the days leading up to school and even after you begin, continue to do the things that you enjoy. This will give you something to look forward to after a potentially difficult day at school. Never let go of your passions just because you have received some bad news.


Continue your hobbies like playing piano or playing soccer.

, Your parents have probably had a teacher that they hated a time or two. Talk to them about what they did to deal with that and about your feelings for this teacher. They have encountered many of the problems that you are now facing, so never forget to rely on them for help.


You can also talk to a school counselor. They are there to help you navigate any issues that you should have, so rely on them for issues like this.
You might begin the conversation by saying “Hey Mom and Dad, I have this teacher this school year who I really dislike. I’m nervous about the school year and don’t really know how I’m going to handle this. Do you have any advice on dealing with teachers you don’t like?”

, Even though this is difficult, you must prepare for this teacher’s class just as you would any other class. Check the materials list for this teacher and purchase all of the required items. Make sure you are prepared for the first day of class so that you have no issues.


If there are any readings you are assigned before your first class, be sure to do them.

, Though this should be a last resort, know that you can also have your class schedule changed in certain cases. In most schools, classes are changed in the Guidance Office, but you can also go to the school secretary so they can direct you to the proper office. However, you should know that you may be unable to switch out of the class, so don't get your hopes up, and use this only as a last resort.

, Though this news is certainly not the best, focus on all of the things about this school year that will be positive for you. Allowing yourself to focus on the positives of the situation prevent you from sinking into despair about your teacher. Always operate out of a positives based mindset rather than negatives and your outlook about things in the future will remain joyful.


If your close friends are in many of your classes, be grateful for that.
Perhaps this is your senior year and you’re excited about all of the fun times that you’ll be having before college.
Maybe you got some new clothes that you’re pumped to wear on your first few days of school.

, In reality, the teacher may not be as bad as you are thinking. Take some time to find out good things about your teacher so you can feel more positive about taking a course with them. Make sure to avoid operating off of rumors or assumptions about the teacher.


For instance, if your teacher just looks or appears to be mean or stern, this could be misleading. Allow their actions to paint a more truthful picture not dictated by appearances.
If your friends don’t offer any positive comments about the teacher, challenge them to come up with at least one.

, Even though you may have been assigned this one teacher that you dislike, this is likely not the only teacher that you will have for the year. If you are in middle or high school, you probably have three or more other teachers. Take some time to think about them and what you know about them. Maybe you have one of the best math teachers in the school; you should celebrate that more than feeling upset about having the teacher you hate.

, Then, use what you know about your teacher to model your behavior in their class. If you know that this teacher, for instance, is very strict and reports a lot of students to the principal, you can prepare by making a promise to yourself to stay out of trouble completely in their class. The difference between this teacher and the others are your schedule is that you perhaps know more about them than the others, and can prepare, respond, and act accordingly.


Don't blindly believe everything you hear about your teacher, though. Keep your eyes open - they might end up being your favorite teacher once you get to know them and their teaching style more.

, Though it can be difficult to resist, don’t gossip or speak poorly about your teacher if you can help it. Negative talk only fuels more negative feelings, and if you truly want to make the best of the situation, badmouthing your teacher will never help. Remember the popular phrase that your parents may have told you: If you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything at all.


If the teacher does something that is inappropriate or out of line, however, you should tell another teacher, the principal, or your parents.

, Before the class begins, you will likely be feeling nervous, agitated or perhaps even angry. Take a few moments to yourself to meditate and breathe deeply, or get a few sips of water. Taking some time to assure that you are calm before you enter a stressful situation can make a world of difference on your mood in the class.


When meditating, you might say something to yourself like “I will have a positive attitude in class. I will have a good day. I will not allow anyone to take my peace and joy.”
You might want to go to the restroom for a few minutes so you can be alone with your thoughts, or if possible, take a few moments to be outside.
Write down a few quotes that you like about being calm or dealing with difficult situations on notecards and keep them in your pocket or in your notebook to remind you to be positive and strong throughout the day.

, Everyday of your life, no matter if it is a regular day or a day of extreme importance, you should work to make the day a good one. Good days can sometimes just happen but often they are fostered by a positive attitude and a grateful heart. Remember to stop and smell the roses and to not let anxiety rule you. You are responsible for your own happiness.Jot down a list of things you are grateful for each morning.
Pay someone you love or like a compliment.
Take a nice walk or go for a run.
Listen to your favorite music dance in your room.
Spend time with your family and friends.
Exercise so you feel great every day.
Develop any of your other hobbies further, like playing piano perhaps.

, The moment you see your new teacher as you are about to begin their class, be sure to have the most positive attitude possible. They will sense any negativity in you and may reciprocate it, so to prevent that, be mindful of your attitude. Model positive body language by keeping your posture upright and not sitting with your arms folded.


Smile. A smile can go a very long way, even with someone you dislike. Smile at your teacher when you see them, even if your smile is only slight., In the mornings when you greet them with a smile, be sure to tell them “hello” or “good afternoon” as well. Ask them questions about your assignments or projects. Ask them for advice about what colleges to apply to as your relationship progressively improves and becomes more friendly. Treating your teacher more like a person than an enemy is a great way to become more positive.You can also try to have a talk with them if you have had any issues in the past. Perhaps you don’t like this teacher because you got into an argument a while ago. Do your best to resolve this so you can move forward.
If you have fought with your teacher, you might start the conversation by saying “I wanted to let you know that I was nervous when I found out you were my teacher because of what happened between us a while ago. However, I know that a part of becoming an adult is being mature and facing your problems head on. I am hoping you and I can move forward and I commit to being a good student while I have you as a teacher.”

, Come to class on time every day and always be in your seat when the bell rings. Go to tutoring if you are struggling in the class and study the material in your spare time so you will perform well on tests and classwork. Show genuine interest in the material presented by engaging when the teacher is teaching and asking questions. If your teacher feels that you are making an effort to do well, your relationship will improve.

, Review your teacher’s specific conduct policies for their classroom, which is often posted somewhere in the room and reviewed on the first day of class. Though there are school rules that every student must abide by, your teacher often has a separate set that they find beneficial to enforce. Be sure to not break any of the rules your teacher has laid out for you so you can avoid unnecessary punishment.


For instance, if your teacher has a rule against getting up before the bell rings or chewing gum, be sure not to do those things.

, Though this step may be the most difficult of all, it can go a very long way in shifting your relationship between you and your teacher. Often times, we are so focused on disliking people that we can sometimes everything they do as evil, even if their actions are not always bad, and they may have similar feelings about us. Take some time to do something thoughtful for your teacher to show them that you are making an effort to shift the dynamic between the two of you.This could be something small like opening the door for them or helping them with their bags or something larger like buying them a small gift for Teacher’s Appreciation Day. Either way, your actions will be appreciated and they will begin to treat you kinder since you have done so with them.

Have fun!",How to Get Ready for Middle School (Girls)," Look for school rules, enrollment dates, teachers names, etc. If you already know what class you are in, look for your teacher's name--so you will go into the classroom knowing how to greet your teacher.;
, Go with an adult (preferably female) and best friend. Shop for back-to-school clothes, supplies, makeup, etc. If possible, try the clothes on before buying to save a second trip back to the mall. Look for sales on school supplies in certain chain stores throughout the summer to save money.

, Write your name on all your supplies and your backpack. Label notebooks, folders, and binder sections with the subject you intend to use it for. Organize small items needed for class in your pencil box. Put everything you need in your backpack. If you are a returning student and your school requires an ID for lunch, don't forget to pack it.

, Get a mirror, hairbrush, comb, elastics, pins and clips, and hair accessories. Try out different styles until you find one you like. Go on YouTube to find inspiration from other girls., If any don't fit, exchange them for the proper size.

, Have a trusted female show you how to apply it properly. It shouldn't be noticeable or heavy; keep it light and natural. (Whether you wear make up or not may be between you and your parents. Try compromise with them.), If your school allows it, use nail polish. Learn how to give yourself a manicure and do nail art.

, Agree on this with your parents. You don't want to be late for school, so set an alarm clock., If you have acne, buy skin care products made for your skin type. Many products use benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. Try a product with a sulfur base if those don't help. Learn how to wash your face properly. It is important to stick to a routine., Make sure it is quiet and that you have everything you need there. A desk with a chair and lamp would be great. If you do not have space for a desk, buy a bed desk so you can work on your bed. Keep the area organized to save time on looking for things you need., If you pay attention, you won't need to relearn everything that night and will only need to go over what you didn't understand in class., Some schools have a locker and shower room. Change into your gym uniform and keep your things in the locker. If using a combination lock, turn the dial two times after locking to lower the chance of someone cracking it. If showering, bring a towel, shampoo, and body wash.

, Some schools have lockers for students to hold their belongings. Keep the locker organized and clean. Decorate it to suit your style. If there are no lockers, pack only the things needed for that day to keep the backpack light. If you carry too much in your backpack, your back may hurt when you get home.

, Remember to smile when you're meeting new people. People want to be friends with someone that has a smile on their face!

After school.",How to Get Ready for Eighth Grade," Most schools will give you a list of what you need. On the day before, pack your bag. You only need a few binders and things to write with. You can bring locker things too. If you got your schedule, put that in there. If you got a bus pass, put that in your bag if you plan on taking the bus. Be sure you have something to eat! Pack your lunch, or get money to buy school lunch. A water bottle isn't a bad idea either. If you are a girl, bring a A Just In Case kit. During the first few days, you are being explained procedures and are most likely not going to need all of your supplies.


Express your style. If skinny jeans are your thing, then wear them. You don't have to wear designer clothes. It's optional.;
, You can buy a lock at your local store and practice.

, If your parents can't take you, arrange to take the bus. If you can't do that, walk.

, Some schools have advisory, or homeroom, while others you go straight to your first class.

, This is the most important thing you can do to prepare for eighth grade. If you find yourself sad, be optimistic. Focus on the good things. Have fun; eighth grade is what you want it to be.

, You cannot be prepared to go to middle school if you got three hours of sleep.


Know when to wake up. It might not seem like the biggest worry, but you're wrong, it is. If your bus comes at 8:30, and you wake up at 8:25, you're going to feel disorganized and awkward when you finally sit down in class. The thing is, you should allow yourself enough time in the morning to shower , eat breakfast, dress, do makeup , style your hair, and get ready for the day. Personally, I like to allow myself at least 1 1/2 hours in the morning to prepare.







, You can decorate your room with colorful streamers, confetti, or even an 8th Grade banner! If it helps the anxious and excited feelings cool down before bedtime, do it!

, Choose healthy, wholesome foods like whole grain oats, cereal, or toast with jelly. Eat a fruit like an apple or a banana, or slice a pear. Drink milk, juice, water, or coffee, or perhaps nothing at all. Make sure you don't rush in your eating, because you want your stomach to be settled. A good example of a healthy breakfast is oatmeal with a side of toast, a banana, and a glass of milk or soy milk. If you need a quick meal, if you wake up late, grab a banana or handful of strawberries and something with a few carbohydrates to get your day started.

, When you pick out your outfit for school, do it the night before. Make sure of a few things before you leave the house: Bend over. Make sure your shirt doesn't droop too low, or lift up in the back. Sit down. Make sure that your skirt doesn't lift too high, or your jeans don't rip. You should choose something that will keep you comfortable, but that expresses your individual style.

, When you style your hair, don't just plop it on top of your head. Make sure it looks good, too, by pulling back any leftover wisps of hair and clipping them back. Make sure you wash your hair in the morning or at night before you go to sleep.

, No one wants to be caught with stinky breath or something stuck in there teeth. Not only is this good hygiene, but it also makes for a good first impression.

, Don't overdo your makeup. Always use ChapStick on your lips, so they don't become chapped. That wouldn't be very fun. Make sure the colors of your makeup coordinate with your outfit.

, Check your planner to see if you have everything you need, like homework assignments and permission slips.

, The worst way to start a new school year is in the detention room. Don't try to slide by with shorts that just barely break dress code (if you have one), or a baseball hat if hats aren't allowed. Wear something modest and clean, with no wrinkles in the fabric..

, You'll be meeting your teachers for the first time, and first impressions are everything. Greet your teacher with a smile (even if you're shy) and shake his or her hand if they offer. Say ma'am and sir, and know the difference between ""Can I use the bathroom?"" and ""May I use the bathroom?"" (especially when talking to your English teacher):)

, Handwriting is something that teachers respect. Good penmanship can go a long way in an attempt to stay off of the teacher's ""bad kid"" list.

, Smiling will make you more approachable and make you seem nicer.

, Once you get home after school eat something After that you should start on your homework right away. Make sure you go to sleep early around 9:00 or 9:30

, Purchase separate binders for each subject. Purchase other school supplies that you need, too.

, For school supplies, color-code your books according to subject. Make sure that all of your supplies are in good condition and organized for a perfect first day.

, Buying clothes in basic colors makes for a mix and match closet. Personalize that white tee with an accessory, like a belt or necklace. Get rid of old, small, or droopy clothes. Color coordinate your closet for easy outfit pickings. Make sure all the clothes you wear are school appropriate & your style (not someone else's).

,


Brush your lips with Vaseline. This tip will make your lips soft and inviting for that special him or her. Put some Vaseline (petroleum jelly) on the side of an old toothbrush; if you use the top it will hurt. Do this every night so that your lips will be smooth for school. For all you girls out there, it also removes the dead skin and adds a burst of color to your lips.






Buy a clarifying shampoo and use it once on the day before school so that the product build-up and chlorine will be washed out of your hair. Do not use it more than once every 1 1/2 weeks or it will dry out your hair!






Use a mouthwash to keep your breath fresh. If you start wearing cologne or perfume in middle school, ask your mom or dad if you're overdoing it.







, It's a good start to the school year. You won't have to sift through piles of junk on your first day of school; you already have too much on your mind.

, During middle school, you may experience many blows to your self esteem. Give yourself that ""new you"" look if you're re-doing yourself. On the first day, smile and tell yourself that you look nice!

, Morning and night, make sure that you wake up an hour before school. After that, you'll know how long it will take to get ready so that you can decrease or lengthen that time.

, Do so before all camp, vacation plans, trips, etc., so you will not be rushing to finish your work near the first day of school.

, Set out your outfit and make sure it doesn't have any stains and run it by your friends. Pack your backpack and make sure you have everything ready for the morning. Pack your lunch and tuck some money in your bag. There may be long lunch lines on the first day. Read over your schedule and routes to class before bed, tuck in with a good book. Practice opening a lock before school.

, Don't come home after school without making an effort to reach out to at least one other person.

, You can be popular by not following the crowd. If you're not 'popular', remember that the real popular kids aren't popular; they're just (well most of them) fakes.

, If you get to pick your seat, then choose it wisely. If you are distracted by friends, then it would be better to sit with smart people who seem nice.

, What to have in your locker:


Locker shelves, locker organizer (hang-able or magnetic), mirror (magnetic), mini calendar (magnetic), no more than five dollars, just-in-case kit consisting of: pads (girls), four quarters for payphone, band aids, hairbands, and breath mints.

, If you get sick during school ask a friend to pick up homework and give it to you at home. Do the exact same for this person when they are unwell.

The night before your first day of school, gather all your school materials, pick out an outfit, set your alarm before everyone else in the home wakes up so you can take your time in the bathroom to get ready and not have to race anyone to the bathroom.,
As soon as your alarm goes off, jump out of bed.,
While you're in the shower, wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner.,
After drying your body and hair off, put lotion on your legs, arms, and any body parts that might dry out after you leave the house.,
After your lotion dries and your body is smooth, put on your jeans, t-shirt, belt, sweatshirt.,

",How to Get Ready for Your First Day of School at a Group Home,";
, Gather all your hygiene things; like shampoo, conditioner, razors, shaving cream, toothpaste, toothbrush, body wash, lotion, and deodorant. If you're a girl, get your makeup too.

, Shave your underarms, legs, and private areas. Wash your body with some body wash. You can brush your teeth either in the shower or after you get out.

, While you're waiting for the lotion to dry, put on your undergarments, like underwear, socks, and bra. If you try to put on your pants and t-shirt right after you put on lotion, you will probably have a hard time with your clothes sticking to you.

, After your completely dressed put on some deodorant.

, Start with foundation, face powder, then eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, after eye makeup, put on a little bit of blush, and lipgloss. After putting on makeup and your hair is dry start straightening it. If your hair is not dry, use a blow-dryer.

, You don't want to go to school smelling funky, especially on your first day.

, You don't want to leave anything where its not supposed to be and get stolen, especially living with different kids.

, For girls, bring your makeup bag, hairbrush, and body spray along with you, just in case. For boys, maybe bring some body spray and breath mints.

, If you aren't sure, its always good to be more safe than sorry.

Grab your radio or iPod and turn it up!,
If your room is in a bad state and the thought of cleaning it all makes you overwhelmed and slightly panicked, remember one rule: You can do anything for fifteen minutes.,
Get two laundry baskets, a trash bag, and a box.,
Start in one corner of your room.,
Pull the stuff out from under the bed.,
Move around your room, following a wall until you've cleaned everything along that wall.,
Do not forget your closet!,
After you've gone around all the walls and your closet, do the stuff in the middle of the room.

,
Get the vacuum.,
Use the music and fifteen minute rule described in Part One, if you like.

,
Go through your school binders and your backpack.,
Get one of those expanding portfolio folders, either from the store or something your parents have laying around.

,
Put a bunch of lined paper, and some graph paper if you use it at school, in the very last pocket.,
Leave one or two tabs for each of your classes at school, depending on how many papers that teacher usually hands out.,
Look at all of the papers you decided to keep from the first step, and put them in the right place.

Done.",How to Organize Your Room and School Work (for Teens)," It'll give you a good distraction to what you are actually doing and get you pumped up and ready to go!;
, Just do fifteen minutes of work at a time, then take a break and look at what you've accomplished. Take a few minutes off if you have to (but a few minutes doesn't have to mean the rest of the day). Breaking things into short chunks of time will keep you from getting burnt out.

, If you do not have a big box, use another laundry basket. One basket is for dirty clothes or stuff that needs washing. The other is for stuff in your room that belongs in another place in the house. The box is for things to give away, and the trash bag, obviously, is for the trash.

, A good place to start might be the bed. Just make the bed and arrange the pillows. There, a part of your room is tidy already, and it probably only took a minute or two!

, Don't panic if there is a lot of stuff, just take one thing at a time and sort it. If it belongs in your room, put it near where it should end up. If not, put it in one of the baskets or the trash bag.

, Then, keep going at the next corner.

, Yes, it is tempting to ignore that bulging black hole that's stolen your clothes and shoes and who knows what else, but you must resist the temptation. If you neglect the closet, chaos will creep back in to your space and your effort will have been wasted.

,, It was probably covered up by all of the things on your floor, and now is a good time to vacuum up all of the stains, spots, and whatnot.

,, Clean out all the papers you don't need and either file them for studying for exams or recycle them. (this is easiest at the end of a quarter/semester, but can be done anytime).

,, Label the tab in front of it ""paper"".

, Label the very first tab of each class with the name of that class.

,, That will keep chaos and stress from messing up your life. To do that, we are going to make a Sanity Saver Journal.

, It should be pretty and something you will like using. It should have plastic sleeves in it for pictures. Make sure it can hold at least 20 pictures. That is ten sleeves with 2 in each sleeve.

, You may also need a pair of scissors.

, Make it size 4X6. Find a pretty clip-art background and drag it to fit the rectangle. Now add text. This will be a title for your book. Call it whatever makes sense to you, it is your private book.

, Label it morning routine. The first thing on there, after you wake up, will be make your bed. The rest will just be all of the things you have to do to get ready in the morning. Put things in the order you want them, and don't leave anything out. Add pictures if you want.

, Call it Afternoon Routine. You should list everything you need to do when you get home from school. Don't forget your homework.

, It should say Evening Routine, or Before Bed Routine. List everything you need to do. One of the items should be spend a quick five minutes tidying your room. This way your room will be neat each morning when you wake up. The first thing you see will be a neat and calm space. What a way to start your day!

, Cut them out, and put them in the photo album.

,


On one note card, write ""To Do List"". You will write all the random stuff you have to remember to do on here. Put it in the next available sleeve behind your Evening Routine in the photo album.






On the next 5 note cards, write ""Homework for blank"". Make one for each weekday. Put these in order in the photo album. Take a few minutes each weekend to make new ones for the next week. Now, when a teacher assigns homework you just whip out the card and list it.







, If your school has paper hall passes, like in a student planner, you could cut them out and put them in here. That is what I did so I don't lose them anymore.

, Your sanity saver book is complete. Now all you have to do is look at each day until you remember your routines. Don't forget to put it in your backpack.


Now you are nicely organized. Congratulations!

Know what kind of classes you will need to take.,
Don't get your hopes too high that you'll get all your electives.",How to Get Ready for High School (Girls)1," You will probably need to take some variation of the listed subjects in freshman year. If you can handle a larger work load, you may be put into Honors or Pre-AP classes.


Mathematics - Most Freshmen will take Algebra 1; however, if you took Algebra in 8th grade, you will take either Geometry or Algebra 2. This is a required class.
Science - Freshmen take Earth Science most of the time. Depending on where you live, that will determine what science you take. Science gets more specific as you go along. This is a required class.
English - As you go further into English, you will begin to focus more on literature and not so much grammar and spelling. This is a required class.
Languages - Most high schools offer Latin, German, French, Spanish, and Sign Language.
Gym - Gym is still required in most states for Freshmen and Sophomore year, but after that it can be taken by choice.
Computers/Technology - While this class is not always required, it is one of the most useful classes you can take in High School.
Electives - There are many different electives you can take in High School. You should pick them based on interest and what will help you later in life. Choose your electives very carefully. They're a lot of fun! If you can take tag, go for it. Don't be tempted to take classes just because they're easy-sounding. Take classes that sound interesting and you'll have a better time, even if they're difficult.;
, Every single grade after you gets to pick first! No worries, you'll get your electives at some point.

Decide which method you will use.,
Make your planner a part of your daily routine.,
Fill in things as soon as you find out about them.,
Create your own deadlines.,
Color code your planner.,
Look ahead.,
Review your planner before you start your homework.,
Keep old pages.",How to Organize Your Day Planner for School," You’ll want to pick one that fits in your pocket, purse, or backpack; whichever place you would like to carry it. Choose one in your favorite color or with a fun design so that it is aesthetically pleasing. Ensure it has enough pages and is organized in the way you prefer; some have a page per day, some have two pages per week, etc., You should do this ahead of time for an entire semester or year. Block out a space for each subject or course so when the time comes to write in it, you’ll know exactly where to put each assignment., You’ll likely have other things to do than homework, so make a section to record other engagements such as sporting events, concerts or recitals, dances or other school functions, work or chores, etc. You could schedule in free time as well.

, Write in birthdays, holidays, and other special events ahead of time. That way, when you look at a week or month you’ll know if there are any occasions that could change your schedule or take up extra time. You can also add information such as first and last days of school, holiday breaks, etc.

, You may want to write down assignments on the day they were assigned or on the day they are due. This will depend on your personal style and preference.


If you write things down on the day they were assigned, this will enable you to look at each day to see what you should be working on (e.g., If reading chapter 5 was assigned on Monday, you would write it down under Monday’s space and do the assignment that day).
If you write things down on the day they are due, you will need to look ahead to see what you should be working on (e.g., If reading chapter 5 needs to be completed Wednesday, you would write it down under Wednesday’s space but look ahead on Monday or Tuesday in order to complete the assignment by Wednesday).

, Write new information in your planner every day; any assignments, events, meetings, and get togethers you plan should be recorded daily. You should also check your planner each morning and night to ensure you aren’t forgetting to do anything. You can put a sticky note on your mirror or another place you look daily, or set a daily reminder in your phone, to help you remember to check your planner if you think you might forget., Your teacher may mention that a group project will be due on the last day of class; though that may seem like a long way off, write it down immediately. This goes for homework, tests, other assignments, and events as well. Write down the corresponding textbook pages and any other information the teacher tells you to include.

, If you have a major project or test coming up you can schedule time to work on it in your planner. For example, you could research on Monday, create an outline on Wednesday, and write a rough draft Friday. This will keep you from rushing to complete a big assignment the night before it is due., You may want to do this by subject (blue for algebra, green for chemistry, red for English, etc.) or by type of assignment (blue for tests, green for homework, red for projects, etc.). Choose whichever method you think will be most helpful for you.You can do this with colored pencils, pens, highlighters, or even colorful sticky-note flags.

, On the first day of each week you should scan your planner to see what is due or what events you have. This will give you a good idea of what you will need to do through the week as well as help your manage your time efficiently.

, This will give you an idea of what you need to do that day and help your prioritize assignments. It also ensures that you won’t forget anything and will avoid panicking the next day when you realize you didn’t do everything that was assigned., You never know when you may want to look back and check on something. If you don’t want to keep them in your planner, tear them out and store them in a box or a desk drawer."

Consider what kind of schedule you will have when you buy your supplies.,
Get several good quality notebooks.,
Invest in some mechanical pencils rather than traditional ones.,
Get white latex erasers, not pink ones.,
If you can, aim for plastic covers on your notebooks and folders.,
Get folders.,
Put effort into picking out a new backpack.,
While a computer can be helpful while studying, don't bring it to class.",How to Get Ready for High School (Girls)2," You don't want to carry around a lot for each class if you have eight periods instead of four blocks.

, Once you go high school, the teachers might give you some information and you'll have to write them all. However, if your school doesn't allow you to carry backpacks around during the day, you might want to hang on to a binder to carry them. They can get heavy.


College-made notebooks have more lines on them than wide ruled notebooks. If it's a notebook for taking notes, you'll want college ruled so you get more space. If you're doing a paper that has to be a certain number of pages long (there are a few of these in high school English) and you don't want it to stretch forever, you'll want wide ruled notebooks. If it makes a difference, consider that.

, They might seem more expensive, but they're really worth it. If you get the extra lead sticks to put in them, they'll last you all year.

, Pink erasers dry out and end up being useless, but latex erasers don't. They also leave your paper looking cleaner and don't rip holes in it.

, You can write down assignments on these and erase them later.

, When you go shopping for supplies, bring along a sheet of printer paper and see if it fits in the folder first.

, It is really important, especially if you carry your backpack around in school. You want something stylish that won't wear out and won't wear out your back. Try a messenger bag. Pick one that's made out of a material that won't get dirty too easily, as your bag will spend plenty of time on dirty classroom floors this year.


If your bag is silly, it might be funny now, but when you're looking back on your high school photos years later, you may regret it.

, Avoid bringing any other electronics you don't absolutely need. They get stolen. If you take out electronics during class, it tells everyone else that you have one, which is an incentive to go through your bag. Don't give anybody that incentive. (You'll also earn brownie points with your teachers for keeping this stuff hidden.)

For your hair, keep it cute and neat, but don't go overboard.,
Keep your face clean and looking nice.,
Try out plenty of different styles, but don't get caught up in the trends unless they look good on your body type.,
Don't criticize your own body.,
Wear appropriate footwear.",How to Get Ready for High School (Girls)3,"


Don't come to school the first day with a crazy new hair color. Wait a few weeks later when you're sure it won't leave a bad impression. Same with extensions.
If your hair is oily, wash it with Dawn dish soap before you shampoo and condition.

Wash your hair well.

,


If you have acne, you should use Dawn on your face once a week or so. It really does get rid of the oil.
If you like wearing make-up, don't go overboard. Try to go for just the basics.

, Also, just because it doesn't look good on you doesn't mean you're fat. Some girls are different heights or shapes, and it really affects how clothes look on them.

, If you believe you're beautiful, you will be more beautiful to everyone that looks at you!


Find yourself some cool accessories, but don't pay mall prices for them. Go to Amazon.com and you'll be able to find just about anything you can find in a mall. You don't need to pay fifteen dollars for a necklace when you can buy it online for three bucks.

, Don't wear stilettos if your class is on the fourth floor, but tennis shoes are good for the trip up. Wear something that's stylish, but comfortable.


Invest in a great pair of cozy, waterproof, easily-washable boots for winter, if it applies to you.
Find good socks. Ditch the tube socks and get something that's comfortable.

Don't obsess about being the perfect girl that guys or girls want to date.,
Don't write someone off just because they can program Linux.,
Remember, you can be happy without a boyfriend/girlfriend.,
Be careful not to trod on a person's ego unless it needs treading on.",How to Get Ready for High School (Girls)4," A boy or girl wants the kind of girl they can take home without their mom instantly hating them. They want the kind of girl they can hug without worrying about snapping her in half. He/she wants a real girl, with an actual personality. Not necessarily a Barbie.


People who aim for Barbie-itude aren't worth your time. If someone will talk to you only if you're wearing a Crossing Guard of Negotiable Affections outfit, they're a jerk. Don't let anybody take advantage of you. If you think they'll grow out of it, dump him/her until they do or you'll be in for a lot of misery.

, Geeks are really cool people. They're usually down-to-earth and really smart.

, Guys/girls make really awesome normal friends, though. They're unlikely to stab you in the back or gossip about your secrets, and some guys/girls are more sympathetic than you'd think.


Some people aren't sympathetic, though. They may just freeze up if you start crying, and not know what to do with you. They're not necessarily trying to be mean, and it doesn't mean they don't care. It's just that they might not know how to handle you. They can often find sound, logical solutions to your problems once you've calmed down, though, so they can still help you out a little. Some people like to fix girls' problems.

, Everybody has a bit of an ego, though some more than others.

Be confident.",How to Get Ready Before the First Day of School," Arguably the most important thing you can do in preparing for your first day is making sure you have all of the equipment you need. The types of materials you'll need will vary from class to class. A lot of high school classes will have some sort of online webpage that will post the recommended materials you should bring. Print off a copy for each list of materials and take them to an office supplies store. Certain things, like pens and paper, will be used for virtually all classes, so you can buy a single stack for use throughout your school year. Here are some things you'll almost certainly need for your first day:

A backpack with comfortable shoulder straps
A sturdy binder, filled with ruled paper
Pens (red and black) and HB pencils
Spiral-bound notebooks; one for each class you're enrolled in
A pair of scissors
A scientific calculator and graphed paper, if you're doing mathematics
A small vial of hand sanitizer
A portable USB drive, for saving computer work.;
, Choose the clothes you'll wear for the week and ensure that they're cleaned and prepared for wearing, including ironing if needed. Polish your shoes and check that you've got fresh underwear as well. It can speed things up to decide ahead of each day what you'll wear if you don't have a uniform., Make the parts of your lunch that you can make the night before and place in the fridge. The next morning, take the made things from the fridge, add these and any packaged things to your lunch bag and finish up the last things needed. This will speed up time for you each day. (Don't expect your parents to keep making your lunches, you can definitely do it and in doing so, can decide what you'll be getting!), Depending on what time your school starts, when your bus comes, or when your parents have to leave, wake up about an hour and a half beforehand to prepare yourself. Example: Your bus comes at 7:00 and you have to be there 5 minutes before it comes you should wake up at about 5:30. Yeah, it's early, but it's worth it.

, Once you wake up, go and eat a good breakfast. Have eggs, toast, cereal that's not too sugary, etc. No toaster pastries, but do not skip breakfast. you'll regret it all day.

, After that, go to the bathroom and shower, if you didn't the night before. If you did, quickly freshen up by putting deodorant on. And body spray, or perfume, or whatever. Make yourself smell nice. If one day you forget to shower and don't have time in the morning, at least rinse your hair some and maybe try ""dry shampoo"" spray.

, Don't skip this. Do you really want people to smell morning breath? Everyone has it. Brush for at least 3 minutes for that extra whiteness. It will make your smile much more flattering and approachable. If you want to whiten up your smile a bit try mixing lime or lemon juice with baking soda and scrub your teeth with it, then brush your teeth, but only once a week, or else it will weaken your teeth.

, Some great hair ideas are the classic ponytail, curled pigtails, waves, French braids, or just simply wear your hair down. Curl, straighten, part...the possibilities are endless. Do not overdo it. But don't under do it either. Make it look like your hair required effort. And please, if you do shower in the morning, dry your hair before you leave. Wet head = bad impression.

, Ahh, clothes. Make sure everything thing you want to wear is clean and set out the night before.


Pick out the bottoms. Jeans are cool, slacks say serious, shorts say laid back, a skirt says girly, and a dress says Wow, someone tried hard this morning.






Shirt. Not a long sleeve, it is likely too hot, because no matter where you are, students typically start school in August or September. So short sleeved, or tank top if the school allows it. Make it a good one,






Shoes. They should complement the colors in your outfit and share the same ""style"".






Accessories. Don't overdo it, just a few pieces of jewelry. make them coordinate with the outfit.







, If you are allowed to and like wearing makeup go easy on it. Put on some mascara and lipgloss for a very light look if you want to you can put on a little it of eyeliner (don't look like a raccoon) and some foundation or powder. A tip if eyeliner makes your eyes look small, don't use the eyeliner on the inner corner of the eye. Starting on the outside corner, draw a line only 2/3 of the way towards the other side. When you completely surround your eye with eyeliner on both top and bottom, you close it up and it looks smaller.

,, Act confident. Be nice and say hi to everyone and do your best. So many opportunities are lost when you are shy.

Take everything out of your desk.,
Sort everything into piles.,
Recycle, pack up, or file old papers.,
Wipe down your desk.,
Use masking tape to make sections in the storage part of the desk.,
Put large items in first.,
Use organizer boxes for other supplies.,
Have one container for assorted junk that will accumulate.,
Inspect your desk on a regular basis to maintain order.",How to Organize Your School Desk," Lay things out on top of the desk so that you can see most of it. You may have to pile things up a little bit, but that’s okay for now. Once it’s all laid out, you can see what you had in your desk and begin to sort through it.If you don’t have quite enough room on top of your desk, you can set some of the things on your chair, on the floor, or on a nearby table.
If you can’t take everything out at once, you can remove things from the desk a few things at a time as you sort through it all, discard some things, and re-organize what’s left.;
, These piles could be textbooks, notebooks and folders, supplies like pens, ruler, and compass, graded papers, assignments you are still working on, and assorted items like paper clips, toys, or stickers.Sorting it out like this will help you see what sections you can organize your desk into. It will also help you see what doesn’t belong.
As you sort, throw away anything that is obviously garbage such as candy wrappers, paper scraps, or broken writing utensils. Having a trash can, or at least a plastic bag, nearby will help you get rid of things more quickly.
Check over supplies like pens, pencils, markers, crayons, paper clips, rubber bands, and erasers, and throw away anything that is broken, dried out, or no longer useful.

, Your desk is most likely filled with graded papers and handouts. Take a look through all of it to see what you have. Recycle anything you definitely don’t need.


Put papers into your backpack that your parents will want to see or that you don’t need at school. Put papers that need to be kept into a folder or pile.
It is also good at this point to look through papers you might have in folders, notebooks, and textbooks and do the same sorting on those.

, While everything is out of your desk, take a wet paper towel with soap, or cleaning wipes, or disinfectant spray and give the whole desk a once over. Wipe around the inside of the desk, as well as the surface. You can even wipe under it and around the legs if you want to be thorough.


You may need to ask your teacher for cleaning supplies and for permission to use them on your own. You’ll also have to set the stuff on your desk off to the side while you clean it.
If you aren’t allowed to use cleaners, you can still wipe everything down with a wet paper towel. This will be better than nothing.
You may have to let the desk dry before putting anything back in it.

, One way to keep things in place is to create 2-3 sections inside the desk by dividing it with tape. You’ll want a large section for textbooks, maybe one for notebooks and folders, and 1-2 for the rest of the items you’ll need. Ask your teacher before putting tape on your desk.If the top of the desk lifts, this should be easy to do, but for slide-in desks it may take a little more maneuvering. For slide-in desks, you’ll want to put things at the back that you don’t need very often.
The amount of space you have in your desk will determine how many sections you can create. You may just divide it in half to keep textbooks separate from everything else, or you may want 5 or more specific sections if you make smaller sections.
If you can’t use tape, or you don’t want to, just think of where you’d put sections inside the desk so you can organize in that way as you fill the desk.

, Your books, folders, and notebooks will take up the most space, so put these in first in the section you’ve designated for them. Also put items toward the back that you will need less frequently.If you usually take notebooks or folders out of your desk multiple times every day, you may want to leave these out for now and set them on top of the other things in one section of your desk.
For now, you should stack your books with the largest (widest and thickest) one on the bottom and smaller ones toward the top of the stack.
Now is a good time to label your folders if you haven’t yet. You can label them by subject or with something like “Work to do,” “Completed work,” and “Extra papers.”

, One of the best ways to organize all of the small items in your desk is with small boxes. You could use old jewelry boxes, tissue boxes (cut smaller), or even small food boxes. Place a couple of these in your desk so you can separate smaller items.


Other options would include getting a pencil case for all your writing utensils or small plastic containers for paper clips, rubber bands, staples, and erasers. You could keep the lids on to avoid spills or leave the lids off for easier access.
If you have room in your desk, you could purchase a desk organizer which has sections for all of these things.
Place containers of things you need less often toward the back and containers for things you frequently use toward the front.

, Besides the containers for supplies you need, it’s also helpful to have one just for random things you gather. This might be stickers from a teacher, a rubber ball from a friend, candy, or rocks you gather at recess.Keeping this stuff separate is a great way to maintain the ordered desk you have just created.
You should go through this container every so often to empty it of things you don’t want to keep. Other things will only stay in your junk jar for a while and then will be used.

, Since you will take things out of your desk and put them back daily, it’s bound to get disorganized again before long. If you work hard to always put stuff in it’s proper spot and you check it weekly, your desk can stay organized for a long time."

Expect your teachers to be nice, intelligent people.,
Pay attention to instructions.,
Just do the best you can with mean teachers.,
Try really hard not to turn in anything late.",How to Get Ready for High School (Girls)5," Usually, at least half of them are. Teachers are people, too!

, Then, the teacher is usually happy to help you. Most of what they say actually is interesting.

, Arguing with them is counterproductive and drains your energy on people who aren't worth it.

, If you do, sooner rather than later. Just make sure you turn in everything! An assignment with a few points off for being late is better than a zero.

The bag is an important part of back to school.,
Your binder(s) should go in the biggest section, the one closest to your back.,
The second biggest pocket is where your books should go.,
The final and smallest section should be on the front of your bag.,
For many bags, this is just the bare minimum.,
Put the heaviest things closest to your back and the lightest things furthest; the weight will balance itself out and you won't be falling backwards half the time.

","How to Organize Your Bag, Binder, and Locker1"," Getting one that's big enough can be challenging.;
, This is usually the best option, because this part is generally biggest and will give you room for all your binders, even once they've been filled with papers.

, You may also want to place your calculator in this section. Once you begin the year, your novels and smaller textbooks will also fit very nicely.

, Depending on what you're interested in, you may want to put a small novel, makeup, cell phone, iPod, etc. It's mainly up to your school.

, Most bags have side pockets, pockets with pockets, ""Netted"" pockets. There are many varieties, and this guide is just something to go by.

Empty your backpack out.,
Place everything you’ve removed in three piles.,
Sort your school supplies.,
Sort your notebooks, folders, papers, and books.,
Pack only the notebooks, folders, and books you need.,
Add an extra folder for parent-teacher communications.,
Sort the items you use semi-regularly.",How to Organize Your Backpack1," If you’re starting with a brand-new and empty backpack, you’re way ahead of the game. If your backpack is stuffed full of papers, books, and other stuff from your previous semester, empty it completely.Don’t forget to empty all the little zippered compartments as well as the main compartment.
Tip your backpack upside down over a bin when finished emptying it to get those last few scraps, crumbs, and bits of lint out.;
, Make three separate piles. In one pile, place all your school supplies (mini staplers, pencils, erasers, and so on). In a second pile, place all your papers, folders, textbooks, and notebooks. In the third pile, place things you’ll need on a regular or semi-regular basis (mittens, your lunch pail, and so on).Discard or find a home for anything that doesn’t fit in any of these three categories.
For instance, if your backpack contained a phone charger for a phone that you don’t use, discard it or store it at home along with the phone.

, Choose one compartment for pens, pencils, and erasers. Use this compartment for these materials and nothing else.If possible, assign these materials to a compartment designed for pens and pencils. If present, this compartment will have loops or slots into which you can slide pens and pencils so that they don’t move around so much inside your backpack.
If you don’t have a compartment that secures your pens and pencils nicely, consider investing in a pencil case and putting it in the backpack compartment that you use for school supplies., These will go in the largest central compartment of the backpack. If possible, organize them according to color. For instance, if you have a book that has a blue (or mostly blue) cover, match it with a blue folder and a blue notebook. Stack these materials in a regular order. For instance, place books beneath their corresponding folders, and place the matching notebook on top of the folder. Repeat this pattern for every class.Place all your papers in an appropriate folder. If you find any that you don’t need or want, recycle them.

, To increase your backpack’s level of overall organization, check it each night or each morning to ensure it includes only what you need for the coming school day. Leave the rest of your school materials in your locker or at home. This will keep your pack organized and prevent you from carrying too much., If you get a permission slip or report card that your parents need to sign, you’ll need a place to put it. Add another folder to the pile of folders, books, and notebooks for these communications.Place this folder behind or in front of the other books and folders.

, These will vary depending on your needs. In cold weather, for instance, you’ll probably pack gloves, lip balm, and hand lotion. Other items you might want include sunglasses, an umbrella, and a water bottle. Assign these items to a pocket or compartment of your choice. The beverage pocket typically accommodates these smaller items quite nicely."

Take everything out of it - binders, loose papers, etc.,
Separate the things you need and you don't need.,
Put all the things you need starting from heavy to light.,
If you have a book bag with two large pockets, put your morning classes in one pocket and the afternoon classes in the other.

,Something else you can do if you have two different compartments is to put your books and stuff in the first one, and your gym clothes or clothes for after school in the other one then you can be organized

","How to Organize Your Bookbag, Locker, Binder and Desk1",";
, If there are old notes, keep them at home for future reference. Recycle old flyers, handouts, and scrap paper.

, Start with textbooks in the back, folders, and then a pencil bag in the front. Don't worry about your binder yet. This way you won't lose your balance.

"
A good system to go by is get one 2 inch binder for all your subjects.,
If the option is available, find out your courses beforehand.,
Put a reasonable amount of paper in each one.,
If you really feel like being organized, separate your binder into different sections, such as tests, assignments, and notes.,
Decorate your binder as you wish.","How to Organize Your Bag, Binder, and Locker2"," You can separate the sections of paper and notes by tab dividers. This is neater and much more convenient way. The best kind of tab dividers are the plastic ones with folders because you can count on them more.

, Most binders have a paper slip on the spine which you can slide out, write your subject on, and slide back in. Doing this ahead of time will save you time later. If not, then just use a 2 inch binder and just put on the side, ALL CLASSES, it should work.

, Some courses require more note taking than others, but it's a good idea to be prepared nonetheless.

, Some teachers will tell you the specific sections to put in your binders. It is not recommended to name your tabs ahead of time, because it can make the teachers unhappy and you very frustrated. This may be a waste of time if you are in a lower grade. Doing this is only recommended if you are in middle or high school. Though some middle schools are specific so it's best to wait if you are starting in middle school. (Or if you switch classes in Elementary School, which most don't.)

, Make it yours with stickers, song lyrics, or your favourite celebrity. Anything you want really.

Lockers are a bit complicated.,
As inspiration to keep it neat, decorate it from the very first day.,
In reference to the shelf, it's a good idea to buy one, or even two.","How to Organize Your Bag, Binder, and Locker3"," You only visit them for a total of a few minutes each day, it's hard to keep it neat and clean.

, Though you may not have tons of time, take a few minutes during the first week to put up some pictures, neat magnets, or a funky shelf.

, They come fairly cheap (three to five at most department stores), and most can be stacked on top of one another. This frees up a bit of space. Most lockers have a shelf in them already, or if you have a half locker, these are a must have to keep your locker organized.


Luckily, some school have Prep Days, Orientation, or Open House where they let you go to your locker to put up shelves and mirrors so that on the first day of school, you just put away your backpack and binders and go try to find your first class. If they don't come to school early or stay after school. (If your school allows it, you don't want to get in trouble.)

Take everything out of your backpack.,
Organize your backpack by weight.,
Organize your internal frame backpack.,
Organize your external frame backpack.,
Place useful items in accessible locations.,
Maximize your backpack’s space.,
Use your backpack’s compartments as intended.",How to Organize Your Backpack2," Only when your backpack is empty will you have an adequate sense of what your backpack can accommodate. Plus, if you’ve organized your pack in the same way for a long while, emptying it out completely can help you imagine new ways to organize it more efficiently., Pack items that are of a similar size and weight. Identify the items that are heaviest, and determine if the extra weight is really worth it.For instance, if you have a cooking pan you really like but it pushes you over the weight limit you’ve set for yourself, you might want to ditch it. If you decide it’s too heavy, try to find a similar item that weighs less.
There is no target weight toward which you should be aiming in your organizational efforts. Everyone can accommodate a different mass based on their hiking experience and their body type. Set your weight limit at whatever is right for you.

, When organizing an internal frame backpack, the area at the bottom should be reserved for light material, while the medium-weight stuff should be packed on top of it. The heaviest things should be packed in the middle of the forward-most area of the backpack (in other words, against the area that actually touches your back)., If you have an external frame backpack, place the lightest material in the bottom, the place medium-weight material on top of that. Slide the heaviest items in the top of the backpack, tucking them as tightly as possible against the forward-most area of the pack.The goal in both modes of organization is to center the weight on your hips so that you can more easily maintain balance.

, Items that you might use or need at any time – insect repellents, snacks, rain ponchos, and so on – should be placed in outer pockets. If you organize your backpack in such a way that these items are buried under a mound of other things you don’t need to access regularly, you’ll have to dig through your whole pack to get to them., If you have a pot in your backpack, place a shirt inside it. If you want to pack duct tape, slide it over your hiking poles. If you’re using a bear canister, cram it full of snacks and other scented items., Many hiking and camping backpacks have special compartments that have been designed for particular purposes. For instance, many backpacks have space for a water bladder (typically located directly behind and at the top of the pack). Other packs have slots specifically designed for sleeping bags. Consult your backpack owner’s guide to identify how the manufacturer intended the backpack to be used."

",How to Organize School Work," Write down all the Schoolwork you have to do and then write the due date. That will be a little reminder. You can also write down when you want to study or the day of a test! Anything that you would like to remember about the school day. Some schools provide planners to students so in that case you will not need to buy one.;
, Try dividing the long-term goals into short-term ones as it make your work easier ! Use diaries and planners to keep schedules . This is efficient not only for your school homework but also the extra-studies which you would like to do .
, Color coordinate the folders by each subject (e.g.: Language Arts (red), Math (blue), and so on). Keep all the Schoolwork from each subject inside it's own folder so everything isn't so messy. You would also want to color coordinate notebooks, too. Another good thing is to buy a homework folder so you won't be taking all your folders home. It saves up space in your backpack. Keep all these things in your binder so you won't lose any of them in the hallway or at home.

, That will help you know when due dates and tests are. Plus, you'll be learning more by paying more attention. Remember, listen more than taking notes.

, You can have a little snack first, but that's it. Go to your planner and check all the homework you have due the next day. Do that first. Then, you can start a little work that you have to hand in later on after.

, If you need one binder per class, make each class a different color. If you only need two, make A-day one color and B-day another. No matter what color your notebooks are, get highlighters, book covers, stickers, ANYTHING, in the same color. That way you can look at a glance and see what you need what day.

, Put two pencils, two black pens, two red pens, highlighters, etc. in this pouch for quick and easy access.

, If you're using two binders, get two types of dividers (I use pocket dividers and small tab ones). Use one type to separate the classes, and use the other to put your classes in different sections (note, homework, etc.)

, Make sure heavy items (textbooks and binders) are closer to your back so it'll be easier to carry. It will probably be easier to have two different backpacks, one for A day & one for B day. That way you won't have to keep packing & unpacking your backpack and can just grab the backpack & go!

Purchase a large enough backpack.,

Purchase pens and pencils that can be refilled.,
Gently place your folders into your backpack.,
Keep paper in your binder or in a folder.,
Keep extra supplies at home.,
Put your supplies away when you’re done with them.,

Be gentle with your supplies.,
Avoid lending your supplies.,
Put your name on things.",How to Make Your School Supplies Last," Backpacks are one of the most expensive school supplies you’ll need. As a result, purchase a backpack that has plenty of room and that you can grow into. If you buy a small backpack, you’ll likely have to upgrade to a larger one in the near future.


Pick a backpack that appeals to you, but is neutral enough so it won't go out of style.;
, While it might be tempting to buy cheaper school supplies to save money, you should focus on quality when purchasing items. Some quality brands and their products include:JanSport, North Face, and Patagonia backpacks. These backpacks could potentially last you the entire time you are in school.
Flair, Bic, and Sharpie pens.
Palomino, Dixon Ticonderoga, and General's Semi-Hex pencils.

, One of the best ways to prolong some school supplies is to purchase plastic ones. This is especially true with folders and dividers, since they’ll typically last a lot longer than paper or cardboard ones.Buy plastic dividers that you can relabel.
Use folders that are completely made of plastic. This way, paper or cardboard parts won’t break, forcing you to purchase new ones.

, One of the easiest ways to make your school supplies last is to use pens and pencils that are refillable. This way, instead of having to purchase new pens and pencils when they run out of ink or wear down, you can simply refill them with ink or graphite., Place your folders gently into your backpack instead of stuffing them in. This way, you won't damage them and anything else that is in your backpack. In the end, your folders, backpack, and other supplies will suffer less wear and tear.

, When it comes time to pack your backpack, don’t simply throw a pack of notebook paper into your backpack. Chances are that it will wind up bent and crinkled – and you might waste some paper. Instead, put your paper directly into a folder or binder., Instead of carrying all your supplies with you to school, take only what you need and keep all extras organized at home. This way, you’ll have what you need daily, but you won’t have too much to keep track of. In addition, if you lose your backpack, you won’t lose all of your supplies., Once you’re done using something, put it back where you got it. For instance, if you just used your highlighter, make sure to return it to your pencil bag or your backpack. If you don’t, it could get lost. This way, everything will be where it is supposed to be, and you’ll be less likely to lose something.Whenever you’re done using a pen or pencil, put it back into your pencil box or bag.
Put loose sheets of notebook paper back into your notebook instead of throwing them away or letting them get crumpled in your backpack.

, One of the biggest ways to ruin pens or markers is to leave tops off them. To avoid this, make sure to put tops back on pens and markers whenever you’re done with them. In addition, if you have a pushdown pen, make sure to push it back down when you’re done., Whenever you handle your supplies, be gentle with them. Ultimately, wear and tear is one of the most common ways that a lot of school supplies simply stop working. Try to be careful handling your supplies, and don’t abuse them.


Don’t throw your notebooks and binders around. They’ll wear out faster and you could break them.
Be careful where you put your backpack. If you want it to hold up for a long time, you need to make sure you don’t throw it onto the sidewalk or let it get walked on or rained on.

, Although your friends and schoolmates might ask to borrow supplies, sharing your supplies will lessen the amount of time they will last. Instead, tell your friends that you don’t have enough to share.


Be polite. For instance, say “Sorry, I don’t really have much to spare.”
Buy certain supplies to share. For example, buy a cheap pack of notebook paper to share with your friends. In addition, buy some inexpensive pens or pencils to lend to friends if they need one. This way, your quality supplies won’t get lost and will last longer.

, Use a label maker, masking tape, or other ways to put your name on your school supplies. If you don’t want to put your name on things, you could simply color code or make tags for important school supplies. This will help you recognize your school supplies if you lose them. Consider putting your name or a tag on the following:Pencil bags
Your backpack
Folders

Find or purchase a notebook.,
Write your name inside the front cover.,
Write or staple a copy of your class schedule on the first page.,
Think about how you want to decorate the outside.,
Collect your materials.,
Go for it!,
Open to the second page.,
Divide the right page into three sections.,
Label each section with the day of the week and the date.,
Title the left page ""After School"" or “Upcoming Events.” This side is where you keep track of extracurricular activities, like band practice, sporting events, and dance class.,
Open your notebook to the second page.,
Draw a table with two rows and six columns.,
Label each column with a day of the week.,
Write the date range above the calendar.,
Lay your notebook flat so that you can see both pages.,
Title the left page “Upcoming Events.” If you have enough space on your calendar, you could also just write your extracurricular activities there.,
Add useful sections in the back of the notebook.,
Use sticky tabs or flags to label the sections.,
Write in your assignments.",How to Make Your Own School Planner," Think carefully about the size that you want. If you like to include a lot of details, you’ll probably need a larger notebook. But something smaller will be easier to carry, and it will take up less room in your backpack.


You’ll also have a choice of bindings. Spiral-bound notebooks lie flat, but composition books and similar notebooks with a sewn binding won’t damage your other books and papers, as spiral bindings sometimes do.If you like to keep all of your papers together, consider purchasing a notebook that has a folder attached or a pocket inside the front cover.
If you choose to draw a biweekly calendar rather than listing your assignments, you may find that blank, grid-lined, or grid-dotted paper is a good choice.;
, Also include any information that would help someone return your planner if you lose it. This includes your grade level, phone number, and/or student ID number.

, This way, you’ll have it available for easy reference.

, Do you like stickers, or are you more of a doodler? Do you hoard pictures and fun text from magazines and love to create collages from interesting materials?Do you like making daisies with White-Out and highlighters?


If you like comics, consider drawing a comic strip or your favorite superhero on the cover.Make sure that whatever you use will be durable. For example, if you glue sequins to the cover or use glitter, you risk losing your decorations in the deep, dark bottom of your backpack.

, Once you have a plan, make a list of everything you need. Paints, markers, glue, colored pencils: gather it all together and set yourself up wherever you like to work when you’re creating things.

, Decorating the outside is one of the best ways to make your planner just for you. And the more you feel like your planner expresses your personality and creativity, the more you’ll want to use it. Plus, you’ll get to show off your beautiful work!

, Lay the notebook flat so that you can see both the reverse side of the first page on the left and the front side of the second page on the right.

, The sections can be vertical columns or horizontal rows, depending on what you’re more comfortable with.


Adjust the number of sections per page according to the size of your pages and how many assignments you have.
Lay it out in a way that makes sense to you. The point is to set up so that you'll find it easy to use and will consult it daily. A planner that you don't like using obviously won't help you organize your homework and get assignments done.

, For example, Monday, March 3; Tuesday, March 4; and Wednesday, March 5. This is where you will record your homework assignments from that day.


If you structure the sections horizontally, you can use the margin or make a column on the right side to keep track of when your assignments are due.

, You can divide it up into days like you did on the right side, or you can just list everything in the order that it will occur.


You can add other sections to this page if there is anything else you need to keep track of. The more information you write down, the more you’ll use your planner as a reference. And if you’re using your planner regularly, you’ll be less likely to forget an important assignment.

, Turn it so that it is horizontal in front of you.

, Use a ruler if you like neat, precise lines. Make each square large enough to record your assignments.


If you are using a smaller notebook, you may only be able to comfortably fit one row. That’s perfectly fine. It’s better to have only one week on the page than to make the boxes so small that you can’t fit all the information you need.

, Start with “Monday” above the first column, “Tuesday” above the second, and so on through Friday. The sixth and final column is for the weekend, so you can write either “Weekend” or “Saturday/Sunday.”

, For example, Monday, February 3rd to Sunday, February 16th.

, Rotate it so that it is vertical again.

, However, you may find that your assignments fill the available space.

, You can make a page of goals for the next few weeks or the semester, a page for the school calendar, and a page with contact information and birthdays.

, It will be easier to use your planner if you can flip straight to the section you need.

, Make sure to write your assignments down every day. If you don’t have an assignment, make a note of it so that you’ll know later that you didn’t just forget to write it down.

More could be found in the syllabus you are handed out, but this would be a good amount of thing to make sure you bring everyday. Check your backpack to see if any material needs refilling, such as paper.;
, This will help you remember all the assignments you have to turn in and anything you have to get done. Weather it is big or small, all assignments could be remembered this way. It will also help you remember important due dates.

, This is good because some teachers do not tell you the assignments in class or they don’t tell you all of assignments. Teachers will like it if you visit their websites frequently.

, Do not think you could get the assignment done in an advisory period/free period or at lunch. Things may come up that will prevent you from finishing your work. Also, you may not have enough time because the work takes longer than expected to finish.

, Some times there are special schedules for different events. There could be an assembly schedule, a minimum day, or a different schedule for testing.

, Reread the directions that you have to follow. Also, read ahead to help you get ahead of your classmates. Start studying for tests even if they do not come up for a couple more days. There may be a lot of material to cover.

, To do so, you will need to understand all the topics that was covered in your assignments. To do this, fully concentrate and understand your assignments.

, Being fully alert allows you to perform very well in class. This is especially true when taking a difficult test or doing a presentation.

, The teacher may be telling you important information that will be needed in the future. Some of the material may come up on tests even if it is not on textbooks.

, Do not wait until the last minute and find out that it is going to take longer than expected. If you start early, you know how long it will take and you could plan accordingly.

, Have at least two pads and two tampons in regular and heavy flow in your bag. This is very important. Packing an extra pair of underwear might help. Your period might catch you by surprise, and it sucks when that happens. Even if it doesn't, your friend might need feminine supplies and it feels great to be able to help out a friend in a time of need, especially if you are a girl.

, But, be careful, some schools have rules against wearing perfume because some people may be allergic to it. Have cologne or aftershave if you prefer.

, What if you get bad breath or you have something stuck in your teeth? You can get mini tooth brushes from the store and pack those with some floss and perhaps some toothpicks.

, Be careful, in some schools you aren't allowed to bring most medications because you could give it to other students. But cough drops are usually okay, and they are a good idea just in case you get a bad cough. Make sure you check your school's policy on bring medications (such as cough drops).

, Just in case you end up messing up your makeup or you forget to put some on. If you don't wear makeup, skip this step. Mascara, foundation, and lip gloss are some good things to bring.

, Do not put more than $20 / £18 / ¥17 / €22 in your bag. You don't want it to get stolen. Use this money if you or a friend need to buy something.

, If you end up getting your period by surprise, or your flow is heavier than you expected and you leak, if you keep an extra pair of pants in your locker you won't have to walk around with a blood stain on your pants. Also, if you end up spilling something on your pants or shirt, you will have an extra to change into.

, Zip your bag or close it, and put in your locker when you get the chance. You should now have your very own 'Just in Case' kit. Use it as needed.

Figure out where all your decorations could go.,
Make a budget for your decorations.",How to Decorate Your Locker for Holidays1," Locker walls are great for decorations as a lot of pictures can be doodled or drawn quickly or with a click of a button, be printed off the internet. If you can find a small figurine then it can be placed on top of some books or in a free corner of your locker., Make sure the budget isn't too big but make sure its not too small either. Reuse old decorations from your home or your neighbors homes."

This isn't just something you can do between classes. Try asking your parents to drop you off at school early, or see if you can stay at school late one day to focus on getting your locker in shape.
You may need as little as 5 minutes to clean and organize your locker, but depending on how bad it is you may want to plan for as much as 20 minutes. Be honest with yourself; overestimating is better than underestimating when it comes to time.
Double check that your locker cleaning session won't be interrupted by another activity, and check with your parents and/or your school to make sure the time you picked is acceptable.;
,


Decide what it is that is making your locker messy and inefficient in the first place. Is it a big pile of old gym clothes? Do you have too many bulky decorations? Are there old books and papers or a lack of sufficient shelf space? It may sound stupid, but you can't solve the problem if you don't know what the problem really is.
Determine a simple solution. If you had too many decorations for example, your solution could be to get rid of some of them. This will help you get the results you want out of your locker, since you will have a more structured goal to accomplish.

,


Empty your locker first to make organizing easier later.
If you find any obvious trash such as empty water bottles, old bag lunches, or candy wrappers, throw them away or recycle them.
Put any items such as gym clothes, art projects, or personal items you know you want to take home in your backpack or another bag.

,


Find any old packets, fliers, tests, or worksheets and either recycle them or put them in a bag to bring home. This will clear some of the clutter from your locker.
Any papers you still need, you should put them in their proper binders or folders. If you don't have any folders or binders, you should consider getting them in order to carry things easier and find them better.
Papers you are unsure about, put them in a special pile or folder. You should ask your teachers about them before discarding to be sure they're not important.

,


If you've never used it or it takes up needed shelf space, it is unnecessary. Throw it away or put it in a bag to take home. Even if you like it, you need to remember that a clean and efficient locker is your first priority, not a fancy decorated one.
Shelves, baskets, and bags that go in your locker can be useful for storage, but realize that they can also be unnecessary space-wasters. See if your bags, shelves, and baskets are really worth keeping; if they always jam your locker or are never used, they can go.

,


Anything in your locker that isn't yours should be brought back to the owner, assuming you know who's stuff it is. If you don't, drop it off at the lost and found.
Put your loose writing utensils in a pencil pouch, paper clips and rubber bands in the trash, and anything else where it belongs. Having loose odds and ends in your locker takes up more space than you might think.

,


You could use a wet paper towel or cleaning supplies of your choice. The goal here is to pick up any food crumbs, dirt, and dust that may have accumulated in your locker over time.

,


A good way to go about this is to think practically. You probably don't want to put folders and notebooks you need for class every day under a big pile of binders and textbooks; you'll have to tear apart your locker to get them out, and they probably won't get put back where they belong after use.
You could put heavier items such as textbooks on the bottom shelf of your locker, and lighter or smaller items such as pencils on the top. Items you need every day for class should be easily accessible and towards the middle/top of your locker.
You could also divide your locker in half. Top: backpack, gym clothes, pencil pouch, notebooks sometimes. Bottom: Text books, binders, notebooks.
Save a little bit of room in your locker so that if you need to put a new folder or class project there you will have enough space. It also makes things easier to pull out and put back in if they aren't packed in super tight.

,


Make a mental note of how it looks. That is how it should look all of the time!
You will need to put in a few extra minutes each week to keep it looking nice and functioning efficiently.

,


At the beginning of the day, neatly put all of your homework materials back where they belong. This will ensure you know where everything is, and that your locker stays efficient.
At the end of the day when packing your homework materials, double check that everything is in its place.
It may sound like a lot of extra work, but once you get into the habit of doing it, you will often find your locker looking and functioning great without doing anything.

,


If you feel your locker layout isn't working the way you'd like, fix it! You can go to school early or stay after school to change things around a bit. You could even do it between classes if it's a simple enough fix.
Keeping your locker efficient and clean is your main goal. If you find yourself rearranging a lot, rethink what you want your locker to be like and make it happen. Remember that it will never be perfect!

, Where are you going to go school supply shopping? You could go to Staples, Office Max, Target, The 99 Cents Store, Walmart, and pharmacies. They have good stuff at a pretty good price, and they have great deals at the end of Summer.

, Make sure you do this at least 1 day before you go shopping. Make sure your friends' parents knows this too. Call and remind them if necessary.

, Most schools include a school supply list. If your school provides it make sure it's close to you right now. If you lost yours or your school doesn't provide one, look at the list at the end of this article.

Often you can print school lists out online, or some stores associated with your school might provide them for free.
If you have lots extra to get, copy it down with the school's recommendations on a piece of notebook paper.
Make sure that your list is on one page.;
, Clean each item to get a better look at its condition.


If your binder is breaking at the spine, has any torn pockets, or its rings have stopped working properly, replace it.

Try to create a budget to minimize spending, stick to this budget and take advantage of discounts and offers.


Get recommended brands if they're on sale or affordable. If they're too expensive, any brand will do.

, When you go to the store, only buy what you need. Try not to pick up little extras that aren't on the list (unless you genuinely forgot about them). Be kind to your or your parents' wallet.

Tie alike supplies together with elastic bands.,
Place most often used items on the top of large compartments for easy access.

,
Build your own organisation system.",How to Organise Your Pencil Case," It should be able to hold 1 or 2 kg. You can buy pouches and cases that fit in binders or carried separately. You can also make your own out of fun things like duct tape, but everything must have a clip to secure the item in the loop. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of different styles:


Binder Pouch Style: It fits into binder, usually has 2 or more compartments, and is readily available during class. However, you may forget to take it out at locker breaks (if you use separate binders for classes), and it can make binder hard to close or even break.
Separate Pouch or Case: It doesn't need to be taken out of binders, and usually has one big, visible open compartment for quick grabbing. It's easier to carry outside of a binder and allows for more capacity. However, it can easily be left behind if it falls.
Duct Tape Craft Case: This is a fun, water resistant and inexpensive design that provides a modern look and is fun to make. However, it can only hold items with a pocket clip.
Choosing the correct case is crucial. If you get a case you don't like and neglect it, you'll be back at square one, nagging for basic supplies. ;
, It is important that you check all of your supplies periodically. Do I have all of the supplies I started with? Did I find any? Did I lose any? Did someone borrow or take any? Keeping a supply list right in you case is a good idea. You also need the correct supplies. These items will get you started more or less. Experiment with what you need and what you can do without.


Pencils (wood or mechanical; get a hand sharpener if you prefer wood or leads and erasers for mechanical)
Pens (find out what kind you like, plain ballpoint, gel, roller-ball, etc.)
Highlighters (3 or 4 different vibrant colors)
Sticky Notes or Index Cards (keep a good supply and don't waste! Index Cards are probably better to keep in the case, Stickies can be put in book pages or in lockers.)
Correction Tape (don't get liquid because it's messy, takes time to dry, and can spill.)
A glue-stick.

Make yourself a note of any items you need to bring from home.",How to Organize Your Locker," If you want to make minor changes, do so between classes, but keep in mind you might be late. If you need to tidy all of your possessions, take time when the area isn't flooded with people and you have time to concentrate on the task at hand. After school would be a great time to tidy up your locker. Also, make sure your locker partner will be there as well so you don't throw away anything they might need.


If you are cleaning a locker at work you should try to do this when it isn't interfering with your work duties. Stay late or arrive early. Consider stopping in on your day off.;
, Organize these things into three piles:


Everything you are keeping in your locker






A trash pile






A pile for things that you want to take home or have to turn in







, Use another cloth to dry it. If working with a wet rag is inconvenient you can bring a few of the pre-moistened, disposable cleaning cloths. Store them in a Ziploc bag if you don't want to bring the container. The Ziploc bag will prevent them from drying out. (This step is not necessary, but very helpful.)

, Then, sort the items you want to keep in your locker into groups again. Books, clothes, hygiene products, jewelry, and any other groups that you think are necessary.


If you don't need it or won't be using it for some time you should take it home for safekeeping.
Use extreme caution before keeping anything valuable in your locker. Most schools, sports clubs and work places can still gain access to your locker for security reasons. Not everyone is honest. Lockers are also commonly broken into, especially if you are known to keep valuables stored there.

, If you need a locker shelf, arrange to get one; it makes more space for your things. Having a shelf almost doubles your space. Metal ones work best, and are least likely to break, however, consider the following: Adjustable shelves are great, but unless a shelf has support, it may sink if it has too much weight on it. Shelves with bases are great, but they limit the height of the items that you choose to put underneath., If your locker doesn't have them, attach them yourself. You can find heavy duty hooks with the easy to remove adhesive in the home section or near the picture hooks at many stores. Get the ones that can hold heavier items.


If you keep workout clothes or gym shoes in your locker, you can add an adhesive air freshener to your locker to keep odors under control. Remember to change it as needed, since its life is limited.

, Order them by size, schedule, alphabetically, or by priority. Place your notebooks/binders on the top shelf of your rack. If you have any loose sheets of paper that you need, place them in a plastic folder, and put this on the second shelf. Think: heavy stuff on bottom, light on top. If you have a gym bag or purse, put that on the top as well. Or better yet, hang it from a hook.


Keep all books/binders in class order, as it helps to limit time spent at your locker.

, Carry that pencil case with you. Many pencil cases have three rings so you could also clip it into a binder to help you not forget.

, This area is easy to clean and keep fresh, whereas stacking dirty items on top of papers and clean items will make a mess.

, Don't attach these to the door as they can fall when the door is slammed shut. Instead, stick these to the back or side walls.


Put a magnetic white board to write reminders, so you don't waste paper!







, Make it your own, but don't let decorations distract you. Your locker's purpose is to hold things, not look nice.

, If you don't want to go get containers at the store, you can rummage around your house for containers that you already have. Just add some washi tape and stickers to decorate it. Examples of household containers are: plastic bins that used to hold your stuffed animals, and small metal buckets that you may find.

, This can help to keep it clean and is a good, absorbent surface for the dirtier items such as shoes.

Carpet offcuts can be obtained for free or very cheaply from carpet sellers.

, This will prevent a build up of clutter and make it easier to find things. Just take a few minutes every week and tidy up.


If you don't have time during the week, make Friday locker cleaning day.
At a minimum, clean out and reorganize your locker monthly.

, This makes it easy to grab your books/supplies when you are in a rush. Look through it for trash every time you use it; if you have an old papers or a broken pencil, just putting them in the trash helps clean your locker a lot.

Keep a small bin in your locker for trash and empty it every week. This will help keep things tidy if your school allows it and you have enough room. Use a mini trashcan; they are cute and although mini, are very helpful.

, It's easy to remember cleaning items and pens as you're looking at your items but it is easy to forget when you're leaving the house.

Don't ever be afraid to crack some jokes, people just love to be friends with someone who is funny and hilarious.

Write. Are you a poet? Flare out some of your nice work and find someone with the same hobbies.

Trendsetter. Are you someone who is making the whole class use mechanical pencils? Or are you the one that makes new trends of neon colored striped socks in the summer? Giving advice to your friends will be a very suitable job for you!

Chef. Amazing in cooking and/or baking? Bake some sweets and simple cakes and give them to your friends.;
, It will help people know that you are the smart one that they'd like to be.



Are you a visual, auditory or and kinesthetic learner? The visual learner may have a preference for seeing. Auditory learners best learn through listening. Kinesthetic learners prefer to learn via experience moving, touching, and doing. So depending on your learning style, you will learn either visually, hands on, or by listening.

Take good notes. Find cute note-pads in the dollar store, some colored pens, highlighters, post-its and stickers to help you make note taking fun and interesting!

Review your notes! This doesn't sound as easy when heard, but it really helps everyone made a good score!

Find some good exercising books. In the bookstore, you can find some nice subject exercise books, and you could ask some questions that you can't answer to your teacher.

Highlight some points. If your friends call it childish, just leave them alone. Highlight the subject points. It makes it easier to read during sudden exams.

Read challenging books. You probably have some time that you could spend to read, but you're just too lazy to do it. Just make sure it isn't so hard that you don't understand a single word that the author wrote. A research stated that children could learn and remember things better than the adults.

Learn some extra courses. Do you have some time to spend? Then why don't you take extra courses to the weakest subject you couldn't understand?

, What's wrong with having friends?



Start the conversation. Saying 'Hi' and 'Hello' isn't going to hurt you. There must be a person that will just stay quiet, but that shouldn't stop you from being popular!

Say the magic word. Everybody like a polite person, someone who knows the basic manners as such as Thank you, Please, and Sorry.

Listen to their problems. Sometimes they don't need advice, they just need you to listen and understand their current state. Smile and just tell them it will be alright!

Try your best to help them. Are they having a hard time with the new subject? Then explain it to them if you understand the point that they don't understand, and don't make fun of them.

, Nobody wants to hang around someone who is always making them feel bad.



Give compliments. Of course you like someone who compliments you, but don't overdo the compliments.

Don't criticize them with mean words. It's always nice to give someone criticize, because it will help them be better, but using harsh and hurtful words is absolutely wrong.

Be forgiving in a way. When someone asks you to forgive them or they say sorry, wait a few days to answer. This will make the person more and more eager to hear what you are going to say.

, But being up to date doesn't mean you need the latest iPad or the newest game, just know the latest news in your school or group of friends.



Watch the News. Boring? Sure it is! But watching the news with your father may help you know the latest things going on, and that can be conversation ideas right there. (Just make sure it isn't boring!)

Music. Don't just listen to Justin Bieber and Rihanna, there are many artists that you could listen to. Sure, Rihanna and Justin Bieber are very talented people, but don't limit your playlist to that! Try finding the new artists in the music industry. Who knows, you could become their biggest fan.

Who likes a bragger? People who always brag their wealth and possessions is a turn off. If you hate braggers, don't mirror what they do!.

Be humble. Being humble would make you less noticed. But rather than making a new enemy, being humble is a wise decision.

Take a compliment. When you just got an award and someone complimented you, don't shrug it off.

, Do you smell like an anchovy? Read this one, please!



Take a bath. Even just soap will make you smell beautiful if you use it right. Simply just scrub the soap two times in bath and you will smell divine. If you still want something more, buy a loofah and a nice bath gel.

Wear deodorant. After you had your period, you'll smell more easily. Even though some friends will convince you that you don't smell bad, get deodorant.

Fragrances. No matter how much it costs or where you buy it, it still will make you smell nice! For an elementary schooler, just have a fruit and flower scented fragrance. They could be found easily in the supermarket. Just make sure you don't overspray! One spray on each wrist will be good.

Mouth. It's really gross when someone has asparagus pieces stuck to their teeth, so brush after you had your meals and floss after them. You also can use mouthwash.

Make up. If you're an elementary schooler, don't wear a ton of makeup. Your skin is as smooth as silk and it can't take the cosmetic chemicals. Rather than making your skin prone to more acne, you better stay away from your sister and mother's cosmetics.

Have a ""kit"". Bring some things to your school. Dry tissues, mini sized perfume, breath freshener, and lip balm and/or lip gloss.

, Everyone is good at something!

, Gossiping, bullying, or making fun of people is a negative thing to do and a #1 thing to avoid.

, Be yourself and always be consistent. If you try too hard just to be popular, your old friends may think of you differently. Make sure that you always find the true you and never change that.

, This can be helping with carrying books, cleaning up after an activity, or helping with work. Helpful people shine in a group, and find it easier to get help for their self if they need it.

, Whether it's a nice snack, school supplies, or a vibrant smile, be willing to share.

, This doesn't mean superficial or shallow compliments, but be there to pat someone on the back when they accomplish an achievement.

, There is always a degree of competition in school, whether on grades, for attention, or in sports, and fair play is a respected and appreciated quality.

, Neither does teasing others for wearing bad clothes or having bad speech. It just gives you a ""mean kid"" reputation and you lose friends this way, unless your friends are followers.

, Make sure that you aren't mixing up your ""friends"" with your ""followers"". Followers agree with everything you do and say, and pretend to be your friend just to be popular. True friends don't always agree with you, and truly stick together with you no matter what happens, through thick and thin.

, These hair accessories are popular at school.

, Remember that you can damage your hair if you flatiron it all the time. Major curls aren't in anymore, but waves/slightly wavy/slightly curly hair are cute. In fact, most people with wavy/slightly curly hair get voted Best Hair if their hair is gorgeous.

, Shower every single day, preferably in the morning so you're fresh for school. Wash your hair, and condition your hair. Wash your face and body. Be sure to lotion up afterwards. Always wear deodorant and brush your teeth. If you want you can also start to wear some light perfume or body splash.


Don't overdo the perfume or body splash, or you may find that people are holding their noses and avoiding you.
Some girls like to shave their legs and armpits. Shaved armpits are easier to keep smelling fresh, so if you decide not to shave, wear plenty of deodorant.

, A jacket with a clear center line (e.g. a button-up jean jacket) usually looks fashionable. A jacket from a university in your state (hoodies are best) is a good addition. Make sure the jacket fits you really well all over. Ask mom or your friends from outside of your school for advice on the fit.

, Make sure all the jeans you buy are either skinny jeans or straight legged jeans. Get two nice pairs of short denim shorts that fit you really nice around the thigh and on your butt.


Wedgies and itches aren't trendy. Walk around in your jeans and shorts in the changing room to make sure they are comfortable.

, Make sure the shirts fit you really well and are super tight and cute, but not too short. Build up your collection of tee shirts, you can never have too many because they work in the summer and the winter. Get some tank tops and long sleeved shirts that flatter your figure. To make plain tee shirts look rich, get an undershirt to go under it.

, Makeup is a personal choice, and you can look great with or without it. If you want to try makeup, start small to see if you like it, then get bolder with practice. Here are some things to consider:


Facial sunscreen as a moisturizing base
Cover-up stick for acne and undereye darkness
Liquid foundation that matches your skin tone
Mineral cover up
Eye shadow and mascara

, Every morning after you're done showering, dry your hair and style it as desired. Make sure your hair is parted neatly (side parts look nice) and even consider getting some side bangs (super cute) If you have frizzy hair, get a shine serum that will smooth down all the little frizzies.


If you decide to blow-dry, flat iron, or curl your hair, spray a heat protection spray first. Too much heat styling can damage your hair.
Try adding hair clips in your hair, on the side that has the least hair on it after you part your hair. Bow clips are trendy.

, Vans are in. Tuck the laces into your shoes instead of tying them and make sure to get the no-show socks with them so you can see your socks. Get a pair of flip flops and cute sandals.

, Know your body type and coloring, so that you can choose shapes and colors that suit you. Figure out your personal taste in fashion (sporty, dressy, preppy, etc.) so you can rock clothes that make you feel confident.

, Figure out which type of accessories you love, and what is in. Accessories can add a splash of color or interest to an otherwise plain outfit. Wear things that make you feel happy. Consider:


Nerd glasses and fake Ray Bans are in.
Necklaces: try wearing a simple pendant on a silver or gold chain (depending on your coloring).
Nails: try dark polish, clear polish, or a French manicure. Keep your nails short and clean.
Bags: try alternating between several cute backpacks.

, Love blue and glitter? Get a sparkly blue phone case. Into flowers? Buy a pencil case with floral designs. Whenever you go shopping, look for things that bring out your unique style.

, Try joining one or two sports or clubs, and work hard at doing well in them. Look for people to chat with, and remember that everyone has something interesting to teach you. Participate in class and do your best at school.

, Just as you've embraced your style, others are rocking their own. Nerdy can be cool. Don't judge others based on their styles, and instead appreciate what makes them unique. If you look for the good in everyone, you'll find yourself surrounded by friends.

Wash your skin and hair daily, you deodorant and perfume, as long as they don't clash and aren't too strong.,
If your body isn't as toned as it could be, here are some tips to help.,
Become the leader.,
Take over!,
Remember someone might try to get rid of you now that your on top.",How to Be on Top of Your School," Because of the difference of becoming popular and becoming your schools ""it"" girl, you need to know what your getting yourself into. Books are MUCH better informants then television and movies, so even if you don't like reading, you should better start soon. Read for at least 20 minutes a day, you want to get an insight on what the ""it"" girls life is like. Don't worry if you get lost in a book, because some of these are really good, but try to keep your goal in sight. (spoiler alert) Two great books are: The Pretty Little Liars series (Look for Alison, Kate, Hannah, Mona and Courtney) and The Clique series, (Massie and her friends) .;
, Each school is different, what's your school's ""it"" group like? Are they all dedicated athletes, cheerleaders, do they have certain talents, or one thing in common? Try to figure out what it is and imitate it. Do they all have blond hair, have they all won art awards. Remember, if you want to lead them you must differentiate yourself a small bit. If they all dance, maybe you can sing?

, ""it"" girls often have these two things down. If your style is sweats and a baggy t-shirt that just WON'T do. figure out some of their favorite stores and shop there, if you don't have the cash look for similar styles in less expensive stores. For your hair, Long straight, glossy hair always works. You are going to need a straightener, curling iron, blow dryer, and actually spend time working on your hair each morning. Heat protectant spray is a great helper, because who wants great hair that smells like burnt toast? If your hair is short, or just generally pain and unfashionable, get a new cut and color, highlights are a great way to brighten up drab hair.

, Yes, most ""it"" girls wear makeup. Think: the right amount applied artfully. Magazines and online tutorials are great help, and make sure to chose colours that complement your eye and skin tones well. Highlight your best feature, and allow the rest of your makeup to be a little less elaborate.

, When you begin to meet and interact with ""it"" girls at your school, make sure you act, confident, a little quiet, and calm. Don't be all devious,and be all ""hey let's go insult some random chick to prove I'm like you!"". If they have some devious plans follow along, but stay in the background. If Lies, secrets, and hurting others happens to be a part of their life, it's now part of yours. Once they know you better you can start to take the lead.

, if your teeth aren't white, buy whitening strips, if they are crooked, Invisalign are just like invisible braces. Have good breath too, brush your teeth twice daily.

, Cut back on your servings, you only need about half the portion size that people actually give you. Eat slowly, don't inhale your food or you won't know when to stop. Fruits and veggies are better then fat and sugar, eat healthy. Exercise, if you don't play a sport there are still many other things you can do. Take daily jogs, with your new ""it"" pals, or with a dog or whatever, join a yoga, aerobics, or pilates class, join a gym. Many gyms have decent prices, especially if you go more than twice a week. A video set is another option, I recommend P90X and 10 minute trainer, by Tony Horton. He knows his fitness!

, Once the group has accepted you as their own. Start to become a little more vocal. Think of fun, cool, and exciting activities to do, the first couple with the leader and then, completely without. Make sure you have all the girls, but her, with you, and that she has little or no contact with them while you guys are out. Talk about your experiences at school, if the leader asks why she wasn't invited, make sure to tell her that you really wanted her there, but the other girls, told her not to let you and made you promise not to tell. If the girls ask why she wasn't invited, say that the leader was talking about them to you, and you didn't want them to be hurt. You need to have one true friend in the group that you be super nice too and care about, she will soon be your beta. Yes with popularity comes lies and betrayal.

, Do one dangerous activity with the leader alone. Get her to steal someone's boyfriend, sneak into a bar, go out skinny dipping anything to get her friends to hate her. Make sure she gets busted and get it on video. Post it on Facebook, Myspace, YouTube, and make sure it gets lots of views! Tell the group that you don't want her bad rep ruining all your reputations, and making people start to dislike you because you were friends with her. Say she been doing stuff like this for a while, and that it was only a matter of time before she was caught. Pretend you're sad and have the others console you. Make sure you all ignore her and never hang out with her. Do extra fun activities and throw awesome parties with your new BFFs and, anything else like more lies and pranks you want.

, Your new world is full of drama lies and peer pressure, you're a bully a liar, and untrustworthy. Was all this worth it?

Get a clean appearance.,

Be friendly to everybody!,
Have some self confidence.,
Smile.,
Look alive!,
Dress to impress.,
Don't be too much of a flirt with too many guys.",How to Be Hot in High School," Dirty, unwashed hair, unbrushed teeth, etc. makes you seem very unappealing. That's why it's important to shower and keep clean. Use a good shampoo and conditioner. If you straighten your hair, get a heat protection product to prevent breakage. A hydrating product is good for virtually any hair type. It doesn't always have to be expensive... Herbal Essences is fabulous!;
, This means not dressing trashy: show the world that you can be beautiful without showing too much cleavage. It is acceptable to dress flirty, but there is a fine line between tasteful and trashy.

, This doesn't necessarily mean you have to be BEST friends with every person in the school, but being nice in general will only increase your attractiveness. Remember, QUALITY, not QUANTITY. A few good, supportive friends who you truly trust are better than a thousand friends who tear you down.

, A less attractive girl who walks briskly with her head held high stands out more than a pretty girl who slumps when she walks. Learn how to strut down the hallways with grace and confidence! Place one foot in front of the other, and only wear heels if you can walk without looking awkward in them! Flip flops and ballet flats are cute, but don't be afraid to express your own style!

, Smiling makes you seem friendlier and more approachable. You can use whitening strips or trays or a whitening toothpaste to get a winning smile. Use a pink lip gloss - the blue hues in it will make your teeth appear whiter. Also, make sure your lips are never chapped - chapped lips are very unappealing.

, Whether or not you're into wearing makeup, you don't want to look like you just crawled out of bed. The cardinal rules of makeup are: concealer under the eyes, mascara on the lashes, and gloss on the lips. But it's not limited to just that! If you have small eyes, you can apply a white liner to your waterline and a black or brown liner on your upper and lower lashlines. Stop about halfway in (or to where your lashes start to thin) and your eyes will instantly look larger. For those with larger eyes, apply a dark colored liner all the way in on your water line. This will draw the eye out and make it look longer and well... sexy! For those of you who prefer not to wear makeup, placing cold spoons under your eyes for 10 minutes will reduce the dark circles without any makeup.

, Pinks and reds stand out. Believe it or not, blacks and greys can be just as loud when worn correctly. Try a black shirt or black v-neck with a chunky necklace or a large belt. When shopping, try finding things that no one else will have... unique is good!

, People will get the wrong opinion and you may be taken advantage of. Be nice, but firm and stand your ground... you don't want to be a tease!

Start with a person with lower popularity and work your way up. Starting with people on the lower rungs helps you gain access to the group. Plus, these less popular people may be excited that you are showing them attention. Make their day.
Don't be fake. That is definitely not cool. You want to make good friends, not superficial acquaintances that you will drop. If you get into that habit, people will start to think of you that way. You don't want to hurt your reputation.;
, Don't focus so much on one popular clique that you end up not making friends with anyone else. There are a lot of people in your school. Make sure you are nice to everyone! The more people you get to know, the more people you befriend, the more popular and cool you will become.


The first impression always count. Show your true self, and don't try to fake who you really are.
Make friends with people in grades above you and grades below you. Befriend people in different cliques. Get to know the popular kids, but talk to the kids on the soccer team, the drama clique, and the kids with the rock band. Making friends and getting to know a lot of people will help you increase your coolness. It will help get your name out there more.
Making friends with a lot of people can help you figure out which group you want to be part of. Becoming part of a social group, whether it's the jocks, the musicians, the popular kids, or the brains, helps foster a sense of belonging., One way to be cool and increase your popularity is to join clubs. Choose clubs that interest you, like drama club or maybe student council. What clubs are the popular people in? If there are people you want to be friends with, try joining the club they are part of.


Clubs will help you meet people. As you get involved in club activities, like theater productions and student council elections, your name will get out there so people will start recognizing who you are. This helps increase your coolness, because you'll be that guy in the fall production or that girl who won student council secretary.
Don't join a club you will hate being part of just to be friends with someone. You want to be part of things you will enjoy. Don't be a poser because people will be able to tell if you are faking liking something.
Don't join everything. You don't want to spread yourself too thin or be a show off.

, Most high school athletes are automatically cool, just on principle. Think about what sport is cool in your school. Is it lacrosse, soccer, football, or baseball? Try out for the team. Just make sure you are prepared for the dedication and physical exertion. Also make sure you can play the game. You don't want to humiliate yourself at tryouts.


Are all the popular girls cheerleaders? Consider joining cheer leading. If they are all playing field hockey, play field hockey. Make sure to befriend the players once you make the team.
If you are not interested in joining the team, then get involved other ways. Go to home games. Many popular cliques will go to football games on Friday nights. Join them. Get involved with booster clubs and student council pep rallies.
Sports are a great way to make new friends and learn teamwork. They also help keep you in shape and look good on college applications., Once you start sitting with people at lunch or hanging out with cool kids, bring food to share with them. This is a way to start a conversation and start interacting with people in a low stress environment.


Keep it simple, though. Don't make cookies. Instead, if you have a bag of chips, offer them up. After you open then, just simply ask, ""Want some chips?"" Don't make a big deal about it. Keep it simple, keep it cool., Figure out who throws the best parties and go to those parties. Go with a group of friends. If you go alone, then mingle and meet people. Have fun and enjoy yourself while at the parties.


Don't drink and do drugs at parties to be cool. Drugs and drinking underage are illegal. More than that, you don't want to be the sloppy drunk or high person who embarrasses herself. Instead, stay sober so you can act cool and not make a fool of yourself. Plus, it helps you stay out of trouble.
Don't have sex at parties to try to be cool. You should only have sex if you are ready. Having sex with someone because you think they will make you cool can only end in disaster. Instead, flirt with people, date around, and even make out. You just don't want to end up labeled as a player or a slut.
To avoid pressure at parties, try to not to draw attention to yourself when others are doing things you feel uncomfortable with. Walk to another room if you have to. Don't give in and do things that make you feel uncomfortable to fit in with a group., Being cool doesn't mean being mean or cruel. Smile at people. Speak to them. Be nice to people who are less cool or in other cliques than yours. When you date people, make sure that you like them. Don't just date people to gain popularity and then dump them. Be a nice, genuine person so people will like you., When trying to be cool, don't give up your principles. Remember, you've got to live with your choices. Things you do in high school affect your college acceptance and can influence your future. Don't sacrifice what you know feels right just to be cool.


Don't get bad grades. Most cool kids aren't the ones who are failing their classes. Maybe they're not the smartest or the valedictorian, but they get good grades. The cool, popular kids want to go to good colleges because they want good jobs that will make them money. Don't sacrifice your grades to make yourself look good.
Don't get into trouble. Some cool kids understand when to break the rules and when not to. But getting into fights, doing drugs, drinking, and being intentionally rude to teachers is not the way to gain cool points. A lot of cool, popular kids are actually the teacher's pets. This lets them get away with more in their classes because the teachers like them., The key to being cool is to not try so hard. Cool people don't push; they're not needy. While working on your coolness, try dialing everything back a bit. Don't be too eager or too excitable.Don't fidget. When talking to people, stay cool, calm, and collected. Don't mess with your hair, adjust your shirt, or bite your lip. Try not to flail your arms around. You want to exude coolness, not nervous energy. Take a deep breath before talking, then speak slowly and deliberately. Try not to say ""um"" too much.
Be a bit aloof. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't speak to people, be interested when someone speaks, or smile. It just means that you shouldn't wave excitedly when you see the coolest kid in class. Don't run up to someone and starts rambling. Play it cool. Nod your head, smile, and say hello. Remember - less is more.Don't try too hard to be liked, to be accepted, or to be known. Don't care so much about those things. Leave the obsessing to other people. Keep your focus on staying cool, calm, and collected., When you walk down the halls, don't scream, yell, or laugh too loud. You don't want to be that person everyone rolls their eyes at because they can hear your conversation all the way down the hall. Talk at a normal volume. When you laugh, don't go overboard. Try not to laugh too loud or snort., Being cool is about being yourself. Posers, copycats, and wannabes are never cool. You want to be unique, be yourself, and keep your own interests. However, since you are concerned with coolness, you want to make sure not to go overboard. High school has never been kind to those individuals who are such an individual that they are in their own world. Save that kind of stuff for college.


Unfortunately, this might mean downplaying certain aspects of yourself. Are you into manga, video games, or pop culture? Do you like death metal, goth culture, or veganism? If so, decide how much of your true personality you can share and not alienate your peers. Will they stop talking to you if you talk about manga all the time? Are they going to think you're weird if you start wearing all black?
If you truly want to be cool and fit in, try not to experiment too much. Part of the key for being cool in high school is to be like the majority.
Try to find a balance between being yourself and not pushing your classmates away by things they don't understand., Think about what most cool people in movies and TV have in common: they are confident. They know they are cool, they like themselves, and they don't need to find validation through other people. Having confidence helps you not try too hard, which is definitely not cool.


Most people don't have an innate confidence. Instead, they fake it. Fake your confidence until you start to believe it.Have a mantra you repeat to yourself. Say to yourself, ""I am awesome/beautiful/kind/smart/funny/etc."" Say it in your head, post it in your locker - whatever works for you., Sites like Instagram and Twitter can help you increase your cool factor. When using Twitter, don't talk about other people. Instead, make your tweets funny and interesting. Be witty. Don't flood your feed. Instagram can be another great way to garner some cool points and increase your popularity.


Post when you know people are going to be on. Evenings and Sunday afternoons are good times when high schoolers aren't busy doing other things.
Don't post too often. Once again, the idea of less is more is important here. You don't want to flood people's Instagram feed or bore them. You want to intrigue them with your life. Post once or twice a week. Make sure those posts are good ones. Don't just post pictures of your food or your cat.
Post selfies sparingly. Don't be that girl who always posts a selfie with duck face, or the guy who posts a shirtless selfie. Keep the selfies spontaneous, like when you're at a cool place or out with friends.
Follow people. Like their photos, make sure they know who you are so they can follow you back. But make sure your follower-to-follows ratio is about even. You don't want to look like the person who follows everyone but who no one follows back. Unfollow people who refuse to follow you back.
Have fun with Instagram. Post flattering pictures of yourself, pictures where you're doing fun things, and pictures that show you have an interesting life., Being cool doesn't mean following all the new fashion trends. Instead, take a look around and see what all the cool kids are wearing. What fashions are in style at your school? Shop from the stores the cool kids do and try to emulate their looks.Don't be a complete fashion copycat. Put your own individual twist onto the outfits. Wear accessories or shoes you want to, get shirts in the color you prefer, or wear styles you feel comfortable in. The key to dressing the right way is feeling comfortable and owning what you wear.
Don't go overboard with fashion. Dress simply. Too many fashion trends in one outfit will make you look like a mess. Instead, opt for one trendy piece with an otherwise simple outfit.

, Being smelly, having dirty hair, and not taking care of yourself is not cool. You don't have to have the perfect body, but you want to take care of yourself. This ensures that you present the best you to your peers.


Take regular showers. You want to make sure that you keep your body clean, along with your hair and face. Brush your teeth before school every morning. Wear deodorant. Don't wear so much cologne and perfume that people can't stand next to you.

Be approachable.,
Start a conversation.,
Be their protector, if they need one.,
Introduce your new friend to your other friends.,
Ask your new friend to tell you about their life and what they like doing.,
Listen to them when they speak.,
Give them your number.,
Become friends on Facebook or another social media website.

,
Get to know the person a bit more.,
Ask them over.,
Become great friends.,
Learn your new friend's flaws.",How to Be Friends with the Weird Kid," Let the ""weird"" kid know you're friendly. If there's a kid who isn't exactly the same as everyone else in school, they may be used to being treated unkindly by people and not initially realize your kind intentions. Tell them you are friendly and let them that you are not a bully or a mean sort of person.;
, Start simply by saying something nice like, ""Nice shirt"" or ""Cool shoes."" You can also easily start a conversation by just saying, ""I noticed your bag/shoes/earrings/glasses/anything"". If you say this, rather than just give a compliment, the chances are the other person will say, ""What did you notice about my --?"" You can answer their question and keep the conversation going. If you just say, ""Neat hat,"" then the other person may reply just by saying ""thanks"", which is not much of a conversation.


Giving compliments is always nice; nearly everyone likes to get a compliment, but saying what you noticed is a better opener, and, you can even say it if you only noticed something because you didn't like it. Just be tactful and say, ""I noticed it because I've never seen one like that before,"" rather than saying how horrible you think the item is! Not everyone likes the same things, but there's no need to share your opinions when you're trying to make new friends.

, If someone else says something mean, stand up for your new friend. Good friends do that for each other. No one should pick on any one else just because they think they are weird. We are all weird to someone! Everyone is different from everyone else in how they look and what they think and like or don't like. Some people are similar to each other, and sometimes people are really different.


There's really no such thing as normal and no such thing as weird. Weird would be 150 people who were all identical! Creepy! Be accepting of differences in others and stand up for everyone against bullies and ignorant people.

, Tell them a little bit about each of your friends when you do the introductions. Try to mention anything that your new friend has in common with your established friends. For example, if the ""weird"" kid likes soccer, and your buddy does too, say, ""X, this is Y, he's into soccer too,"" or, ""If the new kid has a Halloween Kitty Homework Binder, say, ""A, this is B, she has a Halloween Kitty lunch bag.""

, Try not to pry. If you find it weird that someone wears dark glasses all the time, for example, don't ask straight away about it. Your new friend may be sensitive about an eye problem. Ask about their family, What classes they like, what music they are into and that sort of stuff. Tell your friend a little about yourself too. It doesn't matter if you are total opposites and don't like any of the same things; you can still be friends! If you can't find something you both like to talk about, then try bonding about something you both don't like, even if it's something a bit silly or trivial, such as school meatloaf, math tests, or spiders!

, Some people are shy, and some have a stammer or other speech problems, so be patient and listen carefully. If, sadly, generally people aren't very nice to this seemingly ""weird kid,"" then they may not be very used to having friendly conversations and might be a bit awkward. Be encouraging and reassure your new friend that you want to be friends and get along with them.

, Tell them to call you. You can learn a lot from them when you talk more and they may find it easier to talk when you're not face to face.

,, Talk a few times to get to know each other; you won't become friends after one quick chat in the lunch queue!

, Give them your address and ask them over to your place.

, Try to know that person in and out. You will eventually not even remember why you thought they were weird!

, Flaws can make a friendship weaker, so try to know them first and then they should be less of an issue. But remember that everybody has flaws and that it doesn't have to be a bad thing."

Eat healthy.,
Exercise.,
Sleep well.",How to Be an Athletic Elementary School Girl1,"  Do not eat junk food.  If you want to eat it, only eat a little bit, and never replace healthy, balanced meals with junk food.  Only snack on junk food in moderation.  Eat foods from all the food groups, and try to get the recommended daily servings for your age.  Fruits and veggies should be eaten often, and water too!;
,  Be physically active for at least one hour a day.  It doesn't have to be all at once, you can spread your exercise throughout the day.  For example, go outside and ride your bike for 15 minutes.  Swing on the swing set at the park for 15 minutes, and play a 30 minute game of soccer!  Exercising will improve your health a lot.

,  It is recommended that you get 10-11 hours of sleep nightly. Without sleep, you become less energetic, you get dark circles and unhealthily pale skin, and you just feel a lot drowsier.  8 hours of sleep minimum, will pay off!

Straighten your back and smile.,
Cultivate confidence.,
Look for new friends.,
Recognize that not everyone will be your friend, and that's okay.,
Ask people questions.,
Enjoy what you have.,
Get involved.",How to Be a Popular Transgender Person in High School1," Stand tall and show your pride in who you are. Imagine if you looked flawless... what would your posture be like? Now adopt that posture. Any time you find yourself slinking back to un-confident body language in the halls, remind yourself how fabulously attractive you are, and go back to your awesome walk.


It's okay if you don't feel fabulously attractive. Keep telling yourself, and keep pretending you are. Eventually, you'll believe it. You can shine.

, There's a good chance you've learned to be resourceful and quick in order to protect yourself from the insults you've already heard. Use that quick and agile thinking, and put forth a calm, confident appearance. Others are drawn to confident, funny people. Look around - the most attractive people are not with the most handsome partners. They're with the funny and kind ones. Funny is money - use humor to help defuse tense situations, and you'll draw people in.

, Be friendly and compassionate to others, and practice random acts of kindness. View each person as a potential new friend, and react to them in the most positive way. Usually, when you treat people well, they will also treat you well.

, Your personality won't ""click"" with everyone, and that's natural and not a bad reflection on you. Don't assume it's because you are transgender.


If you don't wind up with the traditional ""in-crowd,"" that's all right. That clique is hard to crack for anyone. There is no need to push it. Seek out other interesting and fun people and be popular in your own way.
Some people are legitimate jerks. This is because they are bad, and it has nothing to do with you. They are not worth your time.

, People love to talk about themselves, so ask them questions to keep the conversation flowing about what they like. Show that you are interested in what they have to say.


After leaving a conversation, try mentally summing it up. ""So Jordan's puppy Spots is teething, and he's trying to get her not to bite before he introduces her to his girlfriend."" This way you are more likely to recall the details later, and Jordan will be pleased you remembered.

, Focus on the upsides: the sweet girl you talked to today, your success in Spanish class, or your father's kindness. Reflecting upon the positives can help you stay afloat during the negatives.

, Try joining clubs, doing volunteer activities, joining a sports team, and/or joining an LGBT+ group. Find your interests, and search for a group centered around those interests. This will help you meet people who share your talents and passions, and you can make great new friendships.

Have a pair of pearl or diamond earrings at hand.",How to Be a Popular Prep/Trendy Girl," Floral print, peter pan collars, riding boots, feathers, over-sized bags etc. Pick some of your favorites and see some prices before you go shopping, and see if there are any new trends which catch your eye.
, What about 5 new Polos in some cute colors? Sea blue, candy floss pink, grass green, and maybe a fun burgundy and navy for those lazy days? Then some chinos in maybe 2 different colors, though light brown is a must with turn ups at the bottom. Maybe some shirts or blouses for lunch? Some posh dresses, floral accessories, riding boots? The choice is up to you! Make sure some classic clothing is paired with some trends for that effortless trendy look., Wear a mascara in either brown, black or clear. Pair with a hint of bronzer and lip gloss for that `I've done nothing to this face!` look. Buy into products that you've tried or close people to you have tried., Chanel No.5 is a good choice, as are some others which include DKNY, Britney Spears or Juicy Couture. Chanel is probably the best choice, though., If they are not real, make sure they don't look fake. I also suggest buying a pearl necklace and a diamond ring, and as a hint of trendiness, a Juicy Couture bracelet."

Stretch daily.,
Run fast.,
Do playground strength training.",How to Be an Athletic Elementary School Girl2,"  Stretching not only feels good, it will help improve your flexibility, quicker than you think it could.  Stretch out all the muscles in your body, and get them ready for all the sports that you play.  Yoga is soothing and beneficial.

,  In order to run fast, wear a good, high-quality pair of runners.  Make sure the shoelaces are tied if your shoes have them!  Tripping is extremely hazardous, even though you may have never tripped.  Always have your upper body in front of your lower body, and take big, fast steps with your feet.  Don't ball up your fists, instead let them loose and swing them back for better momentum, which will make you fast.

,  It sounds ridiculous, but you are getting stronger everyday by running, jumping, climbing, and more on the playground!  Whenever you are making an effort to work your muscles, you are making them stronger.  So even if you may be weak, if you keep on running, jumping, and playing, you'll get strong.

Participate in gym class.,
Know how to catch and throw balls effectively.,
Master at least 1 sport.",How to Be an Athletic Elementary School Girl3,"  It's understandable that you're afraid of the basketball that gave you a bleeding nose last year, but you must understand that sports aren't meant to scare you or make you get hurt, it's just a disadvantage that comes with playing it.  Sure you may get a few bruises, but you will heal.  Try your best and move it!

,  When you see a ball coming your way, unless it's dodgeball and you don't think you can catch the ball, put your hands out and focus your eyes on the ball. Once it's in your hands, don't hold that position.  Clasp the ball in your hands tightly.  This will take practice.  To throw a ball, grab it firmly with your fingers on one or both hands, but your arm(s) back like a slingshot, and throw all your strength to the front of you and let go of the ball.  Tada!  You are now a master.

,  You have to master or be extremely good at one sport to be called ""athletic"".  It does not have to be a team sport if you are not rather competitive.  Biking is a sport, rock climbing is a sport.  Practice that sport almost everyday or everyday if you have the time to spare.  Practice makes perfect, so fight!

Wear comfortable, loose clothes.,
Hair.,
Hygiene.",How to Be an Athletic Elementary School Girl4,"  You don't want to wear jeans while playing a sport.  Always wear loose and baggy clothes when you're not playing a sport, but when you are, wear comfortable and stretchy but skin tight clothes that complement your figure.  Try not to wear anything too girly or over the top.  Look presentable.

,  Wash your hair everyday if you play sports that require you to move a lot (most sports), because your hair is going to be sopping wet, and not on purpose, after ever sport you play.  If you don't sweat as much, wash your hair every other day to every 3 days.  Style your hair in a bun, ponytail, braid, or just natural and left down.

,  Shower or bathe daily, and scrub your body well, with body wash or soap.  You should feel fresh and clean after every soak you take.  Brush your teeth twice daily, and floss, which is recommended.  Wear clean clothes too.

Don't be mad at yourself for staying in the closet.,
Remember that nobody is analyzing you as closely as you analyze yourself.,
Recognize that even if people do notice something, they're unlikely to comment on it.,
Pay special attention to self care.",How to Be a Popular Transgender Person in High School2," Safety, acceptance, etc. are perfectly valid reasons not to come out, and you are not obligated to educate anyone. Your health comes first, and if that means not mentioning that you're transgender, that's okay.;
, Most high schoolers are absorbed in their own lives and dramas, so if you don't quite perform your gender perfectly, they won't notice or think much of it.

, If you're a girl with a slightly deep voice or a short guy, politeness will keep most people from pressing further.


Guys do tease each other about perceived weakness, a.k.a. femininity, and you may be on the receiving end if you're a trans guy. You can shrug it off as good-natured teasing, or if it bothers you, take the teaser aside in private and explain that it's kind of a sore spot and you'd like him to stop.

, You might feel gnawed at by worries that you don't pass, or saddled with dysphoria at needing to pretend to be someone whom you aren't. This is difficult, and it will be stressful at times.

Surround yourself with accepting people and disclose everything to them.,
Be prepared to do some explaining.,
Look for people's second reactions, not their first.,
Don't take it personally if you run across some jerks.",How to Be a Popular Transgender Person in High School3," Take your time in deciding when to take people into your confidence, and if it makes you more comfortable, choose just one person to divulge your secrets to first. This person can help pave the way to being honest with your whole group, and can help be a bridge to understanding between you and them.

, Most high schoolers don't know the difference between sex and gender, simply because nobody has taught it to them. They may be a little awkward at first, but that is because this is new to them, not because anything is wrong or bad about you.


Educating people can be tiring. It helps to come up with a ""script"" that you can rattle off anytime, and to have a website URL or two that you can encourage people to check out in order to learn more.

, Having their ideas of gender overturned can be a little shocking, and they might react less positively than you hoped. Take a deep breath and give them a little time. Once they've had a little time to process, they will show their true colors.


If they realize that they overreacted and apologize, then it means they probably do support you and are worth your trust.
If it has been a week and they're still not accepting you, then it probably isn't going to happen. They don't have the strength to accept you.

, It happens, and it's their loss. Any cruel or cold actions are not a reflection upon you.


Unfortunately, some people won't like you because you are transgender. Remind yourself that sometimes people get scared or angry when they see someone who is braver than they are.
These people usually have some deep-seated issues of their own, and they aren't as brave as you are. Instead of blaming yourself, pity them. They simply can't be as awesome as you.

Take plenty of time to relax.,
Remember that you do not need to shoulder the burden of perfection.,
Immerse yourself in positive transgender media.,
Make LGBTQIA friends.",How to Be a Popular Transgender Person in High School4," Your emotional health matters, so spend lots of time hanging out with people who make you happy and/or engaging in hobbies that help you feel at peace.

, It isn't fair to expect you to be an ambassador of transgender people, especially not when you are so young. No one is entitled to anything from you. Any educational or anti-discrimination efforts on your part are your choice, and you are not obligated.


Check yourself to make sure you aren't holding yourself to impossible standards. You should not expect yourself to constantly be a smiling, talking Trans 101 encyclopedia. Not every interaction needs to be a perfect educational moment.
If educating others is exhausting you, then by all means, give yourself a break. Say the magic words ""Go look it up"" and do something fun for a change.

, Read webcomics such as The Princess and Rain, watch Orange is the New Black (if you are okay with R ratings), look at the work of transgender artists, and immerse yourself in transgender stories as told by transgender people. Representation matters, and it can really help to see fictional people who are just like you.


Don't just look for professional artists; a lot of amateurs also post worthwhile work.

, Look for transgender friends, but also other LGB+ people. There may be a club at school, a local support group, or a website (e.g. Tumblr) where you can meet others like you. They can understand you in a way that cisgender heterosexuals can't. Support each other, and know that you're not alone.

Lots of pencils and pens.






Scissors, rulers, glue sticks, glue bottle, markers, crayons etc.






At least 3 spiral and composition notebooks for different classes.






Notebook paper. Some schools require College Ruled or Wide Ruled, check with your school first.

, You don't want to wear the same thing every day, right? You don't have to have the coolest American Eagle clothing but at least have some of these. If your parents are very strict, just say, ""Hey Mom, I saw this really cool tank-top on the American Eagle website"" and maybe go to the mall and check it out. You should have a variety of tees, tank-tops, jeans, hoodies, sweaters etc. Accessories look good too. Cheap places to get clothing are Forever 21, Target and Boscov's.

, Brush your teeth at least twice a day. Shower everyday, wash your hair at least once a week. Use shampoo on the top part of your hair, and use conditioner for the bottom. Floss everyday. You can wear perfume and body spray because no one will like a girl that smells stinky after gym right?

, Use mascara, light skin color eye shadow, concealer, and lip gloss. Don't use any more than this. If you use too much, it distracts from your natural beauty. You're young!

, You can get top brands like UGGS, but they are very expensive. But some other brands have their own ""uggs"". Converse shoes are in fashion right now. If you can't offer Allstar, you can get some cheap airwalk. Flipflops and sandals are musts. Flats are also okay.

, If you slunk in the classroom, others will be like, ""oh my god, she is so not confident."" Walk in like you are walking on the red carpet. They'll know that you aren't scared even if you are on the inside. Also, smile. Really smile. Your smile will always look great.

But if somebody is suspicious that you were secretly wishing that Sally would forget to study for the test so that you could get the best score in the class for once, don't try to sell a lie. Instead of saying ""Sally is such a teacher's favourite! No wonder she always get such good scores."" say ""I'm disappointed with myself because I know I could've done better."";
, Maintain eye contact with the person who is speaking and throw in the occasional nod or ""hmm"" but not to the point where it becomes distracting or disruptive. Whatever you do, don't interrupt the person who is speaking. This shows that you think what you're about to say is more important than what they are saying.

, There will be people out there who will never click with you, that's just life. However, you don't need to make it a negative; simply leave such people be. They've got other things to ruminate about than your existence in their lives.

, They like you when you're funny. Try to tell some jokes. But not always, they might get annoyed and think you're a clown. If they already have this thought, try to be serious and don't tell jokes for few days. This will make them think you maybe was just happy because of something good that happened to you, so you could be more popular again.

, Now that you have major influence at your school, encourage your peers to make better and right choices.

, Join a sports team or club; you’ll meet more people once you start moving around. Don’t get involved in activities that you don’t enjoy just to be popular, be yourself.

, Ask about what people are interested in; people are generally confident talking about what they love. Make sure that you talk about things that people want to hear but don’t gossip because it can hurt other people’s feelings. Take it slow.If you’re shy to communicate with others,speak in shorter sentences.


Respect other people’s privacy, don’t brag on about yourself or constantly ask questions. Popular people can hold friendly conversations most of the time. Don’t be annoying and make other people feel uncomfortable.







, If you are a leader in something, like activities, throw class events. Bring your radio and music. Popular girls love music and dancing. Ask them what they want to be in the ""party"". This will make them think you care about their opinion and they will think you're cool.


If you throw a party in your house, make it look cool. The look is important. So is the movie you wanna see. Choose a movie they like. Something on trend, something new.
Make sure your outfit is perfect. Everybody will talk about your sleepover or your party, which will help your popularity.
If the party doesn't go well, say ""sorry"". If you make as nothing happened that will make them think you don't care about it. Saying sorry is better than standing and making as nothing happened. After saying ""sorry"", do something they like and think it is fun.

, If you don't have one already, get a cell phone to stay in touch with people; also get a Facebook, Twitter, and/or Instagram account if you are able to. Post funny things that people like. You might blog too. Make sure that you write something interesting and creative. But it need to be true. Make sure do does not post secrets that might humiliate you. That would make you less popular.

, Consider swimming, yoga or dancing, it’s important that you feel comfortable in with your body. Don’t always cover yourself in makeup because you’re not showing your natural beauty this way.

, Get some fashion advice from magazines, be inspired. Shop at shops that you like, you can find some stores online as well. Don’t wear clothes that you don’t feel comfortable in.

, This may seem superficial, but popularity is about setting trends, doing something differently and making it instantly cool. One way of doing this is through style, but if what you're trying to sell is stupid or seriously uncool, don't do it. If you have a spec of doubt about whether other people will actually want to wear it, don't wear it yourself. You could risk damaging your reputation. Also, as soon as the trend has caught on, change your look so that your peers can never catch up with your ever changing style. And it's okay to go back to a few looks which had major results, that's how fashion works.


Be a fashion-focused person. Be the first who follow the new fashion. Try to wear different clothes. They will understand it's on fashion and will wear that outfit too.Then, after you become popular they will follow only your lead. So, you have to be on the fashion. You don't have to have all designer clothes, but put effort into what you have on. Try to stand out a little without going too far.






Share clothes. Girls like sharing clothes, so share some with your friends. They think it's fun doing it.






Standing out is always a way of becoming popular quickly. If somebody spots you wearing something that is not common, it will attract attention.







, Shower every day, wash your hair twice a week, brush your teeth and wash your face twice a day. You can also wear a little perfume if you want. Try to use an organic deodorant as non-organic deodorants have been linked to breast and lymphatic cancer.


Wear antiperspirant/deodorant and perhaps a little perfume.







, Use colour, get an edgy haircut or put in extensions to make your hair longer. Dye your hair a dramatic color and be willing to change your image, think positive and be creative with what you do with your hair. You could run the straighteners through your hair or the curlers; you could even crimp your hair or braid it!

, Now apply some liquid foundation with a sponge, apply concealer on your flaws. Next curl your lashes and apply a thick coat of mascara, don’t forget your lower lashes! Apply your blush, and then apply some lipstick. Now you’re finished!

Stay in style.,
Get decent quality shoes.,
Keep clean.,
Use lip gloss only.,
Let people know you're friendly by smiling and being respectful.,
Communicate well.,
Get high grades.,
Get involved in school activities.,
Be good at both sports and schoolwork.",How to Be a Popular Girl in Elementary School," Try to get name brand clothing. However, name brands aren't everything and now is a great time to realize that an astute shopper can buy very affordable quality items by knowing that fabric and stitching quality are important things to focus on, not the label alone.


Avoid clothing that can be easily identified as cheap.;
, They should be comfortable, well made and long-lasting. Spending a little more on a quality shoe can keep your feet in good condition for the year and the shoes will last longer.

, Stay fresh by using deodorant. Brush your teeth twice a day and brush your hair, too. Keep your hair well brushed. Have a bath or shower every day.

, That should do the trick for makeup. Too much makeup can make you look like a clown and spoil your dewy young skin that doesn't need a drop of makeup. Even lip gloss isn't essential, so if you don't want it, that's fine.

, Be nice and appreciate them. Try to compliment others. Telling a person their hair looks good or you like their shoes will make them happy and want to hang out with you more.


Dont be self-centered, remember other people have feelings too.

, Be polite, thoughtful and funny. Complaining all the time or being a gossip will scare people off. Be a cheerful sort of person, but realistic and helpful too.


Don't swear or act inappropriately. Do not put anyone down, even if they make you angry.
Don't act too hyper as it can make people feel uncomfortable. Have an even and mild manner most of the time, although it's fine to be excited sometimes.

, This will make things easiest for you at school and others will respect your ability to get work done well.

, Choose a sport or two that you enjoy and become involved in it regularly.

, Doing both won't classify you as a nerd or an athlete. It will help people too see you as diverse and easy to be around. You can do more than one thing, you adapt.

"
"
Start off with the toiletries.,
Be sure to have the right types of tops.,
Be aware that for bottoms, it's OKAY to wear the same pairs of shorts multiple times during the cruise, most people do - and it would be crazy to waste money on 7 pairs of shorts.,
Don't forget a few dresses.,
For shoes, don't bring every pair of shoes in your closet.,
Have something to fix up your hair.,
Always bring sunglasses, especially if it's a summer cruise.,
Hats (optional).,
Don't forget your swimming suit(s).,
Don't forget the extras.,
Makeup (optional).,
Bring some of your own money.,
Be sure to have a few Snacks.",How to Pack for a Cruise if You're a Teenage Girl," And no, we don't mean toilet paper (there will be plenty on the cruise). Be sure to pack:


Toothbrush, Toothpaste
Soap, Body wash
Shampoo and Conditioner (they provide you with this on the cruise, but bring your own if you only use a specific shampoo brand)
Q-tips/cotton balls, Nail file
Floss
Shower cap (optional because these are also provided)
Tweezers, Bug spray
Deodorant, Facial Cleanser
Perfume or Body Spray
Lip Balm
Moisturizer
Razors (disposable)
Hair products
Sunscreen (very important)
Don't forget about pads or tampons, because you never know what might happen, so it's always important to take precautions.
Don't forget to bring underwear, bandeaus (important if you are wearing low-cut tank tops), bras (at least one strapless one), thin tank tops that go under your clothes, and other undergarments.;
, Since most cruises last around a week, you'll be needing enough clothes for that time. However, you will often find yourself changing your clothes multiple times throughout the day for special occasions or because of the weather, so be sure to pack extras. You should bring at least:


6 T-shirts
4-5 Tank tops/Camis (2 is fine)
2 Sweaters
2 or more dressy but semi-casual tops (such as one shouldered tops)
One long sleeved shirt
Cardigans (to wear over tank tops and dresses)
One hoodie
At least 2 formal tops
One plain white t-shirt (never know when it might come in handy)
One 3 quarter length blouse (Take in account that you do not need to pack all of these tops, but it can be often chilly on the cruise.

, So I recommend:


3 to 4 pairs of shorts (blue and white as an absolute must). Depending on what type of shorts you prefer, you can pack short-shorts, mid-sized, or even the Bermuda shorts.
If you are the athletic type, be sure to bring gym shorts and a loose fitting shirt/tank top, since there are places to exercise and play sports on the cruise.
One pair of capris (perfect for when the weather gets a little chilly, or if the dining room does not allow shorts during the evening)
You can't go wrong with black leggings, it's even better if they are the ones that are as long as capris, because they are perfect at night and go with any outfit!
Bring lace tights to wear with a skirt if it's shorter.
Always pack an extra pair of jeans and sweats, because the weather is unpredictable. Plus, you don't exactly want to be wearing your best dress during an excursion involving you climbing rocks and jumping into water.
If you're someone who works out at the gym, or just needs that one day to dress for comfort, then you should consider packing yoga pants.

, Yes girls, this means dresses, and even if you cringe at the slightest mention of the word, there are still other ways to look good at those formal nights on the cruise. Pack at least;


Two dresses (up to 3-4). One should be a classic summer dress, and the other should be a more formal one. The reason being is that some cruises offer teen clubs for girls (and guys) like you to meet up everyday, and they have activities that include a teen dance some nights. Also, there will probably be a formal night where professional photographers are hired to take high quality photos of you and your family/friends.
It's important to have two summer dresses, and you can even buy a romper if you like, since those are pretty stylish as well!
As far as skirts go, you want to look classy on a cruise, so I suggest you do not bring that short mini-skirt with you - it's only going to attract the wrong kind of attention. Instead, bring a nice black pencil skirt that reaches at least mid-thigh, or even a cute bubble or flipped ruffle skirt. You can wear it with a tank top, or a cute dressy top.
It's also nice to pack a jean skirt to wear during the day when it's casual-wear (you can always wear tights or leggings underneath if you do not feel comfortable).
If you can't stand skirts either, then you can always go with a dressy top and dress pants or leggings.

, Chances are that you aren't going to be wearing half of them. And sorry girls, this means absolutely no boots. You'll obviously need:


Flip flops (bring at least two pairs, one with a slight heel)
Two pairs of sandals (be sure to get some really stylish ones with a color that matches with everything)
Running shoes (you'll need these during excursions or if you exercise)
Flats (just in case you have an outfit that doesn't match with sandals)
Two pairs of heels for those formal nights. For heels, they don't have to be huge, even one inch is fine.
You will need a pair of water shoes or crocs if you are going on a more dangerous excursion involving water.

, Hair straighteners are a must, because they don't provide you with them on the cruise. It's also good to keep an extra blow-dryer handy, because the one on the cruise isn't exactly top-notch. If you can't afford (or just don't want to) go to the salon to do your hair for formal nights, then it is recommended that you bring your own curling iron or curling wand. Be sure to bring hair products such as:


Mousse (this gives pretty waves to your hair)
Hair spray
Anti-frizz cream (you'll need a ton of this if you have curly hair, trust me)
Hair serum, and all the other products you use to style your hair.
Blow drying brush
Comb and a pin-cushion hair brush

Be aware that it can get pretty windy on the cruise, so don't spend 3 hours straightening your hair only to have it frizz up with the weather (bring hair ties to pull it back on deck, and tons of hair spray).



, You'll be constantly in the sun, so be sure to bring a stylish pair of glasses that still protects you from the UV rays (there will be a sticker or label indicating this on the glasses). You'll also need:


Belts, since they look great with shorts (and pull them up if you have a tiny waist), and you can always use the thicker ones to accessorize your tops (bring at least three).
Most important accessory: hair ties.(You don't want to straighten/curl your hair every day do you?) You'll need them for a lot, so always keep one or two on your arm since it comes in handy
Necklaces, bracelets (piling on a ton of cute bracelets is in style this summer), anklets, and rings to spice up your outfits. Don't go overboard though!
Little bows and fake flowers (a small white flower is suggested so it doesn't look tacky) can be added, but it can often be perceived as juvenile.
Headbands, clips, a cute tote bag, and earrings of course! And if you're a bit more daring, then even belly rings!

, Although many girls don't like wearing hats, it's always good to pack a visor or a cute straw hat in case the sun is just too much to handle.

, We're all at that age where we feel insecure about our bodies, so don't worry, bikini or one-piece, it doesn't matter! You should pack:


At least one one-piece swim suit (as this will come in handy if you are racing someone in the pool, running laps, or on an excursion that requires constantly swimming in the water)
Since you'll need to alternate swimwear, I suggest having at least two bathing suits, or three if you tend to go in the water a lot.
For bikinis, there are so many styles out there, so pick one that flatters your body type.
Also, if you're someone who's slightly flat-chested and embarrassed, don't worry! There are so many stores that sell swimsuits with a little extra padding or room for inserts in them.
Consider bringing a sarong to tie up on your swimsuit after getting out of the water (or swimsuit cover-up).

, There will always be times on the cruise where you just need time to relax and for yourself.


Bring your iPod or music player with you (remember to bring the charger as well), so you can listen to your favorite tunes while lounging on the pool chairs or while sitting on the Lido deck.
If you're an avid reader, bring your favorite book (or a good one you haven't finished) where you can read on your balcony, stateroom, or somewhere peaceful on the ship.
Always keep 4 to 5 pairs of clean socks in your suitcase.
Keep an extra water bottle or plastic cup handy because you never know when they hand out free drinks.
Just in case, pack a light jacket, and if you tend to get sea-sick, then have some extra pills handy.
Bring ear-plugs if you hate noise, and a sleeping mask with to wear over your eyes at night if you need pitch darkness.
If you want to write about what you did during the cruise, bring a laptop (make sure there's no internet because there are high charge rates) or even just a journal where you can write about your fun experiences.
Don't forget to pack at least three pairs of pajamas, although you probably won't be sleeping much on the cruise! Some comfy shorts or spandex and maybe some sweatpants should do! Or if you want to have the best of both worlds, leggings are the way to go!
Don't forget to bring a camera to document those special memories with your new friends and family members!
Bring at least two pens (I don't recommend a pencil unless it's mechanical)& a notebook (handy for writing things down)
Headphones, extra batteries, lip balm, band-aids (you never know)
Handheld video game (if you're the gamer type of girl)

, If you're someone who can't live without lip gloss, or just wants to dress up for the occasion, then it's important to keep these tools handy in a makeup pouch or carry-on bag. Bring the essentials:


Lip gloss/lipstick
Eyeliner
Mascara
Foundation
Powder, Concealer
Eye shadow, Lip pencil
Blush

Keep the makeup natural during the day (just a little bit of eyeliner, mascara and lip gloss), and you can apply more for the evening. Although you don't need makeup to feel beautiful, it is nice to dress up since it is a cruise, and it's okay to let loose and try something new.



, Yes, your parents already paid a ton of money for you to be on the cruise, but it's nice to keep some cash with you at all times if you want a little extra for yourself. If your cruise has in-store stores, then you can buy cute accessories or outfits, or even desserts like special cupcakes or ice cream sundaes. Or maybe you want to get souvenirs from the ports for your friends, so it's good to pack at least 30 dollars for safe keeping. You never know if something might happen when you're on a port, so having extra cash can help you and your family/friends out big time!

, Okay, for snacks, just pack:


Candy, pretzels or chips for you to snack on at night if you're too lazy to go to the ice cream bar (or if the buffet is closed)
Sometimes there might be candy stores on board too (you'll need to pay with your own money)
Packs of gum to keep your breath fresh throughout the day - bad breath is a turn-off to friends, new acquaintances, family, and basically everyone around you.

, When you see a girl you don't know, just go right up and greet her with something like, ""Hi! I'm__________. I haven't talked to you before. What class are you in? What period do you have lunch?

, Be chatty. Have conversations with people around you. If you can't think of anything to say, admit it. Say something like,""I want to start a conversation with you, but I'm running outta things to say. You don't mind if I blab about the weather for a half hour, do you?""

, Some people actually say bad things about themselves purposely in hope of popularity. However, I suggest you say something positive about yourself. You don't have to brag, just BE POSITIVE! Example: If the teacher asks you to critique your own artwork, say, I think it's not that bad."" If you think it isn't bad.

, Always use your best manners when speaking to others. When you did something wrong, apologize. If it's something big and it's your fault, express the way you feel about it.

Show up at the first teen orientation meeting.,
Keep in mind that cruises do not follow the same social rules as high school.,
Take a closer look.,
Chances are, the group will let you join them.,
Remember, you are now part of the group and you should consider yourself thusly.,
Make sure you show up at planned times agreed on by the group and try to make yourself available.,
If you have become fairly good friends with your cruise group, then on the last day you may want to exchange e-mails or Facebook addresses with one another.",How to Meet Other Teens on a Cruise," If your cruise caters to teens and families, there should be a designated teen hangout where this takes place. Aim to be there a few minutes late to avoid being the only one there, but be sure you have an idea of where the hangout is located. Be confident and not shy, chances are you aren't going to see them again so if you say something stupid WHO CARES? Dress casually and comfortably.;
, You need to make yourself stand out. Take a half second pause by the door without looking too desperate, and if you want to be subtle and avoid looking like a loner, now is a good time to take out your cellphone or iPod and pretend to text or fiddle with it. Casually scope the crowd till you see a group that looks like fun. Avoid choosing the quiet, nervous, and, in all honesty, boring group by the corner because you'll be accepted easily - this defeats the point of a cruise, to have fun! Your ideal group should be:


a mix of guys and girls
talking to each other
a fair amount of people (at least more than three)

, Is there one who seems to be the leader? Generally this would be a cocky guy who is chatting up all of the group and keeping the conversation going. Go over and introduce yourself, making sure you make eye contact with the leader (But do not stare! Do not make yourself look like a freak!) Do a semi-smile that reaches your eyes and speak clearly but confidently and casually ask if you can join them. It is important to look at the entire group but focus on the leader. This will fan his ego (just a little) and give him an instant favourable impression of you. Note: For guys, this should be toned down a bit. Be a bit less shy- guys can pull off a bit more attitude.

, Once you've introduced yourself, sit (Note: Girls, if you are wearing a skirt/dress, be conscious of this!) and ask the names of those sitting closest to you and introduce yourself, smiling and making eye contact. Most likely, at this point the leader will grill you to feel you out a bit. Try to make your answers fairly short, but intelligent. If you have some jet lag and aren't able to pull off something witty at the moment, at least try to sound nice.

, Don't be afraid of getting friendly quickly; you can even get goodnight hugs by the first day. However, your friendliness should be purely platonic with minimal flirting. Do not get too clingy or creepy -- no one likes a stalker. Also, try not to lie (especially if you have a sibling with you!) This has a habit of totally biting you in the rear end later.

, If you are going on many excursions, this may be more difficult, but there are always nighttime activities. Some fun stuff to do (depending on your ship) is to go dancing during teen hours, go tanning, go ice skating and hit the pool.

, You can then tag them in all the awesome pics you took having a blast on the high seas.

, Pack these in a zip lock bag, so that everything will be contained if any bottles or packaging explodes. Pack anything that you use everyday: toothpaste, hairbrush, face wash, etc.

, This includes swim trunks, extra shoes, and any tickets or papers that you might need for later in your trip.

, This can be a suitcase or duffle bag, depending on the amount of things you need to pack.

Any travel documents that you might need. This includes tickets, a passport, a photo id, and travel visas. Check with your parents to see exactly what you should bring.
A music player. Remember to bring headphones and any chargers that you'll need.
A small pillow. This can help tremendously when you are trying to fall asleep in a car, train or airplane.
A book, magazine or homework.
Candy, chips, crackers, or fruit. You don't need that much; about two handfuls of one of the above is fine. Try to pack something that you like: when you're on a long flight or stuck on a train, this might be one of the few treats you can find.

, For example: shorts and T-shirts.(Jumpers, coats and dresses would go in the t-shirt pile, and trousers would go in the shorts pile).

, Place into the bottom of the suitcase and repeat with all the others, being sure to place each pile on one side so you have trousers in one half and t-shirts in another.

, Put the underwear in a separate pocket if there is one and place the pajamas on top.

Walk your dog (or your neighbor's dog if you don't own a dog yourself).


Go rollerblading. It's great exercise and fun.

, Gather some friends and go set up a tent somewhere. A yard, open field (if you're allowed), or a camp site are great places to set up camp.

Buy a kiddy pool. Sure, it's meant for toddlers and children, but it can be great fun with a few of your pals. Slather on the sunblock, pop on your shades, crank up your music and lounge in the pool. It's a fairly cheap way to stay cool in the sun.
Buy, borrow, or rent a Slip N Slide. Remember these? They're yellow things you spread on the lawn and spray with the hose. It's a great way to entertain you and your friends. Fire up the hose and go sliding. Don't forget to take pictures!

, After all, camp is a great place to meet new friends. Plus, there are a lot of different camps out there to choose from.

, You don't have to go anywhere exotic, just visit somewhere in your country, state, or even in your town. Go on a road trip with your family, or go with a few friends to a local place you've never been to before.

, You can grow small plants in flower pots or grow a small vegetable or fruit garden. Look up recipes for preserving your harvest, and prepare to bottle and can things at summer's end.

, Cooking is a fun and delicious activity to try. Take some classes, ask your family members for help, or find a book or search in the internet for easy cooking recipes.

, Music will calm you down and make you feel happy. Make a summer playlist of all of your favorites to listen to while you exercise, go to the beach, or just relax at home. You'll find you end up associating certain songs with your long vacation times, so pick some good ones for good memories.

, Watching movies with friends is a good way to spend time with them.

Make a scrapbook of the summer.,
Make crafts that you'd like to try but haven't yet.",How to Make the Most of Your Summer Vacation (for Teens)4," Buy several disposable cameras in the beginning of summer and carry them around with you. When you go out with your friends, take a few snapshots. Buy some cheap stickers, glue sticks, glitter, etc and have fun.

, Borrow books from the library on how to make them, or use online resources. You don't need to spend a fortune on materials––see what's inside your house, at the local thrift store or in online auctions and save money.

"
"
Go to the mall.",How to Make the Most of Your Summer Vacation (for Teens)5," It's a great way to make new friends too. Hang out around the mall with your friends. Enjoy yourself even if you don't have enough money to buy anything.

, Pretend that you're in a magical world and that you can do anything you want to do there!

, Yoga is a great way to keep calm and be patient. Round up some of your friends and try out a yoga class. You don't have to go to yoga classes; you could also find a book or search in the Internet to practice and try out basic and easy yoga skills.

, You don't even have to wear shoes, so once you get outside, take them off! Being barefoot is perfect for relaxing, especially in the summer.

Wake up at the same time everyday.,
See which friends are available over the summer.,
Keep in touch with everyone!,
Plan some downtime with yourself.,
Start a new hobby, or keep up with your old hobbies.,
Help out around the house, your parents need some help too!,
Consider getting a job, if you're not going anywhere.",How to Manage Your Time over Summer Break," Make sure you get enough hours of sleep; you should sleep in if you stayed up till 2 in the morning playing video games. During the summer, you should aim for at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep. Even if that time is 1 am, try to stay consistent.;
, If none of your close friends are sticking around, either make new ones or call friends of friends that are staying. Ask if they want to go swimming, catch the latest movie, or maybe just hang around your house for your favorite TV show marathon. Check out your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or whatever social networking site that is your favorite but NEVER talk to someone you don't know! Talk to kids from school. Don't talk to random people! Only ""friend"" people on these sites if you have spoken to them before in person or at least have seen around somewhere. If you make plans, be sure to ask your parents for permission.

, Over the school year, you have an excuse not to talk to distant relatives, or friends who live far away. That is when Facebook is again in the situation. But over the summer, you have plenty of time! Send an email to your grandpa; give a call to your friend who moved away. Plan to do something with them. Maybe even ask your aunt if she will go shopping with you for some new clothes!

, Summer time can be a time to have fun, but it is also a great way to relax from the pressures of school. Every day, plan about 30 minutes for you to just chill out. You can go outside and ride your bike, read a book, or just sit in your favorite chair and reflect on your thoughts.

, Search around and find one that interests you. Try joining a club or sport. Many teens get out of shape during the summer, and its important not to just sit around on the computer, video game console, or TV all day. Try to limit your TV/Computer/video game time to a reasonable time span (like 2 hours daily). Many summer camps and classes are also available.. just ask around and look!

, Plan some time to do some chores without being asked, and maybe doing a little extra. Ask your parents if there is anything you can do. It keeps your mind stimulated and provides some exercise. You might be in a dorm room or apartment when you go to college, and keeping clean and tidy is essential. So get in that habit. Just remember that in an average household, these things need to be done daily:


Bedrooms should be clean, with beds made, laundry in a basket, trash in a trash bag. Etc.
Dishes should be done. (Loading and Unloading a dishwasher)
Shower stalls or bathtubs should be sprayed with some soapy water and rinsed off after use.
Scrub down bathroom
Vacuum, dust, sweep house
Garbage disposal should be cleaned (you can do this by running a fresh lemon with baking soda under the tap)
Do laundry
Clean the computer that you are staring at. It might be dirty.
Mow the lawn/Pull weeds/rake leaves, etc.

, Try walking dogs, mowing lawns, washing cars, or baby-sitting. Save up all your money until the week before school starts, then you can buy yourself new clothes, new cell phone, iPod, etc. (Parents LOVE it when you spend your hard-earned cash on something worthwhile).

Afterwards, post it on social media, such as Tumblr or Wattpad. If writing stories isn't your thing, then write a how-to article and post it on wikiHow!;
, Sleepovers aren't just for teenage girls, either! Invite a couple of friends, get loads of junk food, and watch any type of movie you choose. If you have siblings, it may even be a great chance to come up with ideas as to how to prank your brother or sister.

, Give yourself a challenge and see if you can pull it off! Here are some ideas for challenges that could liven up your summer.


Say only ""Yes"" for one day.
See if you can jump on a trampoline for an hour.
Go for a day without using technology.
Avoid complaining for one day.

, Find some music that you like and download it so you can listen to it. You can also create ""summer playlists"" or just a playlist that you can sit back and listen to while lazing around outside.

, You can go to somewhere simple, such as a relative's house, or you can go somewhere like a sleep-away camp - or you can visit summer classics, like beaches or amusement parks. Alternatively, if you have a friend who lives far away from you, arrange to spend some time with them. Come up with plans for you two to do together!


If you want to go to a camp, depending on your age, you may not be able to go as a camper. It may be a good idea to ask about going as a camp counselor - you still get to go, but it's also a lot of extra work, so be prepared for what it entails!

, Many people have hidden talents that they don't discover because they don't want to try! However, it can be a fantastic way to pass your summer by discovering or developing a talent for something. Try out some of the ideas below, and as cliché as it is, don't get disappointed if you don't start off amazing - practice is the key!



Draw.
Play a sport, such as basketball or hockey at a local ice rink.

Write or copyedit.

Tutor someone. You can be a tutor for anything, such as math, Spanish, science (or physics!), or writing.
Try and create inventions without the help of a guide. This will test your knowledge of what you're trying to create.

, While it's not a good idea to spend your entire summer glued to your computer or phone, it can definitely be a good way to pass the time. Try playing games, whether they're simple Flash games or a ""real"" game. You can also browse websites, check on social media, or even just look at random articles on wikiHow!


You can find classic video games online. For example, very old games such as Space Invaders or Pac-Man can be found with a simple Google search.
If you have a 3DS and some money on the Nintendo eShop, you can purchase games from the GameBoy or NES era. For example, you can get Pokémon Red, Blue, or Yellow, or you can purchase the original Legend of Zelda game.
A non-video game example of something to do online is to research your family tree. While it might sound boring, it can actually be very interesting to learn about your past.

, There are plenty of ways to earn money during the summer, especially since many people are going away on trips and may need to have someone take care of things at their homes.


Watch over someone's pets.
Mow lawns.
Wash cars.
Have a garage sale or use a site like eBay to sell things.

Babysit if you have the proper certifications.
If you're able to, consider getting a summer job. Many businesses have summer offerings for teens to take. However, make sure you have all prerequisites that you may need; many states require you to get a work permit from your school. Research your state to see whether you need a work permit. Additionally, many jobs will not take students under 16.

You may also be able to do volunteer work, but this doesn't earn you any money. However, it does give you volunteer experience.



, While you can't really spend the entire summer vacation sleeping, it's a great idea to get some extra sleep while you have the chance. After all, being in school doesn't really allow for a whole lot of sleep!

, Don't get annoyed by this suggestion - classes aren't just for school! You can learn anything through classes, whether they're at a college or online. Many options are available. Pick a subject that you'd like to learn about and find a class on it.


For example, if you're interested in programming, you can find many classes on it, whether the class is online or in person.
You can also learn a language over the summer, whether you studied it in school or not. Spanish and French are commonly taught in high schools, and sometimes even in middle school, but you could also learn German or Italian, or if you want to really challenge yourself, you could try Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, or another language that doesn't use an alphabet that you're used to.

, Have you had the same room for two years now? It might be a good idea to give it a little bit of a change! Clean up your room and get rid of anything you don't want in your room anymore, and then consider making the following changes.


Move around your furniture.
Replace the furniture entirely.
Paint the walls a different color.
Put up new posters or pictures.
Reorganize your storage spaces. If you don't have storage spaces, get some, so that you don't have loose papers and supplies everywhere.

, This type of thing is mostly for people that don't like sleeping. If you love your sleep, you should probably skip this step. If you want to pull an all-nighter, you will need small food (potato chips, sandwich), sugary and addictive drinks like Coke or Sprite (to keep you awake) and a location. You may bring friends along, too! You could watch TV or tell spooky stories to each other, or even quietly play video games. If you plan to watch a movie, watch one that's so and so. Not too funny, not too scary.

, Your friends might be busy, but they might at the least have one free day. You could go shopping, or go to the cinemas, or do something you both enjoy doing.

, When all your friends are free, invite them round to your house. Tell them to bring things they don't want anymore such as clothes, makeup, jewelry, DVD's, CD's, books, bags, etc. Then organize the things you don't want and you can swap.

, Get a tent if you don't have one and find a campsite. Don't forget marshmallows to toast and also take a torch. If you don't have much money to go on holiday, camp in your back garden!

, There's normally lots going on in summer. Ask your friends and family.

, It's a great way to get fresh air and have fun with your family.

,, You could hire one, or buy your own. Invite your friends round, make smoothies and pump up the music!

, Dig a hole (or ask your parents to) and make sure there is mud in it. Pour water into it and take a fun mud bath. Be sure to throw mud at your friends and get totally covered.


If you have a dog, let the dog join in––he'll love it.

, You'll make loads of new friends and also find something that you're interested in.

, You could go and work in McDonald's or go round washing people's cars and you'll earn some money.

, Find a local charity shop, or somewhere where you can get involved with your favorite charity. Ask what you can do to raise money. Maybe you could make things and sell them, or hold an event.

, It could be a summer music program or an art camp. Join a day camp that you would love to try. If you are too old to be at a day camp, or simply don't want to, you could try getting a job at that day camp if you're old enough or at your favorite store or restaurant. You'll make a lot of money!

Makeup: The summer makeup style is light and cute.,
Hair: Summery hair is usually down.,
Outfit: During the summer, lets face it, it gets pretty hot.,
Jewellery: Jewellery is super cute for summer.",How to Look Great During Summer Holidays," It's not at all bold and it enhances your natural features. Start with your normal makeup routine, concealer, foundation etc. When you're finished with that, apply a quick coating of bronzer to give yourself a shiny summery look. Then apply a darkish pink blush along your cheek bones and a tiny bit on your nose. Next move onto eyes. If you haven't already, apply under eye concealer to reduce under eye shadows. Eyeshadow should be something like gold, light pink, silver or light blue. Something subtle, sparkly and summery. Apply only on the eyelid, brown or black eyeliner. Just a small coating and not too thick, and do a very small wing in the corner. Don't do under eye eyeliner. Finish off with mascara and, if you want, fake lashes. Last of all light pink or pale lipstick/lipgloss.;
, A French ponytail works well, getting the hair out of your face, and bows and flowers clipping your hair out of your face is good too. For summer, curling your hair is best. Messy updos also suit lazy summer days. Bright floral bows and headbands are really good for the summer and bright coloured flowers in colours such as pink, blue, yellow and white.

, So dress cool and comfortable, but stylish too. Baggy short sleeve tops, strapless tees and tank tops are great. Stripes, spots and floral patterns are good for the summer. Denim shorts, ruffle skirts and 3 quarter length leggings are good for the summer. If you want to wear a dress, floaty, floral dresses with short sleeves and low necklines are recommended. Sparkly clothes are perfect for the summer because the sun reflects off them. Dungarees are awesome for the summer. Shoes are easy, plimsolls, wedges, sandals, and flip flops/jandals. If you're wearing shorts, gladiator sandals can look great paired with these. If you're wearing a dress or skirt, go with flip flops/jandals or wedges. Dungarees look best with plimsolls.

, Bangle bracelets and charm bracelets are perfect. Pearl necklaces are good. Clip in streaks are a good idea. Bright colours like pink, purple or blue.

Get lots of rest the night before.,
Eat well during the day.,
Stock up on healthy foods for the night.",How to Stay Awake All Night1," It's much easier for the body to run on one night of no sleep than one night of no sleep and one night of bad sleep, so make a plan to sleep as much as you can the night before.


Sleep in the night before. If you wake up close to noon, you'll be less tired when it's time to start really staying up.
Try not only waking up really late but going to bed a bit late the night before. If you go to bed at nine at night the night before, your body will start getting tired around that time.
If you can, take an extended nap a few hours before you plan to stay up. This will give you an extra boost of rest and energy.





;
, If you want to pull an all-nighter, you have to eat three healthy and balanced meals the day before you try to stay up, or your body will feel tired from unhealthy foods or fatigued from undernourishment. Here's what you should eat the day before:


Have a big, healthy breakfast. Eat healthy carbs like oatmeal or wheat-based cereal, proteins like lean turkey or ham, and some fruits and vegetables. Add a yogurt or cottage cheese to your meal.
Have a healthy lunch. Eat a sandwich with wheat bread, a hard-boiled egg, or a big salad with avocado, carrots, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Whatever you eat should give you a boost of energy without making you feel sluggish.
Eat the right dinner for staying up all night. This will be the last meal you eat before you prepare to stay up all night, so make it count. Avoid greasy or fattening foods that will make you feel bloated or heavy. Instead, eat some chicken or turkey, couscous, whole grain pasta, fruits, and vegetables. Make sure you have some carbohydrates for energy, and some proteins like soy, chicken, or ham.
Avoid heavily caffeinated or sugary foods. If you drink coffee all day or eat sugary snacks like candy, then you'll be crashing and ready for bed after dinner.

, Prepare a kit of healthy snacks that you can eat if you get hungry throughout the night, and leave some healthy foods in your fridge if you know you'll be spending the night at home. Here are some foods you can stock up on as you prepare to stay up all night:


Some healthy veggies. Carrot sticks and celery are a great snack that won't make you tired. You can even eat the celery with a bit of peanut butter.
Some healthy fruits. Apples and bananas are easy to carry and will keep you energized.
Some nuts. Almonds, walnuts, and cashews are a delicious and nutritious form of protein.
If you're staying at home, make sure you have some chicken, tofu, or turkey in your fridge, as well as some healthy pasta or couscous that you can cook in a pinch.

, You don’t want to be sitting around all wondering what to do next. Your guy friend might have some ideas of his own, but you can also bring your favorite board game or movie to pop in and watch.


Be open what your friend wants to do as well. For example, if he wants to play video games and you never have, try it out. You may find a new hobby or interest.
Bake snacks for the movie you watch or just to have on hand when you get hungry.

, With a group, there’s less pressure on you and your guy friend. You won’t have to worry about being mistaken for a couple if you’re just friends. A group of friends is also more fun in general because you have more options for games and hijinks.

Avoid drinking too much water or food before bed so that you don’t have to get up in the middle of the night.

, If you need to shave, trim your nails or pluck your eyebrows, do it beforehand so that you don’t waste time at his house., Have a discussion with your boyfriend before you sleep over as far as where you both are in your relationship physically. This will be different for everyone, but don't go through with a sleepover if you haven't set boundaries that you are both comfortable with.


Deciding on boundaries beforehand will help you be prepared to handle any situations that could arise.
Make sure you don't do anything at the boy's house that you would regret later. Be careful so that you don't get yourself in trouble or give yourself a bad reputation.

, If you’re staying over on a school or work night, you want to make sure that you have enough time to get ready for the day. Waking up early also gives you an opportunity to do something sweet like make breakfast or write a cute thank-you note. If you have to leave early, make sure you say goodbye first., In case you need to leave early in the morning or decide you don’t want to stay all night, come up with a plan. If something goes wrong, like he wants to move too quickly and physically than you’re comfortable with or you’re allergic to his pets, have a legitimate excuse. You could say that your parents need you to come home or that you’re not feeling well.


Don’t be afraid to be honest and say that you need to go home.
Honesty is still the best policy., Bring up the subject casually so that they aren’t caught off-guard if this is your first time asking. Checking to see if you can spend a night away from home is better than sneaking off or simply disappearing.


If you’re staying at a guy friend’s house, they may be more lenient. Your only discussion may be that you decide with your parents when you’ll be home and if his parents will be present.
When you want to stay at your boyfriend’s house overnight, your argument will need to be different. You may want to sit down with your parents and possibly your boyfriend and discuss boundaries and rules. Showing this kind of maturity can help your parents agree to a sleepover.
To strengthen your argument, introduce your boyfriend or guy friend and his parents to yours so that they’re not strangers.

, Your parents most likely have your best interest at heart and they could have reasons they don’t want you to go. If they ask questions, answer them clearly and honestly so that they know they can trust you. Explain why you want to go and what you will be doing to reassure them.If they’re worried about your safety, then invite other guy and girl friends to go along with you so that it’s more of a party than one-on-one event.
Discuss with them that you will have a cell phone and charger or at least a list of numbers to call in case of emergency.

, They may not say yes to you the first time you ask to sleep over. However, they may change their minds in the future if you show them that you’re mature and responsible.

One day you can decide to sleep over at whoever’s house you want but try your best to keep a good relationship with your parents., Staying for just one night means you don’t need to pack your entire room into a bag. A few essentials will see you through a whole night of staying over another house. But if you’re staying for a whole weekend, you’ll need a few changes of clothes and more than just a toothbrush., Get a small to medium sized bag for your things.

Think about your daily routine and determine what items you will need for going to bed and waking up., Start with your basic hygiene needs and clean clothes first so that you’re sure they fit in your bag. Then, prioritize your items. You definitely need a toothbrush and toothpaste and they fit easily into a bag.

Change of clothes
Clean underwear
Comfy pajamas
Toothbrush and toothpaste
Deodorant and travel-sized shower products
Hairbrush and bobby pins
Make-up and make-up remover
Cell phone and charger
Extra contacts, your eye glass case, retainer, or specific medicines you might use, Save yourself any embarrassment by thinking ahead and packing tampons and any medications you take for cramps or migraines.

Stimulate your body.,
Stimulate your mind.,
Switch it up.,
Get some light exercise.",How to Stay Awake All Night2," There are a few small tricks that you can do to stimulate your body and keep yourself alert throughout the night. You'll be less likely to fall asleep if parts of your body is active and engaged.

Stretch. Stretching your forearms, calves, and wrists will make your body feel more active and less tight.






Roll your shoulders backward and forward and circle your head from side to side.
Give yourself a quick hand massage.






Tap your foot on the floor.
If you're really falling asleep, pinch yourself or bite down on your tongue.






Gently tug your earlobes.
Chew gum or suck on a mint to keep your mouth active.






If your eyes are getting tired, rest them out a window or gaze in a new location.
Stimulate your senses. Turn up the bright lights and play some medium-loud music to jolt your senses awake.

, Keeping your mind alert is just as important as stimulating your body. To keep your mind alert, you have to switch tasks from time to time and to stay mentally engaged in whatever you're doing. Here's how to stimulate your mind:


Pay attention. Notice everything that's going on around you, and ask questions if you don't understand something, like a section in your textbook that is unclear to you during a study session.
Strike up a conversation. If you're in the middle of a cram session, it's easy to keep talking to the people around you. If you're at home and struggling to stay awake, call up a night owl friend or having a quick conversation with a friend online.
Stay engaged. If you're watching a movie, ask yourself questions about it to make sure that you understand everything that's going on.
Don't let yourself drift off. If you're watching television or having a conversation, make sure that you're focused on the task at hand instead of daydreaming.

, If you want to stay up all night, you have to be able to switch it up from time to time to keep things fresh and to keep your body from falling into a trance. There are a few changes you can make to help yourself stay up all night.

Switch tasks every thirty minutes. If you're watching a movie at a sleepover, take a bathroom or snack break from time to time. If you're cramming for an exam, switch from studying your notes to using flashcards.






Switch up your environment. If you can change your environment, it will be easier for you to stay stimulated. If you're cramming for an exam, move to a different part of the library or your dorm. If you're at a sleepover, just try getting everyone to hang out in a different room from time to time.
Hang out in a different part of the same room. If you're nodding off at your friend's New Year's party, just move from the couch to the kitchen and keep talking to people. If you have to keep sitting down, pick a different seat.

, Though you'll only make yourself more tired if you start an intense workout as soon as you get tired, getting just ten minutes of light exercise can wake up your body and tell your mind, ""Hey, it's not time to fall sleep yet."" Here are a few things you can do:

If you're at a party, take the stairs to the upstairs bathroom instead of using the one that's more conveniently located.
Take a ten-minute walk outside or even inside to wake up your senses.
If you're alone in your room, just do thirty jumping jacks or run in place for two minutes.







"
"
Drink some caffeine in a pinch.,
Eat the right foods.,
Drink lots of water.",How to Stay Awake All Night3," Though caffeine can make you crash and be even more tired than you were to begin with, if you're reaching those late hours of the night and your eyes feel like sandbags, if may be time to have some emergency caffeine.

Start off with a cup of black tea. Its side-effects will be less intense than the effects of coffee.






If you're already a big coffee drinker, have 2 or 3 cups.






If you're really desperate, drink an energy drink like Mother, Monster or Red Bull. Make sure you do not consume a lot of these drinks, preferably 4 cans at the maximum! This will certainly give you a boost of energy for an hour or two, but the crash afterwards can be significant. It's better to have experience with energy drinks before chugging one to pull an all-nighter.







, When you're trying to stay up all night, you should eat just enough to maintain a healthy level of energy, but not so much that you feel bogged down and sluggish. If you've already eaten your three healthy meals, then you shouldn't be too hungry while you're staying up all night, but there are still a few foods that can help you stay awake if you're having a craving.

Eat a hard-boiled egg or quickly make an egg sunny-side up if you're at home.






Eat a handful of almonds, cashews, or pecans.
Eat a crispy apple, celery, or carrot sticks. Just crunching into these foods will wake up your mouth and will make you more alert. Bananas are great for all-nighters because they keep you awake for longer than usual and give you a great source of Vitamin B1 and potassium.
Have a piece of toast with a little bit of peanut butter.
If you're craving a fourth meal, try to have a healthy carbohydrate like brown rice and protein like turkey. If you can't avoid ordering out, try picking foods that aren't too greasy or fatty.

, Staying hydrated can help you stay awake significantly. Drink a glass of ice water to shock your body awake, and drink water frequently to keep your body hydrated and to continue to feel refreshed.


Drinking lots of water will make you have to go to the bathroom often. This can also help keep you from dozing off.

Visit the teen area.,
Party in the teen club!,
Start a dance battle, boys versus girls.,
Hang out with your friends outside the teen program.,
Play games like Ding Dong Ditch and Knock Knock Run.,
Play a classic game of Truth or Dare...or alternatively, you can just play Dare (who cares about the truth part).,
Exchange emails or phone numbers.,
The last day you can have a contest to see who can stay up the longest!,
If you fall asleep you may get pictures drawn on your face!,
Talk to that girl/boy you'll have your eye on as soon as possible.

",How to Have the Most Fun Ever on a Cruise Ship (Teens)," Cruise ships are usually huge, so you'll want to familiarize yourself with the location of places such as the deck and the dining room.;
, Most ships nowadays have a spot where teens hang out and socialize. It's important to find this spot so you can make friends and mix with other teens. Look for a group/individual who looks friendly, and approach them with a casual introduction. A great conversation starter is talking about where you're from, since cruise ship passengers generally come from different places. Go to the teen area as soon as it opens and stay for a pretty sizable portion of time. It may be awkward at first, but later on in the night you will begin to meet the other teens and form your groups of friends. Remember, generally no one knows anyone here, so everyone is feeling how you are. Don't be scared to start talking to people! You only have one week, make the most of it!

, Request catchy club songs like Tik Tok and Just Dance. Make sure that your parents know where you are, so your they won't bother you for the night as you interact with other teens.

, Dance battles are classic forms of entertainment and most people enjoy them. Show off so that your side can win and make sure you have someone on your team who can cover stunts like flips. You can battle to a really old song like Can't Touch This!

, It is much more fun, and you will have the chance to talk to/flirt with that guy/girl you've had your eye on. Be confident and GO FOR IT!

, Go to a floor with bedrooms on it with all of your friends. Have 2 or 3 people hold the elevator doors open. The rest of the people all go kick or knock on someone's door. After you knock on the door, run for your life, because the person who was just asleep is wide awake now and is about to open up their door! The object of the game is not to get caught by the person in their room.

, A really good dare is to make one of your friends go up to an adult and make them dance with them like they are in the club. Remember not to get carried away with your dares, though. Stay safe!

, If you exchange, there's a chance they will text, email, video chat, or call you after the cruise! If they don't have one, sadly, the only thing you can do is make the best out of it. The only other way to see them would be by sheer coincidence or if you and your friend's parents became friends.

, Drink one energy drink like Monster or Full Throttle, and play the aforementioned Ding Dong Ditch.

, That's the punishment unless you want to look stupid. If you feel your eyes getting heavy splash your face with freezing cold water; it works.

, Seriously. Pajamas and lounge clothes will only put you in the mood to slack. A pair of jeans and a shirt you would usually wear during the day will put you in character, in a sense.

, A celery stick and a carrot can help release a sustained level of energy and keep you focused. If you don't enjoy either of those, find something else, as long as it is whole food based, or you'll just screw yourself over energy wise.

, Studying is dehydrating!

, Be sure it is the right music before you either end up sleeping or partying!

, Your study space has to be CLEAN and ORGANIZED. Get rid of the stuff you don't need. Shove it in a box in the corner if you have to, just make sure you have your basic tools to work with.


Now that your space is clean, revel in it for a moment and think how nice it's going to be to enjoy clutter free study time!

, In my psychology course we basically learned that quick revision like this after short term learning is a lot more likely to get the info in your head. The small chunk of information to revise every 15 mins isn't intimidating like trying to remember what you have been reading for the past hour.

, This will definitely keep stress at bay by preventing that awful feeling of being overwhelmed.

, How rewarding! Legitimate procrastination! Score! But get back to work!

, Congratulate yourself on what you're doing. This all-nighter is a good thing. What you're doing is a good thing. Remember that. It will keep you motivated. Positive self talk is helpful regardless of how much you believe you may be lying to yourself. You want to get this night over and done with, don't you?

,,, Think along with what you're doing. Not behind, or ahead, ALONG with. This actually stops you worrying!

, Also, a ""Just do it!"" attitude throughout the night and exam is vital.

, Remain levelheaded, breathe, and give yourself time to collect yourself at the end of every study chunk.

, The next morning, a caffeinated beverage is clearly going to be in order, regardless of what health experts say. Just keep to the level you know is good for you!

Use a tablet or computer.,
Watch tv or a movie.,
Play video games.,
Listen to loud music.,
Set an alarm clock.",How to Pull an All Nighter or Stay up Late (for Preteens)1," Borrow a mobile phone from your parents or older family members if you do not have your own. They are great for keeping you entertained with games, apps, music, and videos. Make sure you have the permission of the person you are borrowing the phone from before downloading anything.


If you need to connect to the internet to play a game, watch a video, or listen to music, make sure that you are wearing headphones or have turned down the volume;
, Ask your parents or older family members for permission before using a tablet or computer. You may already have games or apps that you enjoy, but you may also get help from your parents or older family members to help you find more that can help you pass the time.


While some apps are free others require a payment. Don’t purchase anything without permission from your parents or older family members.
If you have the permission to download something, you may need to know what type of computer or tablet you have. Some apps may only work with a certain type of tablet, like an iPad for example. Read the description of your game or app to be sure it works with your computer or tablet. Ask an adult for help if you are still unsure.
Use earphones so that you can make the volume as loud as you want without waking up the rest of the house.

, Whether you watch a movie on a tablet or binge watch an entire tv series, choose something you enjoy. Watch a funny movie or a scary movie to keep your mind engaged. If you watch a movie that you’ve seen many times or a very slow movie, you may fall asleep.


Plan ahead of time and ask your parents or older family members to help you download movies or tv shows for your tablet, phone, or computer. You may also ask them for help to PVR some tv shows if your tv is able to record them.
Use headphones to make sure that you do not wake up anyone else in the house.

, Whether you have a gaming console or are able to borrow one, video games can keep you occupied all night. If you are having trouble passing a level then switch to another game. The more you get frustrated, the more likely you are to get tired and go to sleep.


Borrow games from friends or family to make sure you are entertained throughout the night. You may have already completed all the games in your collection and a new challenge can help your mind stay alert.

, Make sure to use headphones when trying to stay awake with music. You do not want to keep the rest of your house awake. Listen to music with a faster beat as slow and quiet music may make you tired.


Create a playlist of your favourite songs that you know will get you energized the days leading up to your all-nighter. You may want to find music that will get you up and dancing.
Use an mp3 player, mobile phone, or tablet that’s portable so that you can move around while you listen to your music.

, Use an alarm clock as a safety net when you try to stay up all night. If you feel yourself drifting, set the alarm for 30 minutes or one-hour intervals so you can jolt yourself awake. If you don’t have an alarm clock, ask to borrow one from your family or friends.


A digital alarm clock may be set by going into the settings menu for personal preferences on volume, the type of alarm, and how long your alarm will ring.
Alarms work because they trigger your body’s natural stress response. Some alarms come with a snooze button that stops the alarm from ringing but restarts in a few minutes. While you immediately become alert once you hear an alarm, if you press the snooze button too much you will get your body to ignore its natural response which will leave you feeling groggy.Test your alarm clock. Make sure that the batteries are good or plug it in if it doesn’t run on batteries. If you are borrowing it, ask the person you are borrowing it from how to set it and to test it with you to make sure it works properly.

Ask them if they have any suggestions for movies in that genre. When you've received everyone's responses, tally them together to see if there are similar or duplicate requests, then make a decision on the movie.

When picking a movie, make sure that the younger members of your family will understand it and not get confused. All movies chosen should be age appropriate for the children watching it.;
, There will need to be enough room for your entire family to sit comfortably. If necessary, you can bring in some beanbag chairs, lie down a comfortable blanket or just sit on the floor. A living room is the best place for this, but you can enjoy the movie in a bedroom, games room or other room that has a TV, as well.

, Part of the fun of movie night is staying warm and cozy. If it's a warm night though, just provide cushions and pillows for leaning on.

, If you are having the movie after dinner, have dessert during the movie. If it's later, have some snacks, such as popcorn, candies, fresh fruit slices, or home baked cookies. Try to keep it healthy and in small portions; it's only a snack after all.

Caffeine can be extremely addictive so make sure you only consume a little bit if you are allowed.

, Ask a friend or family member to give you a wake-up-call or, better yet, stay up with you. Having someone else there to push you through your fatigue will make the night go by faster. You can play board games, cards, watch movies, or simply have a conversation. Keep each other accountable.

Plus, different people may play it a little differently, so say exactly how you want to play it at your house. That way, everyone is clear.Also, you can add your own rules if you need to do so, such as ""No dares that make you go outside,"" or ""No dares that make a person eat something."" Also, a ""nothing dangerous"" rule is a good one.
If you prefer, you can print out rules ahead of time, so that you can point to them if someone tries to break a rule.

, While some play the game where each person gets to come up with truth questions and dares, you can also print questions ahead of time. Use an online resource, or come up with your own questions.Once you print out the questions, cut them into little strips, and fold them. Add them to a bowl, and have people draw questions out. Have a different bowl for dares.
Sometimes, truth or dare can turn mean when someone starts targeting one person with super embarrassing questions, trying to embarrass him or her more than anyone else. If you use this method, you can cut down on the possibility of it turning mean, since everyone draws from the same questions.
You can also use a smartphone app to come up with questions.

, How you pick is up to you. You could pick the oldest, the tallest, or the person who's birthday is nearest, for instance. Another alternative is for the host to go first.


You could also do the finger on nose trick. People need to be in on this bit for it to work, though. Basically, one person puts their finger on their nose without saying anything. When someone else sees a person with a finger on their nose, they follow suit. The last person to catch on goes first., In truth or dare, you can just let the asker choose who they're going to ask. However, it can be more fair to go in circle or a specified pattern, is that everyone gets an equal number of turns.

, To start the game, the person who's going first asks another person ""Truth or Dare?"" Then, the person being asked gets to choose which one they want to do., Once the person being asked chooses, the person who's asking must come up with a truth or dare for the person to do.If you printed out questions ahead of time, then the person being asked can draw one out to do. Have someone read the question out loud.


As the host, you may need to enforce the rules here. For instance, if a dare seems to dangerous, you may need to nix it. That can be hard if you're standing up to friends, but you could use a parent as an excuse, such as ""If my mom found out someone did that, you'd all have to go home. Let's pick something else.""
Some appropriate dares might be ""Walk like a model,"" ""Do 5 cartwheels in a row,"" ""Pour a cup of ice-cold water on yourself (in the shower with your clothes on),"" or ""Dance silly for 1 minute.""Some appropriate questions might be ""What's the worst present you've ever gotten from your parents?"" ""What famous person would you switch places with?"" ""What's the grossest or most bizarre thing you've eaten?"" or ""What's the most embarrassed you've ever been?"", Once a question has been asked or a dare established, it's the job of the person being asked to complete it.If you allowed it in the rules, sometimes the person can switch to the other category if they don't like the question they were asked or the dare they were given.


In theory, the person has to do one or another, but of course, sometimes people refuse. You could have a one-time do over for each person. That is, if they don't like either option, they can say, ""do over,"" and get a different question or dare., Once the person has completed the question or dare, it's that person's turn to ask someone else. If you're moving in a circle, it will be the person next to them., Keep going until everyone has had an equal number of turns. There's no limit to how long you can play truth or dare, as long as people keep coming up with questions.Alternatively, you could play until your bowls run out of questions or dares. That way, everyone can see when the game is going to end.

, You may find you or someone else is embarrassed by a question or answer they have to give. If you're embarrassed, try playing it off by using humor to downplay the embarrassment. Everyone will laugh and hopefully move on from the awkward situation.For instance, if you answered ""I drank breast milk from a bottle when I was six"" to the question ""What's the weirdest thing you've ever ate?"" your friends may giggle. If they find it odd, you could say, ""Well, I had to make sure it wasn't going to poison my baby brother. My mom ate anchovies the night before!"" Hopefully, your friends will laugh, and you can move on.
You can also use the same technique if someone else gets embarrassed. However, don't make it at their expense. Rather, try to deflect the embarrassment by changing the subject or even pulling the embarrassment on yourself.

, If you find one person is being intentionally mean to another, you may need to confront that person. That is, say one of your friends keeps asking really mean questions to another person she doesn't like that much or giving her really embarrassing dares. Try confronting the person.One way you could confront her is to take her aside and say something about it. Ask her to help you get snacks from the kitchen, and say, ""I know you're being mean to Alisha on purpose. Would you stop, please? I want people to have fun, not end up in tears. Can you just call a truce for tonight?""
You can also playfully call her out in front of the group, but be aware you may hurt her feelings. You could try something like, ""Hey, Jess, that was kind of a mean question. Maybe Alisha doesn't want to talk about that.""

, If necessary, you may need to call an end to the game. If it's devolving into drama and tears, that's no fun for anyone. If you notice that happening, try suggesting something else to do instead, such as watching a movie or baking a cake together. Pick something light-hearted and fun that you can all do together, working with each other rather than against each other. Doing something that will make you giggly is always a safe bet.


Look for signs people are getting embarrassed. If someone gets up suddenly and leaves the room after a question, she's likely embarrassed.
Also, if anyone is close to tears, that's definitely a good time to end the game.

Move quickly.,
Act innocent in the morning.",How to Play a Sleepover Prank," Everyone should agree that it will be prank night before the sleepover begins. Try and set some ground rules. For example, the first one to fall asleep gets pranked. Or maybe it's fair game and anyone can be pranked at any time.


Consider setting rules for situations where the person being pranked wakes up or catches the prankster. For example, if a prankster is caught then they have to do their victim's bidding for the entire night.
Try getting creative by limiting the items that can be used for pranking. One night only allow shaving cream, Jell-O, and a whoopee cushion for pranking. Change it up for every night prank-themed sleepover.
Establish a prize for the person who successfully pranks the most people. For example, the person with the least amount of pranks or the one who was pranked the most has to buy lunch for the top prankster.;
, Some people may have a particular aversion to certain pranks. Some people might not want their belongings frozen while others might not want any pranks to happen in the bathroom. It's vitally important to make sure what everyone is comfortable with so none of the pranks potentially offend anyone.

, Some people make mean-spirited pranks with the intention of hurting someone or getting revenge. If you see anyone prank a friend in a physically or emotionally damaging way, call them out and let them know that it's not acceptable. Pranks should occur in an inclusive atmosphere, not a hostile one.

, This one is great if everyone wants to have fun without pranking anyone at the party. Consider picking up a phone book to find an unsuspecting victim if a friend isn't answering. When they pick up the phone, pose as a refrigerator repairman. Ask if their refrigerator is running. When they say 'yes,' respond with, 'well you better go catch it!' Make sure to hit *67 before calling so the number can't be traced.

, For example, watch a couple of movies or listen to relaxing music. If it's near 11:30 P.M. and there still aren't sleepers, find a friend who doesn't fall asleep easily and tell them to help you plan something boring and relaxing. Have everyone lie down on the floor or on the bed. Then start going around the circle telling secrets. If you reach someone who doesn't respond lean over carefully to check if they nodded off. If they have, it's go time. Otherwise, rinse and repeat until you have a sleeper.

, This prank is easy to pull and is perfect for some harmless fun. The best part is that you get to be a little creative with it. Just be sure not to get the shaving cream near the eyes as it can cause irritation.


Take someone's shaving foam from the bathroom. It will likely be near the razors and other shaving supplies.
Squirt some on their hair and give them a mustache, goatee, or whatever crazy hairstyle you can think of.
In the morning, they'll wake up and will be completely surprised.

, Get some washable markers or red lipstick. Make sure the markers and lipstick are both non-toxic and easy to clean off. Be especially careful with the lipstick as its owner may get upset when they realize it has been used for a prank. When your friend is fast asleep, write 'Gotcha' or some other phrase across their forehead.

, When your friend is sleeping, carefully spread some peanut butter on both of their hands. Next, tickle their nose with a feather or other small object until they wake. Typically they will be startled and their reaction will be to immediately swat at their face, covering it with peanut butter. , This prank is perfect for those who love pranking with a little preparation. Make sure your friend is asleep or away from their bag so they won't notice their missing bra.


Take your friend's bra out of their bag.
Soak it in warm water.
Put it in the freezer.
Once it's frozen, break it in half by breaking the ice in between the cups of the bra.
Then put in their bag so when they put it on in the morning they're going to get a chill!

, This prank was famously seen on the television show The Office when a character suspended a stapler in a bowl of jello. Be sure to allow a couple hours for this prank as the Jell-O requires some time to make.


Find the object you want to suspend in the jello. Try a small piece of clothing, a wallet, or someone's student ID card.
Make the Jell-O according to the package instructions, but fill the container to the halfway point.
Put the Jell-O in the refrigerator and let it sit for two hours.
Take the Jell-O out and put the desired object on top of the first layer.
Prepare another packet of Jell-O and pour it on top of the first object.
Put the bowl back into the refrigerator and let it set for another two hours.
Finally, you will have your friend's precious object firmly cased in Jell-O.

, For example, sneak in a fake rat, snake, or bat into the sleepover. Think of strategic places to hide your fake animals. A fake rat would be perfect to hide in someone's bag or under a pillow. Snakes are great for hiding in the toilet or peeking from beneath a shower. Bats should be hung strategically above sleeping friends or in spooky closets. , Many phones have apps that allow you to change your voice, which can come in handy for spooking someone. Wait until your friend is asleep or preoccupied and position yourself behind them at an angle where they can't see you. Load up the scariest sound on your voice-changer app, something like a Darth Vader tone usually works, and say menacing things into their ear when they least expect it. , Anyone can pull off this scare but it takes skill to perfect the timing. Find a strategic location to hide behind such as a door or a wall where you can't be seen. Wait until your target walks by. Consider recruiting a friend to lead the target near your hiding place. Jump out and make a loud yelling noise right when they're close to you and watch as they yelp from the surprise.

, Loud shoes and heavy footsteps can easily wake up your unsuspecting victims. When sneaking up on friends or navigating around sleepers, be sure to take your shoes off and tip-toe carefully around the victims. Socks or bare feet are preferred. Make sure you maintain your balance while tip-toeing to avoid falling over and making commotion.

, Don't take more time than absolutely necessary as it will prolong your chances of getting caught. Plan out your prank beforehand and time out the steps necessary to get a feel on how long it should take. Set a silent timer and stick to that time as much as possible so you don't risk ruining the prank.

, Everyone will be trying to figure out who the prankster is so feign disbelief when you are accused. Keep a calm, cool face even when you want to burst out laughing or proudly proclaim your victory.

Plan a road trip.,
Visit friends.,
Consider a warm vacation.",How to Have Fun During Winter Break1," If you're able to drive and have access to a vehicle, a road trip can be a wonderful bonding experience between you and your friends. Pack a bag, load up the car, and hit the road together to explore someplace new and exciting.If you are not yet old enough to drive, ask your parents about the possibility of taking a road trip together. Road trips take some planning (and money), though, so be sure to give your parents a few weeks to make arrangements.
Decide in advance where you want to go. Driving aimlessly can be fun, but you can quickly find yourself lost, out of gas, or out of money.
Choose whether to stay in hotels or camp. If you do camp, make sure it's feasible to camp in the conditions you'll be entering and plan for the weather wherever you'll be staying (which may mean preparing for snowy winter camping, depending on where you'll be).
Make accommodation arrangements. If you'll be staying in hotels/motels, look into where you want to stay and consider booking a reservation. If you'll be camping, scout campgrounds and see if they accept reservations over the phone or online.Choose a scenic route to get to your destination, if it's possible to do so safely.
Know the conditions you'll be facing. Remember that some areas require chains on your tires to drive through icy mountain passes, which may be too dangerous for you to travel.
Get your car checked out before the trip to make sure it's in good working condition.
Bring whatever supplies you'll need. That includes emergency supplies in case you get stranded: extra blankets, food, water, batteries, a flashlight, road flares, gas money, and an extra charger for your cellphone.;
, Winter break is a great time to reconnect with friends you haven't seen in a while. Whether you've been off at college or simply burdened by your studies in your home town, it can be difficult to spend time with friends while you're in school at any level.


Reach out to friends you don't see very often.
Ride bikes together, play in the snow, or simply hang out watching movies or playing video games.
Consider taking a trip to visit friends who live a few towns away or a state over. If you're not old enough to drive, ask your parents (and your friends' parents) about the possibility of taking an overnight trip.
Have a sleep over with friends you've missed.
Catch up on what's new with your friends.
Get coffee together or go out for a meal.

, Depending on your financial situation, you and your family/friends may want to take a trip together to a warmer location. You can even take a trip alone, if you have sufficient funding and feel comfortable traveling solo. Spending a few days or a week on a warm, sunny beach might be just what you need to unwind from school and chase away the winter blues.


Start saving early and budget your money. Decide whether you'll need a hotel/motel, a rental car, and tickets to a theme park or other destination, and work those costs into your budget.
If you're still young, ask your parents about whether a fun vacation might be possible. This type of trip can take months to plan, though, so be sure you ask well in advance of your winter break.
Avoid traveling on major holiday weekends, as prices for flights tend to surge during these busy periods.
You'll certainly be able to find lodging at a nationally-renown beach, but you can save a lot of money if you plan to stay at a smaller beach community off the beaten path. Just make sure that the area has what you need, including transportation and recreation options.Find the best flight and/or hotel deals by searching a site like Expedia or BookingBuddy. These websites deliver prices from numerous travel pages to help you find the best prices, even on the same flight.Plan on bringing one outfit per day, or scale down your suitcase by re-wearing some items. Just be sure you bring clothing that will be comfortable and appropriate for your destination."

Choose a room.,
If your parents ask you to use your actual bedroom (assuming it's too small/near their bedroom), explain why it would be helpful, if you could use a bigger room in a different part of the house where they aren't.",How to Prepare Your Room for a Sleepover1," It should be relatively big and away from your parents room. Your parents will most likely want to sleep. If your room only has one or two beds, lay down some airbeds or mattresses for your guests.;
, Chances are, they'll appreciate you thinking of them and their sleep when asking to use a room where your late night chatting won't disturb them. No one likes to be disturbed or have a cranky parent drop in and yell at you to go to sleep.

Have fun!

",How to Plan a Sleepover at the Last Minute," Ask your friends if they have anything planned for Saturday afternoon (or Friday night, or a day in the holidays, or whenever your sleepover is). If they do, consider adjusting your sleepover time to suit them - after all, there's no point hosting a sleepover with no guests! About four o'clock is a good time, since then your guests can come for tea.;
, Food is incredibly important. Junk food works best, so make sure you have a good selection. You don't have time to go round specialist shops, so head down to your nearest supermarket to stock up. Take-outs work too!

, They are the thing that will make your sleepover work! Have crisps, strawberries, chocolate, marshmallows, etc., in the room your sleepover is being hosted in, and make sure all guests get some.

, You may not have time to plan a list of amazing jolly-hockey-sticks adventures, so go for the classics - Would You Rather, Truth or Dare, Paranoia...the type that don't need much planning, but always go down well.

, Get some facial recipes and makeup, and dress each other up.

,, If you don't have a big room, clear huge furniture into another room for the night (or at least push it back) so there will be enough room for your guests to sleep.

Dress warm and know the signs of hypothermia.,
Play in the snow.,
Visit your local ice rink.,
Go sledding or snow tubing.,
Enjoy cross-country skiing or snowshoeing.,
Try downhill skiing or snowboarding.,
Visit your local park.,
Go running.,
Bike around your neighborhood.",How to Have Fun During Winter Break2," Winter is a great time to get outdoors and have fun. Whether you're interested in physical activities like skiing or simply playing in the snow in your yard, it's important to dress warm - but not so warm that you can't stop sweating - and protect your body against heat loss. You lose the most heat from your head, hands, and feet, so make sure you cover these extremities as well as your core (chest and abdomen). If you or others experience any of the following symptoms of hypothermia, get indoors immediately and call emergency services to find out how to proceed:


involuntary shivering
inability to perform motor functions
confusion
loss of coordination
slurred speech
irrational behavior, Depending on your age, it may have been many years since you've played in the snow when you were a child. But spending time building things in the snow or having outdoor adventures with friends/family can be fun at any age. Just make sure you dress appropriately, and make a mug of steamy hot chocolate to warm up when you return indoors.Have a snowball fight with friends.
Build a snowman.
Make snow angels.
Build a snow fort., Ice skating is another great way to spend time with your family and reconnect with a fun childhood activity. You can skate at indoor rinks or outdoor rinks, if they're available in your community, and admission is usually very cheap (and sometimes free).Find ice rinks near you by searching online.
If you have your own skates that still fit, bring them. If not, call ahead to make sure the rink has rental skates available.

, If you grew up in an area with snowy winters, you probably went sledding at some point as a kid. Sledding is still a fun activity, even for adolescents and adults. You can sled at your old neighborhood hill, or check online to see if any ski hills offer snow tubing. Tubing is like sledding, only you're towed up a hill and get to ride to the bottom on an inflatable tube, often over jumps and ridges., If you live near a park or rural area, you may want to try your hand at cross-country skiing or snowshoeing. These activities are not as fast-paced as downhill sports, but they offer solitude (or companionship) through a quiet, peaceful winter wonderland.Call your local sporting goods stores to see if you can rent cross-country skis or snowshoes.
If you don't have any luck at a sporting goods store, you might try a nearby ski resort. Many ski resorts offer cross-country ski rentals in addition to their downhill equipment, and some may even have well-groomed cross-country trails at the resort.

, Downhill skiing and snowboarding are tremendously fun sports, but they can also be incredibly dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. It's important that you take lessons and start out slowly so you don't injure yourself or put others at risk.Start out slow. If you've never skied before, stick to the ""bunny hills"" that are meant for beginners.
Most ski hills are rated with a colored shape to indicate difficulty. Those ratings are consistent throughout each resort, meaning that each hill of the same rating will be about the same level of difficulty.Remember that ratings are only consistent within that resort. An easy hill at a resort in Colorado would probably be ranked as an intermediate or difficult hill in Vermont, for example.
A green circle means the hill is easy, and generally suitable for beginners (though you should check with a ski attendant if it's your first time).
A blue square means the hill is slightly more difficult, and may be best for skiers with intermediate experience.
A black diamond means that a hill is one of the most difficult ski trails. Black diamond trails should only be attempted by highly-skilled skiers with many years of experience.
Double-black diamond means that the hill is the most difficult and requires extra caution than even a regular black diamond hill. Never attempt a black diamond or double-black diamond if you aren't a very talented, highly-experienced skier.
Orange oval means that the hill is a freestyle terrain. These hills typically require a lot of experience and proficiency, and should only be attempted by professionals.

, If you live in a warm weather climate, you may be able to play outdoors year-round. Even if you live in a colder climate, however, many cities plan fun outdoor activities in the winter - just be sure to dress warm enough for whatever activities you have planned. Check online to see what outdoor events your town or city hosts each winter. Local events at your park may include:


hot chocolate
ice skating
holiday light shows
tree decorating ceremonies

, If you live in a warmer climate, you may be able to go running outdoors during winter break. Make sure you pace yourself if you're new to running, and don't try to push yourself too hard or too fast.


Find jogging trails near your home, or simply go for runs around your neighborhood (if it's safe to do so).
Dress appropriately. If you get too bundled up, you'll sweat profusely and end up cold; if you dress too lightly, you may be freezing, and could get sick as a result.

, If you live in a warm climate and are able to ride your bike safely in your area, you may want to explore your community by bike. Bicycling is a great way to get fresh air and exercise while exploring new, off-the-path places right in your neighborhood. However, biking can also be dangerous, especially if you live in a high-traffic area. For this reason, it's important to take every precaution to ensure your safety.


Always wear a properly-fitted bicycle helmet, no matter how old you are or how far you'll be riding.
Check your tires and brakes before riding. Make sure your tires are properly inflated, and tap your brakes in the driveway before leaving your home to ensure that they'll work when you need them.
Children under 10 years of age are typically supposed to ride on the sidewalk, while adolescents and adults are usually expected to ride in the street. However, if you feel unsafe riding in the street, it's best to choose the sidewalk to prevent an accident.
Check the laws in your town or county online, as some municipalities prohibit riding bicycles on the sidewalk. Breaking these laws may result in a fine if a police officer stops you.
Wear bright colors so that other motorists can see you, and try to avoid riding at night. If you must ride at night, take extra precautions and wear reflectors and bicycle lights.
Keep at least one hand on the handlebars at all times, but try to keep both hands engaged by carrying groceries or other items in a backpack.
Ride in the same direction as traffic is moving, and follow all traffic signs/signals. Be alert and use signals to indicate to others when you'll be turning or braking."

Rest up.",How to Have Fun During Winter Break3," Winter break is often the one time of year that entire families are back together again. Whether your family is kept apart by school locations, work obligations, or other factors, winter break may be the only time you get to see everyone at once. Don't take it for granted; spend time with one another, and do fun activities together.


You can participate in any number of indoor or outdoor activities together.
Ask your parents and siblings what they'd like to do while you're home, and offer your input on fun things you'd like to do.
You can play board games or card games indoors, or go out and explore your hometown.

, You may associate museums with school field trips, but museums can be great fun to visit when you're not there for class. Museums are a great place to learn about history and the natural world, soak in some of the most famous art in the world, or simply people watch from a quiet bench in the galleries.


Check online to find out the hours and location for your local aquarium, history museum, or art museum.
Remember to be respectful at any museum. There may be restrictions on what you can bring in, whether or not you can take photographs, and what levels of volume are acceptable.

, A lot of new movies tend to be released around winter break, which means you'll be home during a peak movie season. Spend time with your family or friends and see the newest comedy, action film, or drama that's being hyped up this year. You can even go out for coffee after the movie and talk about what you liked or didn't like about it together.

, After a stressful semester of reading and studying, books might be the last thing on your mind. But reading for pleasure is a wonderful hobby that can immerse you in a world of experience. You can read alone in your room, or invite your family to join you by the fireplace with their own books and spend some reading time together.


Reread an old favorite from your bookshelf at home, or pick up a new book that sparks your interest.
If you're really feeling adventurous, try reading in a genre that you don't normally pursue and see what you can learn and enjoy from it.
Visit your local library, or go to your community bookstore. You can also order books online and have them shipped to your home the next day.
If you know your syllabus or reading assignments for the spring, you can even get a head start on the books you'll be reading when school resumes. It may be an assignment, but you can still work at your leisure and enjoy the book recreationally, too.

, Time off from school is a great time to start a new project or learn something new. You may be reluctant to do any learning over winter break, but a new creative pursuit is something that can help relieve stress, and if you enjoy it you can make it a life-long hobby.Try puzzles, drawing, painting, writing, knitting, crocheting, scrapbooking, or learning an instrument.
Creative pursuits give you an instant sense of reward because you have a final product that you made.

, Cleaning may not be the most fun thing to do when you're home on break, but it's a great way to spend time with your parents. Plus, they'll certainly appreciate your efforts to help keep the house tidy while you're home.

, Watching television is a great way to unwind, and you can do it alone or with family and friends. Binge watch your favorite shows together, introduce your parents to your new favorite sitcom, or let them show you their favorite TV shows.


Try not to spend more than four hours watching television on a given day. You may be on winter break, but too much television can be bad for you (especially if you're still growing and developing)., If you used to play video games, you probably still have your game system at home. If you're new to video games, try them out at a friend's house, or rent a game console and a few games from a video game store in your area.


Search online to find out where to rent or buy video games and gaming consoles.
You may also be able to download games online and play them on your computer.
You can play video games alone, or with friends/family.

, Your winter break will probably involve a lot of running around to spend time with relatives and catch up with friends. You might also travel or spend time outdoors. No matter what you do, though, it's important to get caught up on your sleep and make sure you get enough rest while you're home.


Most adolescents need about 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night.If you've been staying up late studying for final exams before winter break, you may be far behind on your sleep.
Set aside enough time each night to get adequate sleep, especially while you're home from school and away from distractions.

Set up a meeting with your teacher.,
Explain your frustration without blaming the teacher.,
Ask exactly what you have done wrong.,
Listen to what the teacher is saying.,
Smile and nod.",How to Deal with a Teacher Picking on You1," After class, ask your teacher if you can meet with them after school. If they are unavailable that afternoon, plan to meet them at a time when you can both talk. Meeting them in their office before or after school is ideal.


You can ask, ""Is there a good time when we can meet to discuss my work in this class? I want to go over some comments that you have given me."" Offer some times when you are available to meet. You do not have to discuss specifics with them yet.
If you are nervous about approaching your teacher, try to take a deep breath before you go over. Remember that meeting with students is part of the teacher's job.;
, When you do meet, you should start off by saying exactly where you are struggling in their class. You may feel as though the teacher is unfairly picking on you for a particular essay, or you may think that they ask you too many questions in class. Regardless, try to avoid blaming them for the behavior. This may make them defensive.Instead, say you are frustrated with the class, and you feel as though you cannot meet their expectations.


Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. For example, say “I feel as though I can’t understand the questions you are asking me” instead of “You keep making me answer hard questions in class.”Sometimes teachers tease as a way of bonding with students, but don't realize that some students consider it embarrassing or even critical. Try saying, ""I feel really embarrassed when you mention my work/writing in front of the class. I don't like all the attention on me.""
Try to be calm and rational. You can say, “I keep getting C’s on my papers, which is frustrating because I work very hard on them. I usually think I'm doing well, but then I always get points taken off.”

, While you may not feel as though you have done anything wrong, there is a chance that you are missing a key piece of information or instructions in your coursework. Asking your teacher will show that you are willing to put in the effort to improve. You can ask:


”How can I better prepare for your class?”
“How can I improve my essays?”
“What am I missing when I turn in my assignments?”

, Most likely, your teacher has given you criticism that will help you improve. Carefully consider the type of comments you receive in your meeting. This can tell you if the teacher is giving you valid criticism or if they are bullying you.


Is this criticism justified? Have you actually made the mistake that the teacher is coaching you about? If the answer is yes, then no matter how much you are annoyed by the teacher pointing out your mistakes, you should accept the criticism and fix these specific problem areas.
Your teacher should never call you names or insult you. If your teacher is telling you that you are stupid, dumb, or annoying, you can complain to the administration.

, If you are irritated, this is probably the last thing that you feel like doing, but your teacher will not respond well to arguing, yelling, screaming, or insults. Just be polite, smile, and agree. This will get the teacher off of your back, and it will make life easier for you.


Instead of arguing, ask what you can do to fix the problem. For example, if the teacher says you do not have enough sources on your bibliography, you may disagree. Instead of challenging them, say “I have ten sources. How many more do I need?”
Avoid threatening your teacher. Even if you are not serious about the threat, schools will have to take it seriously, and you will be punished.Avoid phrases like ""yYou'll regret this,"" or, ""I'll show you.""

Try a scary prank.,
Try sleep-related pranks.,
Don’t do something permanent.,
Avoid pranks that will get someone in trouble.,
Don’t be mean spirited.,
Prank yourself sometimes.",How to Prank at a Sleepover," The first person to fall asleep is an easy target for pranks because there will still be many people awake to enjoy the fun together. Or, if you prefer, you can wait for a few people to fall asleep so there are more people to prank.Try to be very quiet. Since there might be a lot of people participating in the prank, it’s easy to get carried away with the fun. But if you make too much noise, the sleeping person might wake up and your prank will be ruined.;
, If you want to make sure that none of your friends get upset by being the butt of your pranking jokes, then choose to prank someone else. This will keep you from having to explain anything to your friends (or their parents) in the morning.


Basically, this means prank calling someone else. Think of a funny prank call and enjoy it with all of your friends., This is especially important if you’re pranking one of your friends who is at the sleepover with you. Some people get easily embarrassed and upset. These are not good people to prank because they might not appreciate the humor. Think about who would think the prank is funny and pick that person to avoid hurt feelings.You don’t want to ruin the sleepover or cause a fight with your friends because of a silly prank.

, If you tell everyone that you’re planning pranks for the sleepover, then no one will want to fall asleep and it won’t be as funny because everyone will be expecting your pranks.If you want to prank people at the sleepover, wait until people start falling asleep and then tell your other friends about your funny plans to prank them.


Tell no one ahead of time about your prank plans. Or just tell one or two people who you know will love being in on the fun.

, There are many options for pranks and a lot of them involve physical humor. Come up with an idea that is funny and will keep your friends laughing for days. For example, you could try one of these pranks:


Put toothpaste on your friend’s fingers, then tickle their face. You could also use peanut butter or whipped cream.
Put shaving cream into his/her shoes.
If someone opens their mouth to snore, squirt sour spray!
Draw on them with a black (not permanent) marker. Make a silly design on their face or arms. Anything you can access without waking them up. Draw a mustache and a beard.Just make sure it is the kind of marker that will rub off easily.

, Prank calls are a great way to create hilarious memories with your friends. Just make sure you don’t call anyone that will be offended by your prank call. You should only call people who will appreciate the humor since it’s all in good fun.Try calling someone and asking someone if their refrigerator is running. When they say yes, tell them that they better go catch it!
You could also make prank calls using the cell phone of a person who already fell asleep at your sleepover. Just make sure you don’t do anything that could get them in trouble.

, Pranks that scare someone for a moment can be hilarious. But be careful to keep the joke lighthearted. You want the people that you prank to be able to realize it is a joke right away, rather than being legitimately scared. For example, you could try one of these pranks:


Put makeup on your face to make yourself look like an insane clown. Then wake up your friends!Hide in the shower behind the shower curtain and pop out when someone comes in to use the bathroom. Just make sure to do it before they start using the bathroom to avoid any awkwardness.

, Sometimes people do funny things in their sleep and it can be really funny to record it or to talk about it the next morning. But, even if no one does anything funny in their sleep, you can always pretend they did as another prank!


Tell someone they said funny stuff in their sleep. For example, you could tell your friend that while he was sleeping he said, ""I love the lunch-lady"".
If someone is a terrible sleep talker, record the funny things they say.

, Pranks can be a lot of fun, but you don’t want to leave a mess that takes days or weeks to clean up. Don’t use permanent marker if you draw on someone’s face or other body parts.

, You don’t want your friends’ parents to think you are a bad influence, so always avoid pranks that could get someone in trouble. Don’t do things that cause damage to people’s bodies or property.


This means avoid toilet-papering people’s houses or egging cars. Try not to ruin your clothes or make a huge mess. And definitely don’t do anything dangerous that could get someone hurt. Nothing ruins a prank faster than a necessary trip to the hospital., Pranking is only enjoyable when it’s all in good fun. If you use pranking as a way to bully someone you don’t like or to make someone else feel like they don’t belong, then this isn’t a prank. It’s just you being a bully. Only prank people who you know will respond well to it and who you are really friends with. Don’t use pranks as a way to exclude someone else., People might start getting annoyed at you if they think you always prank them, but you never let yourself be pranked. If you want the pranks to be all in good fun, you have to let yourself be the target sometimes. This means letting other people prank you and not getting upset about it.


You can also play pranks on yourself. For example, you could pour some water on the front of your pants and pretend that you accidentally wet yourself.

Stay positive.,
Remind yourself of your strengths.,
Study harder.,
Behave well in class.,
Try not to take criticism personally.,
Take care of your mental health.",How to Deal with a Teacher Picking on You2," Remember that one bad class will not ruin your career, your college prospects, or your life. You will not have to deal with this teacher forever, and sometimes these difficulties can help make you stronger. Focus on the positive aspects of your life. When you’re down about the class or the teacher’s remarks, think about your friends, favorite hobbies, and upcoming holidays.If you’re worried about this class affecting your college application, consider ways you can make up for the bad class. Take on extracurricular activities, volunteer, or work harder on other classes.

, Criticism can drain you and lower your self-esteem. Remind yourself about what you are good at. Tell yourself that you still have value and that you are still smart. Focus on talents outside of school like sports or music. You can get through this.


For example, just because you are not doing well in math class does not mean that you are stupid. In fact, you might be better with words and communication than numbers. That’s ok! People have different strengths.
Criticism is not about making you feel bad or less than. It's a way to help you grow, learn, and improve. Your essays won't improve if you don't get feedback on where they need work. Try not to look at the criticism as an attack, but instead as another learning tool.

, Even if you don’t think that you need to do more work, stepping up your productivity may solve the issue. Study every night, even if you do not have homework or a test. Memorize facts on notecards. Quiz yourself everyday. If you start performing better on tests, your teacher may back off. You may also be able to improve your overall grade before the end of the semester.Consider spending extra time with the teacher if they are willing to tutor you. Though it may be hard to spend more time with this teacher when you feel picked on, this can help you in a few ways. You will become more familiar with this particular teacher's way of phrasing questions for tests and which types of questions will be asked. In addition, your teacher will see how dedicated you are and might offer ways to bring up a grade with extra credit.

, Do not give your teacher any opening to discipline you. If you are truly having issues with them, the best route may simply be to avoid their negative attention. What this means is that you have to be on your best behavior.


Do not talk to friends during class.
Make sure your phone is turned off and put away.
Pay attention to what the teacher is saying.
Volunteer to answer questions.
Take notes. Do not doodle or draw while your teacher is talking.
Hand in your work on time., It is a teacher’s job to give you feedback and help you improve. While sometimes this can feel like a personal attack, you should learn how to cope with criticism. Teachers sometimes don't realize that they are being so hard on you or that you are so upset by it. It's just their way of teaching.


Take a deep breath. Meditate for a few minutes until you feel your anger or frustration leaving you.
Try to separate your self-worth from the grades you receive. What your teacher is commenting on is a specific task. They do not look down on you as a person.
Instead of considering how you failed, focus on how you can improve next time., If your situation is causing you to feel hopeless, isolated, reckless, or suicidal, you may be developing depression. You should not be ashamed or afraid to tell someone. Talk to your parents, and consider counseling."
"
Differentiate between criticism and abuse.,
Gather evidence.,
Involve your parents.,
Set up a meeting with the principal or guidance counselor.,
Discuss your options.",How to Deal with a Teacher Picking on You3," Criticism can sound mean, especially when you have poured your heart into an assignment or class. That said, the administration probably cannot help you if your teacher is merely being a harsh critic. You will have to prove that the teacher is specifically bullying you or that their remarks are abusive. Criticism offers you a way to improve where abuse means that the teacher has predetermined your grade without good reason.


Criticism includes remarks like, “You need to proofread your paper,” or, “If you don’t show your work, you will not receive credit.” These may come off as harsh, but they are not abusive.
Abusive comments include threats, insults, or personal attacks. These include comments like, “If you don’t shut up, I’m going to fail you,” or, “You’re so stupid. I can’t expect you to understand how to do this correctly.”

, Write down in a journal every time your teacher mocks, humiliates, or insults you. Make sure to note the date and the cause of this abuse. If you have any evidence of your teacher’s harassment, bring it with you. This includes emails in which they have insulted you, harsh assessments, or misgraded tests. The principal or administrator will review these and decide whether or not they were unfair., If you are frightened or upset when the teacher picks on you, tell your parents. They can tell you if they think the teacher is just doing their job correctly or if they should talk to the teacher about picking on you. Teachers and administration will probably respect your parents more, and they may be more likely to listen to them., If you are confident that your teacher is intentionally bullying you, you should go to the administration to make a complaint.Ask to make an appointment with the principal. You may be referred to a guidance counselor instead.


This is a last resort. If you meet with the principal and they decide that the teacher was right, the teacher may have a grudge against you.
You can also have your parents call and make the appointment. Administration may be more willing to listen to them. Ask one of your parents to come with you to the meeting if possible.

, Make it clear during your meeting that you would like to discuss options for fixing the problem. After presenting any evidence you have, ask the principal if you can switch classes, make the class up in summer school, or drop the class. Be aware that it is very unlikely that your teacher will be punished. Instead, the principal will probably either tell you to resolve your issues yourself or move you to a different class.You can try saying, “I do not think that I will be given a fair grade in this class because I am not given opportunities to improve. I want to know if it is possible for me to be moved to another teacher’s class. I’d even be willing to make it up over summer.”
Instead of complaining that you received bad grades, point out specific instances when the teacher gave you an unfair mark and explain why you think it was undeserved.

If your teacher is abusive, then a complaint can be made to the principal and possibly the school board. You will need thorough documentation of the abuse (a detailed, written record, or even a recording if possible) and you will need your parent's help. Don't try to do this alone.

If nothing can be done, decide if you want to take further action.",How to Deal With a Mean Teacher," Though you may think that your teacher is the meanest person in the world, you should try having some compassion to see if there may be something more going on. Try to think about why your teacher is being “mean” and if this is because your teacher feels disrespected in the classroom. Maybe all of the students are mean, maybe many of them don’t take the material seriously, or maybe a handful of students are so disruptive that it’s impossible to learn. Your teacher may be “mean” because he or she feels like there’s no other way to get people to listen.


Putting yourself in another person’s shoes is a skill that can be useful for the rest of your life. Developing empathy and compassion can help you in social and work situations for the rest of your life. Learning to step outside yourself can help you see a situation in a new light and solve problems. You should tell him or her how you feel.
Of course, it can be hard to see your teacher as anyone other than a mean person who is getting you down, but you should remember that she’s only human, too.;
, If you’re dealing with a mean teacher, then your natural impulse may be to prove your teacher wrong, to make your teacher feel bad about him or herself, or just to be a wise guy in the classroom. However, if you try to fight fire with fire, that is only guaranteed to make the situation worse. Instead of trying to outsmart your teacher, work on being positive towards your teacher, helping him or her out when it’s needed, and being a good student. If you make an effort to be kinder to your teacher, then he or she will return the favor.


Though it may be challenging to be nice to a person you don’t like, it can help her be nicer to you, which can lead to better feelings all around. This is another skill you may need to use later on in life, so it’s best to get some practice, now.
Don’t think of it as being fake. Think of it as making the situation as bearable as possible for everybody.

, Another way to deal with a mean teacher is to work on being positive in the classroom, instead of arguing or complaining about every little thing. Don’t spend so much time complaining that the last test was hard; instead, ask yourself if you can do better next time if you study more. Don’t talk about how Charlotte’s Web was the most boring book you’ve ever had to read; instead, focus on the parts of it you really liked. Being more positive toward your teacher will help set a more positive tone in the classroom, and it should lead your teacher to be less mean.


Try to focus on the things you do like about the learning experience. Being excited about new material will make class more fun for you, and will make your teacher less likely to be mean. She will be more inclined to soften if she sees that you genuinely care.
Think about it: it can be pretty discouraging for your teacher to teach something he or she is really excited about, only to get groans and eye rolls in response. Of course that would encourage meanness.

, Talking back to your teacher won’t get you anywhere. Sure, you’ll experience some brief satisfaction at telling her off and might make your friends giggle, but this will only lead you to make your teacher resent you more and to become more mean. If you have something to say, talk to her or him after class in a calm and reasonable manner instead of trying to show off during class.


You may see other students talking back and may think this is appropriate. However, it’s your job to rise above the common denominator and set an example for others.
If you disagree with your teacher, try to be as respectful as possible, and ask her questions instead of making statements that make her feel wronged.

, Figuring out what motivates your teacher can really help you deal with her. If your teacher is being mean because no one is participating, then try to speak up more in class. If your teacher is mean because she feels disrespected, then try to stop laughing at her behind her back. If she’s mean because no one is paying attention, then make an extra effort to answer her questions and to put away any distractions. Giving her what she wants can help her become less mean.


Believe it or not, but everyone has a soft spot. Maybe your teacher is really into cats. Doing something as simple as telling her about your cat or asking to see pictures of hers can make her open up to you a bit.
Even giving your teacher a real compliment, like saying you like a new poster on the wall, can help motivate your teacher to be nice if he or she takes a lot of pride in his or her classroom.

, Sometimes, your teacher really is behaving poorly and her actions are not justified. If your teacher is truly mean and is hurting your feelings, making fun of you, and making you and the other students feel inadequate, then you may need to take further action. First, you should take some time to document all of the things your teacher says and write them down; then, you can take these comments and actions to your parents and discuss what to do next.


Don’t make this too obvious. Just bring a notebook to class and write down the upsetting things your teacher says. You can also make a mental note of them and write them down after class.
Though generally saying your teacher is mean can have an impact, just as you might have learned in school, solid arguments need to be made with specific examples. The more specific examples you have about your teacher’s meanness, the more convincing your case will be.

, One way to make sure your teacher isn’t mean to you is to respect her rules. One of the rudest and most disrespectful things you can do is to get to class late, especially if you make a habit of it. This is a way of telling your teacher that you don’t care at all about her class and to get her on your bad side immediately. If you are late, then you should apologize and make sure it doesn’t happen again.


Don’t be one of those kids who packs up all of this things when there’s five minutes left of class. The need to leave early will drive your teacher even crazier than being late to class.

, If you want to deal with a mean teacher, then you should really make an effort to listen to what the teacher is telling you. One of the reasons teachers may seem mean is because they feel like their students aren’t listening to them and like they’re not getting any respect. When your teacher is talking, listen carefully and avoid getting distracted by your phone, the people in the halls, or your classmates.


Though it’s important to ask questions, one of the things that can make teachers mean is students who ask very obvious questions about things their teachers have stated again and again. Make sure you listen carefully so you don’t make this mistake.

, Taking notes will show your teacher that you really do care about his or her class and that you’re not just there to pass the time. It will also make you gain an understanding of the subject matter and will show your teacher that you really care about the class. Teachers also like to see their students taking notes when they talk because it’s a sign that they’re paying attention. Make a habit of taking notes as often as you can so your teacher starts to feel more kindly towards you.


Taking notes will also help you do better in school, and this can make your teacher nicer, too.

, It’s possible that your teacher is being mean to you because he or she thinks you don’t care about the class at all. This may be because you haven’t been making an effort to participate. The next time you get a chance, you should raise your hand to answer your teacher’s questions, volunteer to help your teacher out, or be active in a group discussion. This will make your teacher see that you really do care and he or she will be kinder towards you.


Though you shouldn’t try to answer every question every time, make an effort to be engaged in the material so your teacher is more inclined to be nice.
Participating in class will not only make your teacher nicer, but it will also make the learning experience more fun for you. If you’re more engaged in the material, you’ll be less likely to get bored or distracted in class.

, If you want to get on your teacher’s good side, then you should avoid talking to your friends unless you’re engaged in a group activity. This is distracting for teachers and makes them feel like you don’t care about them at all. The next time your friends try to laugh with you or pass you a note, make them see that you want to focus on the class and that you’ll talk to them later.


If you have a chance to choose your seat, try to sit away from your friends or distracting students so your teacher has less reason to be mean to you.

,, If you’re dealing with a mean teacher, then chances are that the other students often make fun of him or her. Though it may be tempting to join in on their antics or even to lead the pack, you should hold back and avoid making fun of your teacher, because this is guaranteed to only make your teacher feel angrier and act meaner. You may think you’re being clever, but it’s very likely that your teacher is on to you if you’re openly making fun of him or her in class.


Teachers are people, too, and they can be sensitive. If your teacher catches you making fun of him or her, then it’ll be hard to win your teacher over again.
If your friends are teasing your teacher, try to separate yourself from them. You don’t want to be associated with that kind of behavior.

, One way to make your teacher less mean to you is to ask for extra help with the material after class. You may be terrified of being alone with your teacher, but you’d be surprised to find that most teachers actually love sharing their wisdom on the subjects they teach and that your teacher would actually be very happy to help you. If you have a test coming up in a week or two or have a concept you don’t quite understand, then ask your teacher if he or she can help you after school one day; you’d be surprised by how much nicer your teacher will act after you ask.


This should work most of the time. However, if your teacher is really very mean, then he or she may turn you down, but it’s worth trying.
If you do choose to ask for help, the important thing is to ask well in advance before any tests. If you ask for help a day or two before the test, your teacher may get angry and may wonder why you didn’t ask sooner.

, Though being a good student and respecting your teacher’s rules can definitely make your teacher less mean to you, you don’t want to take it too far. If your teacher thinks that you’re sucking up and not being genuine, and if you try a little too hard to answer your teacher’s questions, compliment your teacher, or to hover around your teacher’s desk, asking how you can help, then your teacher may actually act meaner because he or she will be suspicious of your true intentions.


If your teacher is naturally mean, then he or she will naturally be suspicious of a student who is trying too hard to get in his or her good graces. Make it feel natural.

, When it comes to dealing with a mean teacher, the first thing you need to do is to get the facts straight. Talk to your child about what the teacher did and why the teacher is really mean. Make sure your child has specific examples instead of just saying the teacher is generally mean; if your child doesn’t have many examples, ask him to go to school and try to write some down to show you what mean things the teacher did. This will give you a better sense of the situation.


Sit your child down and have a frank conversation about the teacher. Make sure the child takes the time to tell you as much as he can in as much detail as possible instead of just making passing comments.
If your child is crying or very upset when talking about the teacher, help him calm down so you can get more concrete information.

, Of course, it can be challenging to see if your child is really experiencing unfairness because you love him so much and can’t stand the idea of anyone being mean to him. However, you have to make sure that what your child is telling you is an indication that the teacher is really out of line and that this behavior needs to be stopped. If your child is being sensitive and has made a similar complaint about many teachers before, then you have to think carefully before taking action.


Of course, your first instinct should be to trust and protect your child, but you need to think about how your child’s behavior may be impacting your teacher. Consider the possibility that both your child and the teacher may be at fault.

, Another thing you can do is to talk to the other parents of the children in your school to see if they’ve heard similar complaints from their kids. If they’ve heard similar comments, then this will help you see that the situation needs to be stopped. Of course, just because they haven’t heard anything doesn’t mean that the teacher isn’t really acting inappropriately, but it’s good to cover your bases.


You don’t need to pry too much, but it won’t hurt to casually mention that your child has been running into some trouble with his or her teacher, and to see if their children have made similar comments.
Strength in numbers is important. If there are more parents who are angry about the teacher, it’s more likely that some action can be taken.

, If your child is really being hurt by your teacher or is just telling you that she’s mean, then it may be time to set up a meeting with the teacher to see for yourself. Either the teacher will prove your child right and will be mean and dismissive in person, or the teacher may cover up her meanness and will pretend that everything is fine; additionally, you may find that the teacher isn’t as mean as you expected, and you will have to decide what to do next.


Take the time to really get a sense of who the teacher is and what he or she may be frustrated about. If your teacher is mean or demeaning when talking about your child, or just generally seems to dislike his students, then you may have a problem.
Trust your gut. If the teacher seems nice, do you think she’s faking it, or does it feel genuine?

, If you’re convinced, after talking to the teacher or your child, that further action really needs to be taken, then it’s time to take the matter to the school principal or other administrators. You don’t want your child to be in a learning environment that is very discouraging and keeps him or her from being excited about learning and coming to school. Set up an appointment with the administrators at your earliest convenience and plan exactly what you’re going to say.


Use the concrete details your child has given you to show that the behavior is inappropriate. You can’t just say the teacher is mean, but you can point to several things the teacher said that were out of line.
If other parents are with you on this, then having them also make appointments with the administrators, or even setting up a group meeting, can have an even larger impact.

, Unfortunately, your complaints with administrators may not be enough to move the needle. At that point, you can decide what, if any, further action needs to be taken. You may see if you can place your child in a different class or even if it’s worth it to switch schools. Or alternately, if you think these drastic steps aren’t worth it, then you may need to have a conversation with your child about getting through the year and not letting the mean teacher shake his confidence.If you decide not to take further action, you can talk to your child about how this is a life lesson. Unfortunately, in life, we sometimes have to deal with people we really don’t like. Learning how to cooperate with them and not letting them get to you is an important skill that can help us get through life. This may not feel like the most comforting answer, but this may be the best you can do.

Think about how much of this information you're willing to share with your teacher. They may ask the reason for the retake, and you should be honest. If it's personal, you can make general allusions: ""family problems,"" or ""a difficult personal period."" It's unlikely your teacher will pry.;
, If you have the test with you, look through your work and the teacher's comments, if any. Are your mistakes clear to you? Jot down any questions you might have., If it was a simple matter of not studying, then you can solve the issue easily. Some circumstances may need a little more attention. Before you talk to your teacher, you should have a plan for what you can do to succeed on the retake.If you're distracted by a personal issue, be proactive about dealing with what's bothering you. Failing one test because of it is a sign that it might be affecting your other academic work, not to mention making you unhappy. Talking to friends or your school guidance counselor might help.
If you're struggling with the material, now's the time to find a tutor who can help you better understand it.

, Your teacher might want to give you the test again within a day or two, so be ready. If you think you're going to need more time, but want to talk to the teacher as soon as possible, be prepared to tell the teacher when you expect you'll be able to retake the test.

, After a class or after school are usually good times.


You might need just a few minutes to talk to your teacher, or this could be a longer conversation. It's a good idea to ask your teacher after class when a good time would be to come talk with them. They might be free then; if not, they'll suggest a better time.Don't approach your teacher before class. This is often a busy moment for teachers and they're likely to be distracted.

, Having your test on hand may help the teacher assess what you need to work on if they let you retake the test. They may have forgotten your grade, as well, particularly if you're in a large class.


Also bring any questions you wrote down while looking over your test. Come prepared.

, Don't immediately launch into the reasons why you failed; this might make your teacher suspect that you're making up an excuse.

, Tell your teacher that you accept responsibility for the test and that you're trying to be responsible by asking for a retake.


This also makes it clear that you do not blame the teacher for your poor results.

, It's very possible your teacher will ask why you need the retake. In that case, be honest. Letting them know helps them assess how they can best help you succeed in their class.

, They might ask you to study an hour a night if you're not reaching standard.


If you're struggling with the material, ask your teacher for help. They won't be able to reteach everything right then and there, but they may be able to point you in the right direction.
If you're considering getting a tutor, ask your teacher if they can recommend someone.

, Teachers may have their reasons for allowing or not allowing retakes, and you need to respect their decision. At the very least, hopefully you've learned a little more about their expectations and how to better prepare next time.

, Cramming for tests is never a good idea; instead, set a daily routine for yourself that includes doing homework on time and reviewing material from class. This time should be quiet, focused, and uninterrupted.


If you don't know where to begin, ask your teacher to help.

, Some subjects and topics can be particularly difficult. Find out if your school has a tutoring program and sign up for some sessions. Alternatively, you can ask your teacher, guidance counselor or another student to recommend a tutor for the subject you're struggling with.

, Unfortunately, we don't take tests in a vacuum, and life circumstances can often affect our ability to perform our best in school. If you're going through a difficult period, talk to family, friends, or a counselor. High schools and universities usually offer free counseling for their students.

Make sure the teacher actually marked it wrong.,
Be humble.,
Understand that she didn't mean to mark it wrong.,
Don't criticize.,
Talk to his/her supervisor or boss if the problem doesn't stop.",How to Behave when Your Teacher Has Not Checked Your Paper Correctly," Check with your friends to see what they got. If they had the same answer marked correctly, you have a chance. You'll look like an idiot to the teacher if it turns out that you actually got it wrong.;
, When you approach your teacher, don't be cocky or try to embarrass him/her. Walk up to her before or after class, don't be a jerk, or he/she might not correct the grade for you.

, S/He'll probably be gratified that you caught his/her error. Don't hold a grudge or be a smart aleck.

, Make suggestions in between compliments. For example: ""I truly enjoy your teaching and think you're great at your job...but (go on to say what s/he did wrong.""

, Send an anonymous formal letter specifying the problems in the classroom. If you have to, bring this issue to the school board anonymously.

, A sleepover usually turns into an all-nighter! Find out who will bring what. Remember to get food, drinks, and video games!

, If the ""sleepover"" is in your room, clean your room and set out the sleeping bags and the video game systems. Make sure you stack the video games into a pile so you can see the title of them.

, Make it look like a buffet! Everyone should have a plate and a cup. Basically, it should look like you're having dinner. This way, things are convenient and awesome.

, Bring your friends over and start partying! Just don't wake up your parents. Be sure to have some caffeine! Whether it's soda or coffee, you need to stay awake.

Take a deep breath.,
Don't drop the class immediately.,
Decide if it's toughness or bad teaching.,
Understand professors challenge you to do better.",How to Deal with a Demanding Professor1," Plenty of professors like to act tough up front to weed out anyone who doesn't belong in the class. Keep in mind that it's often just a tactic. Of course, the class may still be plenty difficult, but you may find that your professor drops some of the toughness act later on., When you clash heads with a professor early on (or just find that you don't like the professor very much), it's best to try to stick it out for at least a week or two. If the professor teaches classes in your department, you may not be able to avoid them throughout your college career, so it's best to try to get along with them now if possible. Also, if you try to take the class again another semester, you may find that a different professor is even worse., It's important to make this distinction. You can learn a great deal from a tough teacher, while a bad teacher may just be a waste of time. Bad teachers may not explain the material well, may assign busywork, or may just be rude. Any of the above may be a good reason to drop the class. With a tough teacher, you'll find the class difficult, but you'll also likely find that over time, you're learning a lot from them., That is, you may think your professor is being especially demanding of you because they don't like you. However, it may be that the opposite is true. They may enjoy challenging you because they see your potential and because they like seeing you grow. While this realization won't change how they treat you, it can change how you feel about it."

Ask good questions in class.,
Email as needed.,
Show up at office hours.,
Talk to teaching assistants.,
Don't blame the professor.,
Stand up for yourself when needed.",How to Deal with a Demanding Professor2," Asking good questions shows your professor you're interested in the course, not just sitting their idly. The best questions include material from past classes or from outside reading, as that demonstrates you're actually retaining material from week to week.For instance, you might ask something like, ""That's an interesting point you just brought up. How does that relate to what our textbook says about the subject?""

, Another way you can show you are committed to the course is to email your professor when you have a question. Emailing is also a way to get a leg up if you're having trouble. The key to emailing your professor is to have a purpose to the email, and then follow general academic email etiquette.Start it out like a letter. That is, begin with ""Dear Professor Roberts,"" You can substitute ""Dr."" for professor if that's how the professor refers to themselves on the syllabus. However, make sure to use the professor's last name and to spell it correctly.
The first sentence should be a nicety. Start with, ""I hope you had a nice weekend,"" or ""I hope you're enjoying the nice weather.""
In the next paragraph, let them know who you are. Say your name and what class you're in. If you can distinguish yourself in some other way (such as I'm the girl with the pink hair in the back row), do so.
Bring up your question, as well as the action you'd like the professor to take, such as ""I have a question about the reading. I'm not quite understanding . Is there any additional reading you could recommend to help me understand it?""
Make sure your question isn't answered by the syllabus.
End the email with ""Thank you,"" and your name.

, One way to show you're willing to go the extra mile is to show up during office hours. You can ask a question that's been bugging you, for instance. You could also ask for extra reading materials to help you understand the class better. Your professor will appreciate that you're willing to go above and beyond.You could say, ""Hi, Professor Roberts. I've been having trouble with this concept. I was wondering if we could talk about it or if you could point me in the direction of some extra reading materials.""

, Larger universities often have graduate teaching assistants to help in big classes. These assistants help the professor with coursework and grading, but they are also there to provide you with assistance. If you're having trouble with a professor, consider asking a teaching assistant for help in how to do better in the class.Start with, ""Hello! I've been having trouble with Professor Roberts' class. I was wondering if you had any tips on how to do better.""

, When you don't understand something or you're having a hard time, it can be tempting to blame the professor to their face. That, however, will get you nowhere. Instead, focus on getting your problem solved to the best of your ability. Blaming your professor will only make life more difficult for you.For instance, don't say, ""You didn't teach this material very well in class."" Rather, say, ""I don't understand this concept very well. Is there some extra reading I can do to understand it better?""

, If you notice a mistake in grading, for instance, don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. Most professors are willing to admit when they've made a mistake, and they'll work to get it corrected. However, it's probably best to approach your professor during office hours, rather than at the end of class when they need to dash off somewhere.Try to be relaxed when asking about a grade. You could say, ""Hi, professor. I had a question about my recent grade. Do you mind if we talk about it?""

Realize you're in college now.,
Be a model student.,
Rely on your classmates.,
Try not to focus on just the grade.",How to Deal with a Demanding Professor3," If you have a tough professor in your first or second semester of college, it can be a shock. College is more demanding than high school, both in the amount of work you have and in the type of thinking you'll be required to do. You'll need to change how you think about school. It's your number one priority right now, and you may need to make adjustments in how you study.If you haven't been a devoted student in the past, you may need to change up some of your habits. Try making a study schedule, so that you know how much time you have to devote to each class.
If you need to, get help. You should have tutoring options available on campus. If you don't have those options, consider hiring a private tutor for the semester.

, Being a model student can help you show your professor you want to work hard. That includes things like showing up to class on time and taking notes while in class. You should also do all the reading and try to participate in class without being called on. Finally, make sure you are doing all the assignments, putting your best effort into them, and turning them in on time., When you have a demanding professor, your classmates can help save you. You can have study groups to help you understand the material better, for instance, or work together on tough problems together when you can't figure out. Having other perspectives can only help in a tough class., If every interaction with your professor includes you talking about your grade, you're not likely to win them over. That is, the professor wants you to be interested in the coursework and learning, not just getting a good grade. Showing interest in what's going on in class will help you engage with the professor."

Always come prepared to the teacher's class.,
Get involved in classroom discussions!,

If you hear any of your friends insulting the teacher, defend him or her.,
Wave or say ""Hi"" to them when you see them.,
Always appear as hard working as possible.,
Always remember to say to the teacher hello or goodbye.,
If a teacher has punished you and you become furious, try not to lose your temper.",How to Become a Teacher's Pet," You want to make yourself presentable. Wash and brush your hair, brush your teeth, shower and wear deodorant. Make sure you dress appropriately. Try to wear smart and professional things. One of the most important things is to not wear pants that are falling down, or a shirt that shows your stomach. You and your friends may think it's cool, but showing that you make an effort to come to school is much better. Always dress according to the weather, it shows that you want to be safe and warm, and you don't want to get sick.;
, Is it going to be your homeroom teacher, a PE coach, an art or music teacher, the teacher of your favorite subjects, or all of them? You might want to start with the ""nicest"" teacher, or with the subject you know the most about. If you want to become teacher's pet to multiple teachers, make sure you have time to manage all the extra effort you should put into their class. Acknowledge that classroom as your home turf; you're going to learn a lot about that subject soon, and become an expert, so you might as well feel at home in the place where it's taught.

, Unless they are talking about their personal life, ""What's your favorite sports team?"" will not go over very well. Teachers love kids who are quiet when they speak.

, You want to have all the homework done with a lot of effort put into it. Projects should be ready to turn in soon after being assigned, and try your best to be creative in all of your work. You also might want to read over the lesson before the class so you are extra prepared for participating and you can stun the teacher with your knowledge of the subject.

, Any answer you give shows the teacher that you were listening, and any well thought question shows the teacher how you are trying to apply what they teach to real life. In a class where everyone seems asleep, raising your hand shows that you care.

, This one is pretty simple. Don't laugh at the class clown either because that supports him/her interrupting the class.

, Talk to him/her about what you learned and how much you enjoyed their lesson (they'll love this). But not too much, teachers can sense false sensitivity.


Ask for extra credit. This shows that you want a high grade. If they say no, don't whine. Just say ""Okay, see you tomorrow!""







, Don't use slang language because it will show them that you don't care if your writing is good or bad. Make your writing meaningful, so that after a long night of correcting, the teacher will look forward to reading yours! Avoid writing too much, though. You don't want to make that long night of correcting longer by forcing your teacher to read your Great American Novel.

, Teachers don't like people who start fights or contribute to them. Try to stay away from the goofballs of the class. Help out whenever possible; whether it be the teacher or the student.

, Study for any test that comes up. When you receive the test back, ask the teacher how to do the ones you got wrong (you might want to do this in private). You don't have to point out that this is because you want to know better for next time; there's no other reason why you'd ask, and you're not looking for a goody-two-shoes label.

, Ask if there are any books they can recommend to you.

,, They will appreciate your kindness.

, You can discuss anything you want--don't just limit it to school. Teachers are human. Joke around a little, but don't be too wild.

, You never know where your teacher has eyes or ears. Also, being a teacher's pet is a two-way relationship: it will function much better if you happen to like the teacher in question, too.

, People like to be acknowledged.

, Bring in extra thoughtful questions, and if you're a bit shy, don't be afraid to go after school. ""Oh, I forgot to ask you..."" is a good starting line. You can also spend some spare time in your teacher's office, if the situation allows.

, Whenever you meet your teacher, wish a cheery Hello. Try saying things like ""thank you, have a good day or good luck teaching!"" when wishing.

, At the end of the lesson, ""Goodbye Miss/Sir, I am sorry for (whatever wrong thing you did) I'll try not to repeat it again."" is a good thing to say to cool down your teacher if he/she is frustrated with you.

Address any specific incidents.,
Explain any potential misunderstandings.,
Be prepared for class.,
Work against unjustified bad impressions.",How to Change a Teacher's Bad Impression of You1," There are many reasons a teacher might have a bad impression of you. If you can identify a specific thing you did or said that gave the teacher a bad impression, let them know you understand it. This can be huge way to show maturity.Apologize if that is appropriate. For example, you could say, “I’m really sorry I was late on the first day of class. I’m sure that didn’t give a very good impression. However, that was definitely an exception and I plan to always be on time from now on.”
Don’t overdo it. Generally, a sincere apology followed by meaningful action is enough. Don’t repeat your apology or beg for forgiveness.;
, Your teacher may make assumptions about you based on your appearance or behavior. After all, they’ve probably met a lot of students and think they’re able to tell a lot about a student pretty quickly. If you think you’re being misunderstood or judged, help your teacher understand who you really are.There might be things about your appearance that cause a teacher to judge you. Take a minute to consider if there’s anything your teacher might be noticing and judging. For example, if you walk into the first day of class with black eye, they might assume you’re the kind of person who gets into fights.
Simply explain away the misunderstanding by telling the truth. You can say something like, “I know this black eye looks pretty scary. I actually got it playing baseball last week when my team went to the state championships.”

, Teachers notice who’s engaged in class and who comes prepared. If your teacher has a bad impression of you, it could be that they’ve noticed that you don’t show up to class prepared or that you aren’t taking responsibility for your own learning.Prepare for class. This doesn’t necessarily mean studying hard or even doing your homework. It means being ready to engage with your teacher and classmates. This includes getting enough sleep and coming to class eager to learn.
Always have handy any necessary materials such as books, notebooks, or pencils. This shows that you’re taking responsibility for your role as a student.

, Your teacher might have a bad impression of you without you knowing why. This can be very difficult. Sometimes, teachers are just judgemental. Sometimes you remind them of another student they had in the past. Do what you can to show them that you're worthy of more consideration.


Be kind and patient with your teacher. That's probably how you like to be treated, too.
If you think the treatment you're getting is really unfair, try asking them why they seem to think badly of you. Letting them know that you notice and are concerned can go a long way.

"
Ask meaningful questions in class.,
Complete all assignments on time.,
Make extra efforts in your work.,
Ask for extra help if you need it.,
Respect the teacher’s authority on a subject.,
Let your teacher know who you are.,
Embrace things you and your teacher may have in common.,
Be honest about your struggles.,
Remember that your teacher has a life outside of school, too.,
Smile and act friendly.,
Accept the grades you’re given.,
Be helpful to your teacher.,
Talk to your teacher if you feel unfairly treated.",How to Become a Teacher's Favorite," Asking questions shows that you care about the subject matter. It also shows that you’re paying attention. Some people fear that asking questions will make people think they’re not smart. Actually, asking questions is a great indicator of intelligence and a desire to learn.If you’re going to ask questions, you need to pay attention. For example, if you ask, “When is that assignment due?” and your teacher has already said the due date once, they will think you’re not listening.
Be mindful not to ask so many questions that you derail the class and prevent the teacher from finishing the lesson.;
, This one can be difficult if you have a lot of work, or if you tend to procrastinate. However, turning in assignments on time shows your teacher that you are prioritizing their class.Teachers have busy lives and need time off, just like you. They may have planned to grade all of your class’ papers on Wednesday night. If you turn your paper in on Friday, they will likely be frustrated that they now have to grade your paper over the weekend.
If you know that you won’t be able to meet a deadline, talk to your teacher about it in advance. They may be able to grant you an extension.

, It’s always good to do more than the bare minimum for an assignment. Extra efforts can include binding your paper in a nice way to make it more presentable, or doing extra research for an assignment.If a teacher asks for a paper to be a certain length, you can aim to write something a little bit longer than requested, but not much. This shows that you weren’t just stretching to meet the minimum.
If you make your paper too long, your teacher may think you’re sucking up or they may not like having to do that much extra reading.

, Asking for help shows your teacher that you want to succeed. Many teachers look for this quality in a student, because if you want to succeed you’re likely to take their help and suggestions seriously.Don’t be afraid to approach your teacher during their free period or at the end of the day.
You may need help understanding the subject matter, or knowing how to complete the assignment. You should feel comfortable asking for whatever kind of help you need.

, Teachers have been through a lot of education and they have chosen a profession where they get to share their knowledge. You may know a lot about a subject as well, but teachers will appreciate if you treat them as the experts they are.Occasionally it’s okay to correct your teacher. After all, everyone makes mistakes sometimes.
Many teachers are wary of “know-it-all” students. Not only will acting like a know-it-all jeopardize your relationship with your teacher, it may also annoy your classmates.

, Teachers can tell when a student isn’t being themselves. For example, if you’re a science fiction geek or a competitive athlete, those are important things that help define who you are. Never try to hide those things just to look like the perfect student.If you’re naturally a goofball or “class clown,” you may need to control yourself some to avoid disrupting class. However, most teachers have a sense of humor and will appreciate some silliness or joking in class.
Don’t let your personality distract from class. For example, if you’re a social butterfly, you can wait until the bell rings to hand out the invitations to your party. You don’t need to do that during class.

, This may be the only proven thing that determines which students will become a teacher’s favorite. You may remind them of themselves at your age, or of someone they are close to. You may share interests or hobbies. If your teacher senses that you have something in common, they are likely to favor you.Sometimes, your teacher might just feel that you have similar personalities. For example, they might be able to identify with the fact that you’re shy, or that you get easily frustrated.
If you know your teacher shares an interest with you, you can connect with them over that. For example, if your teacher loves art, you could bring in a review of the latest exhibition at the local art museum to share with them.

, This can be difficult, especially if you’re shy. However, most teachers will appreciate a student who can be honest and confide in them. If you’re struggling with school work, or having trouble at home, letting your teacher know will likely endear you to them.If you’re having trouble outside of school (such as at home or at a job) let your teacher know. They might be able to extend deadlines for you or help you talk to a guidance counselor.
Be careful not to come across as whiny or complaining. Teachers can tell the difference between a student who is truly struggling and one who simply doesn’t want to do the work.

, Teachers like to relax and have fun on the weekends just like you. Sometimes it might seem like they only exist to make your life miserable; but remember that they probably became a teacher because they like working with young people and love helping them learn.Show interest in your teacher’s life. You can ask them how their weekend was, or what they have planned for summer vacation.

, Imagine if you came into work and everyone around you had a bad attitude. That’s what it can feel like for a teacher with a room full of grumpy students. Acting friendly and being happy to see your teacher will brighten their day and help them feel appreciated by you.A teacher can tell when a student is genuinely being friendly or just sucking up. Don’t go too far and start acting fake.

, You and your teacher might disagree about the grade you deserve in a class. However, your teacher has probably given your grade a lot of consideration. If you contest the grade your teacher gave you, they’ll think you care more about your grades than about the learning process. They also may feel that you’re disrespecting their authority.If you’re concerned that your grades are not what you wanted them to be, talk to your teacher about how you can get better grades next time.

, Teaching can be difficult, and teachers get tired, just like you. If you notice that your teacher could use a hand, offer to help out. They’ll definitely notice and appreciate your helpful attitude.You can help your teacher by erasing the board, passing out papers, or bringing something to the office for them.
If you arrive to class early, you can always ask if there’s anything you can do to help them prepare for class.

, If your teacher has not been treating you fairly, it’s okay to approach them about it. Ask them if you can speak with them during lunch or after school. Even if right now it seems that your teacher hates you, being able to have a mature conversation with them will likely turn the tide. Your teacher will see that you're invested in the relationship and in the class.Act calm and respectful when you speak to your teacher. You can say, “I’m not sure if you’ve noticed this, but I feel that I’m not being treated fairly in class.”
It’s great to be able to give specific examples so your teacher can see what you’re talking about. You can say, “When Maria made a joke and the class laughed, you laughed too. But when I made a joke and everyone laughed you sent me to the office. I don’t feel like that’s fair.”

Pay attention in class.,
Be polite.,
Ask questions.,
Participate actively.",How to Build a Good Reputation with Teachers1," For many teachers, the mark of a good student isn’t being the smartest person in the class, but being the one who is willing to put in effort. Pay attention to your teacher, takes notes in class, and don’t be afraid to raise your hand and answer questions.If you are having a hard time keeping up with your teacher while taking notes, ask after class if you can have a copy of their lecture notes or the lecture presentation.
Don’t worry about copying notes down exactly as your teacher says them. Instead, take notes that make sense to you. This may mean copying full sentences, getting down key words, dates, and formulas, or even drawing or doodling.
If there is something you didn’t understand from class, ask your teacher if you can meet with them during lunch or after class to get clarification.;
, Your teachers are people, too, and they deserve the same courtesy you would show anyone else. Maintain good manners in the classroom by making eye contact when your teacher speaks directly to you, saying please and thank you, asking to be excused, and following the classroom code of conduct.Pay attention to the way your teacher asks you to address them. Some may prefer Mr. or Ms., while others might choose to go by a title like Dr. if they have earned a PhD.
Take a close look at your classroom’s code of conduct, which should be outlined in your course syllabus. Follow it as closely as you can. Do not, for example, ask for your teacher’s permission to leave the class if they state in there that they prefer you simply go and not interrupt the class.

, When there is something you do not understand or want to clarify, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Try to avoid asking facts that you can find in your book, such as dates or formulas, but do speak up if you want to further review class concepts, such as why that date was significant or how to use that formula.Never be afraid to ask because you think your question isn’t intelligent or valuable. Chances are, if you don’t understand, there is someone else in the class that wants clarification, too.
Asking questions relevant to the lesson material shows your teacher you are actually listening and trying to engage with the class materials.

, Be active in class discussions. If your teacher asks a question and you know the answer, raise your hand. If you do not agree with what someone, even your teacher, says, do not be afraid to explain your reasoning, but do so politely and respectfully.Participate in class, but do not do so to the detriment of your classmates. Avoid shouting out answers or speaking up every time the teacher addresses the class. Allow your peers the opportunity to speak, too.
Don’t just answer questions. Be willing to volunteer for demonstrations and for class activities, as well.
Ask your teacher if they need any assistance running errands for the class or department. This may include making copies before or after class, or helping your teacher get supplies from other classrooms.

Raise your hand.,
Listen to the teacher.,
Don’t brag or gloat.,
Don't dominate class discussion.,
Don’t be rude in class.,
Ask questions during office hours.",How to Be Your Math Teacher's Favorite Student1," When the teacher asks a question that you know how to answer, put your hand up. When you have an opportunity, volunteer to attempt problems on the board in front of your class. The more you participate, the more chances you will have to interact with your teacher and develop a rapport.


If you are not sure about a question, but no other classmates raise their hand, volunteer to attempt to answer the problem. Teachers typically seek out ways to encourage more participation and will appreciate the example that you set.Class participation can be especially challenging or uncomfortable for foreign students. If you are participating in a study abroad or an exchange program, pay attention to how other students participate and mimic their behavior. Don’t be afraid to approach your teacher before or after class to discuss their expectations for classroom participation.;
, Teachers work hard to prepare lessons and effectively manage classrooms. Show that you appreciate this work by listening closely and focusing on the subject matter. Teachers will appreciate your show of interest in the subject, especially in contrast to other students who may show a lack of interest in the class.


If you find it difficult to pay attention in class, work to improve your focus. Regular exercise, adequate sleep, and a healthy diet can all contribute to mental dexterity. You can also use regular meditation to strengthen your focus., You will rarely impress teachers or classmates if you gloat or brag about success. Your math teacher especially may be unhappy if you inadvertently discourage your classmates by using your test scores to show that you are better at math than they are. Acknowledge your success, but encourage your classmates by noticing their success as well.


Avoid trying to attract attention to yourself for being the first finished or for getting the highest grade. There is no need to bring extra attention to yourself. Your teacher will see your success without you gloating. Additionally, overconfidence can hurt your learning.You can speak about your accomplishments, but don’t dominate conversations by talking about them at length., Participation is a good way to impress a math teacher, but make sure that other students have their chance to participate. Only talk in class when it is instructed or allowed. If you worry that you participate too much, keep a mental tally and limit the number of times that you raise your hand to five.

, Common classroom behaviors can upset your teacher because they distract other students and show that you are uninterested in the class. Don’t pass notes or talk to neighboring students. Respect other students by listening while they talk in class.


Avoid using your phone in class. Even if you think you are discrete, your teacher will probably notice.

, If you do not understand part of the assignment or need to clarify a concept from class, try to ask during office hours. Teachers like to address students’ confusion as early as possible. This will also give you a chance to develop your rapport with your teacher.


If they do not have office hours, ask questions as you leave the classroom. Respect the fact that your teacher may have limited time and keep questions brief and specific.

Complete your work.,
Participate in discussions.,
Keep a low profile.,
Be on time.",How to Change a Teacher's Bad Impression of You2," This might sound obvious, but it can be easier said than done. Even a teacher who has decided that they don’t like you will have a hard time keeping that opinion if they see you consistently finishing your work on time.Make sure you complete assignments not just on time, but also thoroughly. For example, if an assignment asks for you to answer in complete sentences, do so. If a math worksheet asks you to show your work, make sure you do.
Ask for whatever help you need. If you have a hard time completing assignments, get help from a parent, friend, or tutor.
If your relationship with your teacher isn’t too terrible, you can ask them for help, too. Say something like, “I know I haven’t been great at finishing my work for this class. I want to improve, but I’m struggling with the subject matter. Would you be willing to offer me a little extra help or answer some questions for me after class?”

, Good teachers will engage students in discussions about the subject matter. Make sure you participate in a polite and engaged way. This usually means raising your hand to speak and listening when others are talking.Participating means staying present in class. Never take out your phone or send texts while in class.
Keep your head up and eyes alert during class discussions.

, Sometimes, a teacher may have gotten a bad impression of you because you act up in class, talk out of turn, or are generally disruptive. If that’s the case, try to keep a lower profile in class. This will show the teacher that you’re not always seeking attention.Make sure to always raise your hand to speak. If you speak a lot in class, maybe try keeping your hand down for a bit to let others talk.
If your teacher has a poor impression of you because you don’t participate much, try the opposite of keeping a low profile. Speak up more and let them know you’re engaged.

, Being on time for class lets teachers know that you value their time and energy. After all, it takes a lot of work for them to come to class, too. If you arrive to class with some extra time, ask if there’s anything you can do to help your teacher setup or prepare for class. They’ll probably be grateful that you offered.If you’re late consistently, write them a note to apologize and explain yourself.
Being on time is a good habit to develop early, as it will benefit you throughout your entire life.

Tell your parents.,
Surround yourself with good friends.,
Visit the guidance counselor.",How to Change a Teacher's Bad Impression of You3," If you feel that your teacher’s bad impression of you is unfair and unlikely to change, you need to tell an adult whom you trust. They may or may not be able to intervene, but it’s important to seek support and have someone on your team.Tell your parents the details of what has gone on, so that they have concrete facts and incidents to consider.
Your parents may choose to have a meeting or phone conversation with your teacher. While this may seem scary or embarrassing, it can help your teacher to understand that you do want the relationship to change and that it’s important to you.

, If you have a strong social network, your teacher will see that. It will also help you to feel more comfortable with yourself, which will likely result in you feeling more comfortable in class. This can help you give a better impression because you’ll be able to act authentically, which is something most teachers appreciate.If the friends they see you with are good students whom the teacher respects, that is likely to help influence your teacher’s impression of you.

, If you don’t feel comfortable talking to your parents, make an appointment with your school’s guidance counselor. The counselor is a person who’s neutral and is there to be on your side. Your meeting with them should be confidential and cannot be held against you in class.The counselor should be able to offer some advice or guidance and may even be willing to facilitate a conversation between you and your teacher.

Tutor your peers.,
Acknowledge your teacher.,
Ask for class recommendations.,
Meet outside of class.,
Get involved.,
Never bully anyone.,
Avoid negative attention.",How to Build a Good Reputation with Teachers2," If there is a subject at which you excel, volunteer to help classmates who are behind in that subject. By helping someone else understand something, you might get a better grasp of it yourself, and you can show your teacher that not only do you know the material, but you care about the success of your peers, as well.Ask your teacher about campus tutoring programs. Many schools offer open peer tutoring sessions once or twice a week to help struggling students.
Consider volunteering to tutor lower grades at different schools, as well. If, for example, you are a high school student, consider after-school volunteer tutoring at the local middle school.

, It’s easy to forget your teacher when you’re not in class, but if you see them around campus, say hello and have a polite conversation. Don’t just extend this courtesy to your teacher, but to your school administrators, facilities staff, and your peers.


Being kind and courteous to others is not only polite, it shows your teacher you care about others on your campus and that you are dedicated to fostering a positive atmosphere at school.

, Ask your teacher for recommendations for other classes that may be a good fit for you. This will not only help you find good courses, it will put you in touch with other teachers that may appreciate you as a student.


When your teacher gives you a recommendation, reach out to the potential teacher either by meeting with them or emailing them. Introduce yourself and ask about what they envision for the class in the coming semester.
Ask your current teacher to introduce you to potential teachers. This gives them a chance to talk about you in a positive matter and build your reputation with other teachers early on.

, If you are having difficulty in class, set up a time to meet with your teacher outside of class and discuss your concerns. Be open and honest with your teacher about where you struggle, and your concerns for your academic future.


Discussing your personal concerns helps your teacher view you individually from your peer. Let them know what you struggle with, and ask them what solutions you can pursue to remedy your fears.
Ask if you can meet regularly and set up meetings once a week or once a month to review your progress and show your teacher your efforts.

, If possible, get involved in extracurricular student groups and activities. Try something you think you’ll enjoy, whether that’s athletics, drama, debate, school newspaper, yearbook, or an academic club such as mathletes. This shows your teacher that you are interested in school activities, and willing to put in time and effort outside of class.If there isn’t a student group or organization that interests you, create one that fits your interests. Look up your school’s rules regarding student organizations and find other interested peers to participate. You may even ask your teacher to be your faculty advisor.
Run for leadership positions within your organization when they become available. This shows that not only are you participating, but that you are proactive and value responsibility.

, No one, especially a teacher, likes bullies. Avoid not only physical violence but harsh words and language regarding your peers, your teacher, or anyone else. If you see someone being bullied, do what you can to stand up for them or involve an authority figure if necessary. This is not only courteous, it shows your teacher that you have respect for your peers.If there is someone you do not get along with at school, try to find healthy ways to cope with your feelings and simply do not engage with them if provoked. Walking away is often your best option in such cases.

, If you have multiple teachers, don’t just focus on getting one to like you. Teachers talk to each other, even if they're in different departments, so behave well in all your classes. Don't end up in the principal's office every day for breaking the rules repeatedly.


You may not be looking to build a great reputation with all of your teachers, but you should be on positive terms with all of them. Treat each of your teachers kindly inside and outside of class.

"
"
Do your homework.,
Research the subject.,
Proofread and edit.",How to Build a Good Reputation with Teachers3," Whether that involves assignments from your book, readings, presentations, or anything else, it is important to do your homework every day. This not only shows your teacher that you are dedicated and paying attention, it also helps you learn the material and do better in class.If there is ever a legitimate reason that you cannot complete your homework, such as a medical emergency, contact your teacher as soon as is reasonably possible to let them know and ask for an extension.
If there is anything in the homework that you don’t understand or want to review, ask your teacher the next day during or right after class.

, Don’t limit yourself to what you are assigned in class. If you find a subject interesting, take some free time to research it on your own. Read additional materials both online and in print, and explore the subject interactively through activities such as experiments, going to museums, or visiting other sites related to the subject. This shows your teacher you are willing to take initiative and that you are an active learner. Ask your teacher for a bibliography of readings regarding the portions of the subject that interest you. This is a great way to get new sources and show your teacher your interest.
Avoid interrupting class with your new information. Demonstrate your knowledge in papers or assignments, but understand that your teacher developed the lesson to cover specific matters and respect their efforts in class.

, When you are working on projects at home, take the time to not only make sure they’re done, but make sure they’re done well. Proofread your assignments and check your work when applicable. Your teacher will take you far less seriously as a student if you frequently turn in sloppy or unedited work.If possible, have a peer review your paper or assignment to ensure that it is done correctly and makes sense.
Use guidelines offered by your teacher or written in your syllabus to make sure your assignments are formatted and edited correctly.

"
"
Complete assignments on time.,
Show your work on homework assignments.,
Work on math during class free time.,
Look ahead.,
Ask for assistance.",How to Be Your Math Teacher's Favorite Student2," When you turn in work late, it creates extra work for a teacher. Teachers appreciate receiving each student’s completed work on time as it allows them to determine what material they need to spend more time on in class.


Remember that math teachers spend significant time and effort determining what homework they assign. You will impress your teacher by showing respect for their judgement., It can be tempting to simply provide the answer if you understand a problem, but it is important to show the process that you used to get your answer. In math, the process used to reach the answer is very important and teachers appreciate when students show that work.


If in doubt, show more than is required. A teacher will not punish a student for showing a lot of work. In fact, their homework might be used as a class example in a class where most kids fail to show work.

, If you are given class time to work on an assignment, start the new assignment or review the old one in class. If you work on other subjects, you can inadvertently signal to your teacher that math is less important to you than other classes. Study for an upcoming test or review previous homework assignments. This will show your teacher that you are interested in the subject that they have dedicated much of their life to teaching.


You can ask for additional problems if you are enjoying the work. The teacher may be able to give you more challenging problems that will help you understand the material more fully.

, You do not need to teach yourself a topic or concept in advance. If you have a rough idea of the lesson ahead, you will be able to engage the material while your classmates are confused. If your textbook came with supplemental materials, use them.


At home, you can go online and explore multiple sites dedicated to helping you learn math. Keep in mind that different sites will be directed at different age levels and math topics. Ask your teacher if they recommend any particular sites or search for materials by entering the subject and level that you want to explore into a search engine., It can be tempting to try to impress a teacher by never asking for help. Rather than cast a false image of already being an expert, allow your teacher and classmates to help you with specific question. Not only will this help you learn more, it will show your teacher the degree of your dedication.

"
"
Thank your teacher.,
Volunteer in the classroom.,
Have your parents thank your teacher.,
Compliment your teacher.,
Explore the uses of math in other subjects.",How to Be Your Math Teacher's Favorite Student3," The challenge of being a student can dominate your attention, but your teacher works hard as well. Make sure to tell your teacher that you appreciate their work periodically. If they go to extra lengths to help you, acknowledge their extra effort appreciatively.


Your teacher does many things that you may take for granted. Look for times that you could tell them one of the following: “You really helped me understand that challenging idea, thank you.” “Today’s class was fun, thank you for making it easy to stay focused on the material.” “Your excitement for the subject is contagious!”

, Offer to help if desks need to be moved, or if the chalkboard needs to be cleaned. Teacher’s often juggle many responsibilities and they will appreciate small efforts to make their day easier. This is a good way to show your appreciation for the person who teaches you., Encourage your parents to attend parent teacher conferences. While these conferences are primarily about your progress, they provide an opportunity for your parents to acknowledge your teacher’s hard work. Your teacher will likely appreciate the gesture.

, Note something unique about your teacher that is not related to math. Compliment their classroom decorations, or something they have done for the school. This will show your teacher that they are appreciated beyond their teaching.


Appropriate compliments will come naturally once you think about them. Consider statements like: “I really like that art print you hung on the wall,” “It’s so clear that you care about our success,” “I like that you hang your child’s artwork, they are really talented,” or “You are such an important part of the school, you make each day better for so many students.”

, It can be difficult for some students to express an interest in math since it can be very abstract. If you have trouble finding math interesting, explore how it relates to other subjects and professions. You will find it easier to connect meaningfully with your teacher if you find overlapping interests.If you want to study business, ask: “What do you think is the most important math to learn for finance?” If you are interested in sociology, ask: “What do you think are the limits of statistics for understanding human interactions?” If you are interested criminal investigations, you can ask: “How is math used in forensic sciences?”

"
Try to help in the flow of the class.,
If you meet teachers a lot during school hours, or on the streets, grab the opportunity.,
It's the small things that get noticed.,
Perfect your small but considerate gestures.,
Be over-polite.,
There might be problems in your friend group if you start being ""friendly"" to teachers.",How to Be Popular With Teachers," If you ever have to stand at the head of the class and lecture a group of people you didn't know who are inclined to be hostile towards you, you'd see why it's supremely annoying to have the class disrupted; not many people can put up with it. Agreed, it's also meaningless to act like a nodding vegetable throughout class, but whatever you do, always think that you're secretly betting your money against the other students on this teacher to perform well.;
, Smile, go up to them, greet them, talk about the weather, ask them if they're fine, and maybe throw in some question about when some test is going to be held. But remember! Pick questions only according to how much s/he knows you, how much time s/he has, and whether s/he's the type who thinks it affronting for a student to talk on a level with a teacher. If you don't do any of these, effectively hide yourself; in other words, never give the impression that you're avoiding the person. No one likes feeling that, yes, not even the grumpy gloomy teachers - and in general, the more malicious someone is, irrespective of the age, s/he craves for greater attention.

, If your school has particularly foul-tempered librarian, she could be calmed if someone offered her a chewing gum or asked about her daughter. Make sure the teacher has sufficient supply of stationery, like chalks in class. Offer to carry the stack of copies or bags that s/he's evidently laboring under. Offer to distribute or collect the sheets (unless you think s/he wants to do it her/himself for some reason, maybe to check everyone's desk,etc). Add him/her on any networking sites s/he's on (if you dare). If you know the teacher in person, ask about his/her family at Christmas (warning: don't do this more than once or twice a year).

, When you get up, push your chair back in. If everyone else in the class has gone rushing out, leaving the chairs awry, bring a general order to them too, at least allowing passage between desks. There's nothing a teacher likes to see better than a considerate student - and this way, you'd be helping out the cleaners too! Pick up the dry rubbish from the classroom or grounds and throw them into nearby dustbins. Also - and this is vitally important - do not call teachers names, even among your friends, unless you know they wouldn't mind. Even you wouldn't like being called a ""mentally-affected *beep* *beep* *beep*"" behind your back. If it is so tempting, try to come up with witty and creative names, not crudely offensive ones.

, This is another vital step - be very polite, but avoid sarcasm. Do not lose your temper with the teachers. Whatever they say, say ""thank you"" or ""sorry"". If you have an argument or excuse, try putting it forward once, but if the teacher isn't so intent on listening, drop it. This might seem like selling yourself out, but it's not - it's basically avoiding conflict in a system where you'll probably always be victimized in a teacher-student conflict. Also, this is a basic fact for all humans - if you do not argue, you do not send the other person into a self-defensive mode where they can say ""I was right in turning him/her out of the class."" You wouldn't enjoy butchering a little kitten into pieces if it just stares quietly, would you? But if it puts up a fight, hurts you, you can justify to others and yourself, ""See? I had to get rid of that monster, it was dangerous."" If you don't argue, remorse is bound to hit the teacher sooner or later. Some would go as far as to apologize or avoid your gaze, the rest would almost definitely let you off the next time for any offense. Any time the teacher thinks s/he's winning some battle against you, don't be verbal - just smile at them, and greet them as politely as you can - make full use of point 2, as there's nothing you've got to lose now. Just hold on and do it even if you hate the teacher - as long as you're in the school and in the system, its suicidal to get into conflict.

, In such cases, it'd be best to start off and go slowly. If you start getting popular among teachers gradually, your friends would also probably want part of the glory and follow suit. Never, ever turn back on them or criticize their ways regarding this. Moreover, only get ""friendly"" to teachers, don't try to become the ""teacher's pet"" - that sort of student who is dying to answer every question, who slobbers through class sitting in the first bench and melts if the teacher asks him/her to do something. That kind is detested by students and sensible teachers alike. Teachers hardly ever look on these pets as humans, but academically brilliant sycophants. Do NOT sell yourself out, try to establish a relation that goes beyond academics and class, a relation between the human that is you and the human that is the teacher. In the class, your fellow students should always be your first priority - never act detached from them to be closer to the teacher!

Double-check your course’s policies.,
Show evidence if you say you are sick.,
Be honest about personal emergencies.,
Let your professor know if you are swamped with work.,
Go the strength in numbers route.,
Keep it simple.,
Ask as soon as possible.,
Approach your professor in-person.,
Email to ask your professor about an extension.,
Decide how long the extension will be.",How to Ask a Professor for a Paper Extension," Before you actually ask your professor, read over the class syllabus and any other course policies. Sometimes professors will say if they automatically grant extensions, are willing to consider them in certain circumstances, or have a no-extension policy.Knowing what your professor’s rules are, and what they’re willing to do, will help you phrase your request correctly.;
, A serious illness, like the flu, is a reasonable cause to ask for an extension. If you say you are sick, however, expect some professors to ask for a doctor’s note or other evidence.If you say you are sick, most professors will understand. You don’t have to go into great detail about your intestinal difficulties or any other problem. Most professors won’t want to hear about this.
Something simple will do the trick, like: “Professor Thompson, I came down with a bad flu over the weekend and need a little more time to work on my paper. Could I possibly have an extension? I’d be happy to show you documentation from the University Health Services if you need to see it.”

, If there is a death or grave illness in the family, or some other unexpected hardship, this is a good reason to ask for a paper extension. Many professors would be willing to grant extensions in genuine cases of personal emergencies, but don’t abuse this possibility.

Try something like ""Dear Professor Thompson, I'm sorry to say that last night my great Aunt Maude passed away. I'm with my family right now and will be attending the funeral. I was planning on completing my paper for your class tomorrow, but given the circumstances, could I ask for a two-day extension?""
A professor may or may not ask for some kind of documentation of the emergency, so don’t go this route if you’re unable to back up your story.

, Professors understand that you may be taking several classes at once, and have other things going on in your life as well. Sometimes you need an extension because you are overloaded. It’s worth trying to ask for one if this is the case.Stress that you need this kind of extension to write a good paper, e.g. “I’m requesting an extension because I’m overloaded with three exams all taking place on the day the paper is due. I want to do well on this paper and give it the attention it deserves, and another day or two would really help.”

, A group of students could collectively ask a professor for an extension if they all have an exam or other commitment that is taking away from time they need to spend on a paper. If several people all ask a professor for an extension, it can be more convincing than asking on your own.Say something like “Professor Thompson, 7 of us in your class are also enrolled in CHEM 220, and we have an exam on the same day the paper is due. Could we have a one-day extension so we can have enough time to write strong papers?”

, Whatever your reason for asking for an extension, don’t wear your professor down with endless explanations. Just get straight to the point, ask why you need an extension, and thank your professor for considering.If you need an extension because you caused yourself to get behind in your schoolwork, accept responsibility and ask for the extension anyway. Most professors will appreciate the honesty.

, Professors are much more likely to grant an extension if you ask before the paper is due. Ask as soon as you think you might need one, rather than the night before the deadline, or afterwards., Talking one-on-one with your professor will help show them you are being honest in saying you need an extension. When you think you need an extension, visit the professor during office hours or at least ask to talk to them for a minute after class., If you’re sick, away, or it’s the weekend you might not be able to approach your professor in person. In that case, plan to write a polite email to ask for more time to write the paper.

, An extension should give you a reasonable amount of time to complete the paper, based on how long you’ve already had to work on it, and on how much you’ve finished. Think about your professor’s personality when deciding how long of an extension to ask for.If your professor seems strict, leave it entirely up to them to decide how long of an extension to grant. You may just have to take what you can get.
If your professor is more lenient, and you think you can get the paper done within a certain time (such as two more days), ask for a specific extension.
If your professor seems like the type to negotiate, aim high. If you think you can get the paper done in two days, ask for a four day extension at first, and expect your professor to negotiate down.

Be prepared.,
Participate in lessons.,
Work on your assignments when instructed.,
Do your homework.,
Follow directions.Whenever the teacher asks you to do something specific, be sure to follow their directions exactly.,
Avoid distracting other students.",How to Be Nice to Teachers1," Try to be prepared for every lesson so that you can follow along easily. Make sure you have the right supplies, books and completed assignments for each lesson. When you go into class, be ready to learn. When you're doing your homework the night before, write down any questions you have about it.


Make sure to ask your teacher those questions the next day.
This will show your teacher that learning is important to you.;
, Try not to drift off or get distracted. If the teacher asks the class a question and you know the answer, raise your hand. Get involved in group discussions whenever you can. When you do join in, never talk over a classmate or interrupt your teacher. If you aren’t sure how to join a class discussion, ask a question.You could say something like, “Mrs. Bell, can we talk more about the main character’s motivations in the book?”You could also say something like, “Mr. Turner, can we please go through that equation one more time? I’m not sure I understand the last part of it.”

, When the teacher gives in-class assignments, always do them when you’re supposed to.Work during the work period provided so that you can finish your assignments on time. Try not to distract anyone nearby who’s also working on their assignments.


If you have a question about something on the assignment, raise your hand and ask the teacher politely for help.Then say something like, “Ms. Miller, I’m not sure if I understand this part of the assignment. Can you explain it?”
After the teacher helps you, always say “thank you.”, Always doing your homework is a way to show your teacher that you care about the class and what you're learning. Teachers work long hours teaching kids all day, so when students don’t do their homework or complete assignments, they feel ignored. Teachers, like everyone, want to feel that what they do matters. When students show that they are learning things, it makes their teachers happy. Doing your homework is one of the easiest ways to be nice to your teacher!
If you’ve been out sick and missed class, always ask your teacher what you missed. Be sure to get your makeup assignments and homework.

, Do your assignments the way the teacher told you to. Whenever your teacher verbally asks you to do something, always do it without making a fuss.


Never do anything disrespectful, like make a face or roll your eyes, when the teacher asks you to do something.
If you don’t understand the directions given, don’t be afraid to raise your hand and ask a question or for assistance.

, Never make excessive noise or talk to your classmates during a lesson. Don't shuffle papers around loudly, dig noisily in your back pack or slam books around. This will interrupt your classmates’ concentration and your teacher. If you can’t pay attention when you sit by your friends, try sitting elsewhere. You can save small talk with your friends for after class.


If you have assigned seats, go to your teacher privately after class and ask to be moved.
Let them know you'd like to be moved so that you can concentrate on lessons better. Your teacher will appreciate that you are taking an active role in your education.

Be helpful whenever you can.,
Raise your hand before speaking.Never interrupt your teacher or speak out of turn.,
Follow the classroom rules.Most teachers make their classroom rules very clear on the first day of class, so you should be familiar with them.",How to Be Nice to Teachers2," Teachers expect you to be on time to class. Everyone is late occasionally, but making a habit of being late will definitely upset your teacher. It makes them feel like you don’t care about the class and don’t respect their time. On the occasions when you are late, apologize to your teacher sincerely and come into class as quietly as possible.


Don’t interrupt the teacher in the middle of a lesson by bursting in late and making a lot of noise.
This distracts the other students and will no doubt irritate the teacher, as well. It is an open display of disrespect.

, Greet your teacher with a smile whenever you see them. Say “please” and “thank you” whenever you interact with them. Refer to them as “ma’am” or “sir” when appropriate. When you use their last name, always say the proper “Ms.” “Mrs.” or “Mr.” in front of it. Never raise your voice at your teacher when you’re upset. Speak in a calm voice and use proper grammar.


For example, “Yes sir, Mr. Smith, I did my homework.” Another example, “May I please go to the restroom, Ms. Roberts? Thank you.”
Don’t use slang or speak roughly. Never laugh at or make fun of your teachers.
Be sincere. Avoid trying to be the teacher’s pet or acting artificially towards them. Teachers usually see through that act quickly., Raise your hand, ask questions and try to learn the material as best as you can. When appropriate, take notes during class. Taking notes will help you stay focused. When homework is assigned, write it down. Avoid putting your head down on your desk, writing notes to your friends or drifting off. Give the teacher your full attention.


If you have a cell phone or tablet with you, don’t take it out and use it during a lesson.It’s best to keep electronic devices put away during class. When you have them out, it can be very tempting to use them.

, This can be as simple as holding the door open for your teacher when they have their hands full or helping them pick up objects that have been knocked over. Offer to pass out worksheets to the class or pick up everyone's tests.


If your teacher needs a quick errand done, such as making more copies of an assignment, offer to do it.
Being helpful in little ways is a great way to be nice to your teachers.

, If you have a question or something to say, always raise your hand and wait until your teacher addresses you. Raising your hand and then blurting something out without waiting for your teacher’s acknowledgement is just as bad as not raising your hand at all.


Avoid asking your teacher silly or pointless questions when you raise your hand. If you have something to say, be succinct – try not to waste any class time.If you have a question that’s not related to the lesson, try to wait until the end of class to ask.

, If you need a refresher, look for the handout you were given at the beginning of the year. Make sure you follow these rules exactly.If you see one of your friends breaking a rule in class, try to get them to stop.
Do whatever you can to help your fellow classmates follow the rules, too.

Ask former students about their experience.,
Be on time for class.,
Avoid behaviors that upset the teacher.,
Sit away from known troublemakers.",How to Avoid Being a Victim of an Unfair Teacher1," Students who have interacted with this teacher before may be able to offer insight into the teacher's personality that could help you better navigate the class. They may also be able to offer coping strategies. Be wary of the advice of students who have a bad reputation with most of their teachers.
Try and find out the types of things the teacher respects in a student.;
, Showing up late can really get on a teacher's nerves. If they have to stop teaching to wait for you to take your seat and settle in they may be tempted to make an example out of you. Try to aim for getting to class at least ten minutes early so you can find a seat and be ready with your notebook or laptop out when class officially begins.

, Some teachers might come out and tell you what some of their pet peeves are, but others you’ll have to be on the lookout for. If you see another student get scolded for something, take note and avoid that behavior if you can. Don’t talk socially with friends during class.
Keep your cellphone on silent and tucked away in your book bag.
Don’t eat food during class.

, Try and find a seat in class that is near the middle but away from students you know tend to act out or do other things that draw the teachers attention. You'll avoid being lumped together with excessive talkers or chronic sleepers if you steer clear of sitting near them altogether.

Try problem-solving first.,
Be brave.,
Get your teacher’s attention the right way.,
Tell your teacher what you need help with.Teachers know a lot of things, and sometimes seem like they can read your mind.,
Don’t ask your teacher for the answers.,
Listen to the response.It doesn’t do any good to ask a teacher for help if you aren’t going to really listen to their answer.",How to Ask a Teacher for Help1," When possible, try to figure out the solution to your problem on your own before you ask your teacher for help. Teachers like it when students try to problem solve before asking for help.It shows independence.


Try to use your resources. For example, see if the answer to your question is in your textbook or notes.
Some teachers tell students to “phone a friend” or ask another student for help before asking the teacher.;
, A lot of times people won’t ask for help because they are afraid they will look stupid or embarrass themselves.The truth is, not asking for help is usually worse because you don’t get the help you need. If you’ve tried to problem solve, but still need help, then be brave and ask your teacher.


Take a deep breath and remind yourself that asking your teacher for help is a mature thing to do.
Say to yourself, “Asking for help means I’m mature. It’s what I should do when I don’t understand.”
You can also remind yourself, “There’s probably someone else that has the same question, but is afraid to ask. So I’ll be brave and ask.”

, Yelling “I need help” or just blurting out your question while your teacher is talking is not the best way to get your teacher’s attention. Your teacher has probably let you know how you should get their attention when you need help.


Raise your hand or use the signal your teacher taught you for getting their attention.
For example, your teacher might have taught you to hold up an American Sign Language ‘a’ to silently signal that you want to ask a question.
Sometimes you may need to approach your teacher to get their attention. If you do, politely say “Excuse me.”
For example, your Math teacher is at his desk looking over papers and doesn’t see your raised hand. You could walk up and say, “Excuse me, Mr. Jenkins.”

, But, it will be a lot easier for you to ask for help, and get the help you need from your teacher, if you let them know exactly what you need help with.You can start by saying something like, “Mr. Golden, could you help me with the fourth discussion question?”
Then you can be more specific. For example, “I don’t understand what the second part of the question is asking.”

, That doesn’t help you learn and most teachers won’t just give you the answer anyway. Instead, ask your teacher for help finding the answer or remembering the steps to find the answer.


This will help you figure out similar questions and show your teacher that you want to be a good problem-solver.
For example, instead of asking, “What’s the main topic of this passage?” You could ask, “How do I find the main topic of a passage?”
Or you might say, ""How do I multiple two-digit numbers?"" instead of, ""What is 30 times 15?""

, Paying attention to your teacher’s answer will get you the help you need with your schoolwork. It will also show your teacher respect which will encourage them to help you next time you ask.


Don’t get inpatient if their answer turns into a mini-lesson. Your teacher is just trying to help you and make sure you understand.
Their answer to your question might answer another question you have or teach you something else.
Ask more questions if you don’t understand. For example, you could say, “And how do I know if it’s a right angle?”

Participate in class.,
Be inquisitive.,
Offer to help with classroom tasks.,
Join extracurricular activities your teacher leads.",How to Be Best Friends With Your Teacher1," It’s your teacher’s job to make sure you begin to understand the world around you. Your social and academic education is a long process, and all of your teachers play an important role in providing a basis of knowledge that you’ll continue to expand upon for the rest of your life. In order to learn anything, let alone befriend any of your teachers, you need to participate in their classes!Pay attention during class, and always put forth a serious effort to understand what your teacher is sharing with the class.
At the very least, come to school prepared to learn, with the books and writing utensils you need for each class, and your homework assignments complete. Never skip class!;
, If what your teacher is saying doesn’t make sense, ask questions about anything that is unclear. Believe it or not, teachers usually like when students ask questions. Your curiosity indicates you’ve been listening, and that you’re ready and willing to learn. Further, your questions will help other students better understand the content as well.Feel free to ask questions that expand upon the content in class. For instance, after a lecture about what stars are made of, ask something like ""Why is it that some stars in our sky are brighter than others?""
Catch your teacher after class to ask for personal insight. Say something like, ""Miss Markey, I've really been enjoying the section we've been studying on the night sky. Do you have a favorite place to look at the stars?""

, If you have a favorite teacher that you want to get the chance to speak with more often, ask how you can be more involved in the classes you have together. Tasks you may be able to help with are dependent on the classes you’re taking. For instance, if your teacher teaches science, offer to come to class a few minutes early to help setup the experiments for that day.This will allow you to get to know your favorite teacher better. You’ll also likely wind up learning more about the subjects they teach, and may find that you share some of your teacher’s interests.
It’s alright if you don’t have any ideas about how to be more involved in. Ask your teacher how you can contribute by saying something like, ""Is there any way I can dive deeper into this material with you? I'd be happy to help set up for our next class!""

, You may have one or two teachers that you especially admire. If a teacher you favor coaches an athletic team or advises a club at school, consider joining. In the classroom, conversation should focus mostly on the content that is being taught. Extracurricular activities offer a great way to learn from your teacher about things other than academic subjects.


Outside of the classroom, you and your teacher will get the chance to talk more about other things that are important. These conversations may even prove to be equally important as the discussions held during class.
For instance, these conversations might touch on facing challenges and finding creative solutions to address them, or working hard to achieve personal goals.
Ask general questions as well as specific ones. Ask something like ""How can I make my drawing look more realistic?"" or ""Have you ever tried to learn something that was really hard at first? How did you get better?""

Learn the classroom rules and expectations.,
Look attentive.,
Study for quizzes and tests.,
Participate a moderate amount.",How to Avoid Being a Victim of an Unfair Teacher2," Many teachers make their expectations clear at the beginning of the semester. Learning these quickly and adhering to them will give the teacher fewer reasons to pick on you. Keep a copy of the syllabus with you during class as a reference.
Be sure to follow any special formatting rules they may have for homework assignments.

, Teachers want students to listen to their lessons. Looking interested and engaged shows them that you take your learning seriously.


Sit up straight at your desk.
Look up from your notebook to show you are paying attention.

, Make sure you are setting aside enough time to prepare for exams in the teacher's class. Maintaining a good grade in the class will show the teacher you are invested.

, Make sure you are raising your hand and answering questions a couple of times per class to show you are interested. Don’t over do it. Some teachers can be just as put off by the teacher's pet as they can a slacker student.

Stay cool.,
Let little things slide.,
Try to see things from their point of view.",How to Avoid Being a Victim of an Unfair Teacher3," It’s easy to lose your temper if you feel like you are being treated unfairly by a teacher. Before you react, take a deep breathe and count to ten. Try and give yourself enough time to weigh the situation in your mind and to calm your nerves. Lashing out at an unfair teacher will usually just get you in more trouble. Stay calm and react mindfully. , Pick your battles. Don’t let minor annoyances with the teacher get angry responses out of you. Things like a rude tone of voice can be hurtful, but might not be worth escalating into a bigger issue. , Teachers are just people. They may be having a bad day or dealing with particularly difficult person problems. Ask yourself what might be going on in the teacher's life that would cause them to act this way. Are they really angry because you forgot to put your name on your assignment, or are they frustrated because their car got a flat tire and they were late to work that morning?"
"
Keep a list of the teacher's actions and words.,
Tell your parents you are having trouble with your teacher.,
Ask the teacher what you can do to be more successful in their class.This puts the responsibility back on them.,
Talk to a school counselor or administrator.,
Confront the teacher.",How to Avoid Being a Victim of an Unfair Teacher4," You'll want to make sure you are documenting anything that concerns you about the teachers behavior or classroom policies so that you have an accurate account you can present to an outside party if need be. Don't just rely on memory. Write down dates, specific incidents, parties involved etc. Be thorough.

, Hopefully, your parents will be able to reassure you and help you come up with a plan to solve the problem on your own. If not your parents may need to set up a meeting with the teacher.Make sure your parents don’t go into the meeting angry.
You and your parents can decide if you need to be present for this meeting.
Ask your parents to call up a classmate’s parents to see if they are having similar trouble with the teacher.

, Some difficult teachers are trying to gain authority over the class. Asking them for advice shows that you see them as a respected authority figure.""What types of things do you look for when grading homework assignments?""
""I'm really enjoying your class, I just want to make sure I'm getting the most out of it.""
See if they offer extra credit opportunities.
Ask if they have suggestions for the best way to study for an upcoming test.
""Are there any supplemental texts you would suggest I take a look at to further my understanding of some of the material?""

, If you continue to feel unfairly treated by your teacher then you should take your concerns higher up. Ask for a meeting with the vice principle or Dean.Try to separate the person from the issue. Don’t say I’m having trouble with Mr. A. Say you are having trouble in Mr. A’s class.
Avoid using derogatory language about the teacher.
Write a list of your concerns before the meeting.
Express your concerns in a clear and calm voice.

, Before you take the problem to an outside source, see if you can work it out one on one with the teacher. It is possible they aren’t aware you feel treated unfairly.


Choose an appropriate time to talk with your teacher. Either after class or at the beginning or end of the school day.
Don’t be aggressive or rude.
Tell them how you feel. ""I'm sure it's not intentional, but sometimes I feel singled out in class in a way that makes me uncomfortable.""
Be open minded to the teacher’s point of view. ""I understand you have reasons for the way you do things.""
If you find yourself getting upset, walk away until you have calmed down. ""Do you mind if we take a break from our conversation? I'm feeling very overwhelmed and I need a minute to gather my thoughts.""

Get your school supplies before the school year starts.,
Put your school supplies in a container that is used only for them.,
Keep your personal area clean.,
Keep track of your homework and assignments.",How to Get Organized for School1," Be sure to get the supplies your teacher suggests. Your teacher may have sent you a list of supplies that you will need for the year before your classes begin. If he or she did, then you should remind your parents to help you get them all before the start of the school year. This will guarantee that you have the right supplies when they are needed in class or for an assignment.


You may also need a new backpack and a new lunchbox for the year. In addition, getting some new school clothes before the start of the year is also usually a good idea.
You don't have to spend a lot of money. There are many 99-cent stores that sell inexpensive school supplies. If your family cannot afford to buy school supplies at all, there are some charities that may be able to supply them to you.;
, Once you get all of your supplies, it's important to keep them organized in a container. This could be a pencil pouch or a pocket on your backpack. Whatever the container, this simply is a good way to keep them separate and organized.You may want to have two separate containers for your supplies. One can hold the things you use every day and the other can hold the things that you rarely use.
Using a container that is specifically made for holding school supplies may work best, as it was made in the right shape to accommodate your supplies.

, If you have a desk with your own drawer, don't just shove stuff in there. Instead, stack your materials neatly. This will keep your papers and supplies in good shape and it will help you to easily find everything you need for class.


This is also a good idea for your backpack and your space at home. If you cram everything into your backpack and don't clean it out regularly, you can end up damaging your supplies and losing important papers.
In order to keep your area clean, make sure everything has a specific place that it goes. If your items have a place, it will make putting your stuff away more straight forward.
If you have a hard time keeping your area clean, try using some organizational trays to keep odd shaped and small items separate and out of the way.

, Even in elementary school you will have assignments that you need to turn in on time. Your teacher will tell you when they are due and it is your job to get them in on time. This might require you to have a calendar of assignments, so that you know when one is coming up, and that you bring home the materials you need to complete an assignment.


When you get an assignment, write the due date down in your calendar right away. In order to do this, however, you need to bring your calendar with you to school every day.
If you have a hard time keeping track of assignments, ask your parents to help you keep track of them and when they are due. This could involve them reminding you ahead of time about an assignment, so that you have time to compete it.
When you are heading home for the day remember to think about what homework you have to do that evening. Homework usually requires you to bring home materials, such as worksheets, so if you are organized you will remember to bring them home with you.

If you’re afraid to approach your teacher, put a note on their chair. The note could say, “Can we talk later about something personal? Thanks, Mark.”
You could also send your teacher an email or message letting them know you would like to ask their help with a personal issue.

, Sometimes teachers will try to offer advice on what you should do, when all you wanted was for them to listen. If you let your teacher know how they can help, it will make it easier for them to give you the help you want and need.Think about what kind of help you want. Ask yourself, “Do I want her to listen, to give me advice, or to do something about the problem?”

, Also, being honest will help your teacher figure out the right way to help you.


The more truthful information your teacher has about what is going on, the more they will be able to help.
If you are afraid you will get in trouble, then say that. You could say, “I need your help with something but I’m scared I’ll get in trouble.”
If you are asking for help, but also trying not to get someone else in trouble, you could leave out names, but still be honest about what is going on.
For example, “My friend is thinking about cheating on a test and I need advice on how to stop them from doing something so stupid.”

, Asking a teacher for help early on may prevent the issue from getting any bigger.It also gives the teacher the opportunity to be proactive and stop problems at home from impacting schoolwork so much.


Don’t wait until report cards or progress reports come home.

Be positive and polite.,
Ask questions outside of class.,
Find out what they’re interested in.,
Thank your teacher.",How to Be Best Friends With Your Teacher2," An esteemed and much-loved author once said, “Babies, be kind.” Believe it or not, he was talking to adults, but the advice holds for kids of any age. Perhaps the best way to initiate a friendship with someone is simply being polite!If you each have a moment when you pass one another in the hallway, stop to chat. Ask something like ""What's the next thing you're looking forward to?"" You may even learn something new and interesting about your teacher.
You can keep it simple too. A quick “see you tomorrow” on the way out of class lets your teacher know you’re glad to be in their class – and that alone is significant.

, In the most literal sense, ""getting along"" doesn’t mean much more than communicating in a way that both you and your teacher enjoy. Good communication is based on clearly sharing one’s thoughts and needs with one another, and listening enough to understand what the other is saying.Don’t hesitate to ask your teacher questions about life outside of the material you’re learning in the classroom.
For instance, if you’ve been wondering about how to approach a certain issue with one of your friends, say something like “Can I ask you about something that’s not related to class?” Your teacher will likely be happy to talk to you about whatever.

, One of the best ways to enrich your relationship with another human being is by learning more about them. The best way to do this is to ask! For instance, ask your teacher questions like “Why did you decide to become a teacher?” or “What do you like most about teaching?”Not only do these sorts of questions lead to quality conversations, you’ll also come to recognize the sorts of things and ideas that your teacher values.

, At the conclusion of a course, thank your teacher by saying something like, “Thanks for teaching us this year. I appreciate your willingness to learn and grow with us.” This pertains to both the teachers you became friends with, and those you don’t. Chances are, you will likely think of some of your teachers years after you took their classes.It may be easier to convey your gratitude in a letter. Remember that your teacher will likely be happy to hear your appreciation. Include an illustration if you're feeling creative - it may even end up on the wall of your teacher's office.
In the future, whenever you’re back in town, make a point of visiting old teachers. They will immensely appreciate this gesture, as it indicates that you value the impact they made on your life.

Imagine yourself becoming a teacher.,
Don’t worry if your teacher corrects you.,
Address any issues.,
Keep it professional.,
Respect boundaries.",How to Be Best Friends With Your Teacher3," It’s totally alright if you have no intentions of being a teacher when you grow up. Either way, picture yourself as a teacher. Remind yourself that your teacher chose to make a career of sharing new ideas and information with kids like you. Chances are, watching you learn is deeply rewarding for them. Ask yourself: If you were a teacher, what sort of relationship would you want with your students?

, Remind yourself that your teacher has a job to do. If they take that job seriously, that means they’ll need to correct and even discipline you and other students from time to time. For instance, if you make an error in class and your teacher points it out, don’t let it bother you. It’s not an attack on you personally, they’re simply teaching you by pointing out something that is incorrect.Similarly, if you’re caught passing a note or otherwise not paying attention, don’t overreact. Your teacher is not attacking you, they are simply bringing your attention back to the classroom.
Apologize after class and know that your teacher will forgive you.

, If it feels like you and a teacher don’t get along, stay calm. Sometimes, personalities clash. Simply fulfill your responsibilities as a student and don’t worry too much about a teacher that is unfriendly. If a teacher is aggressively mean or rude to you in any way, tell both your parents and/or a guidance counselor. If you feel the need to do so, request a meeting with the teacher and another adult. This can be helpful to discuss any potential problems and create a more comfortable atmosphere for both you and your teacher.

, Think of your relationship with your teacher as your first “professional” relationship. For the rest of your life, you’ll need to be able to interact with other people, and you won’t necessarily enjoy everyone you interact with. Understand that you don’t need to be friends with someone to have a healthy relationship with them. Focus on paying attention in class and behaving, and your teacher will likely recognize your efforts., You may find yourself getting along particularly well with one of your teachers. Recognize that their position as a teacher, and yours as a student, requires that certain types of relationships are illegal. More specifically, you cannot become romantically involved with your teacher. Ethics and morality aside, a romantic relationship places your teacher's career at risk, and may even result in criminal proceedings.Do not attempt to flirt with your teacher. This places them in an uncomfortable position, and is disrespectful to them and your other classmates.
If a teacher makes romantic comments towards you, politely point out that you are their student. If you are in any way uncomfortable with what a teacher says to you, tell your parents as well as a another school employee.

Decide what kind of notebook you want to buy.,
Get a folder for each class.,
Buy your other school supplies.,
Keep your personal area clean and organized.,
Keep track of assignments and due dates.,
Bring the correct supplies to school and home.,
Don't procrastinate on assignments.,
Have a designated space to do your homework.,
Make up any missed time.",How to Get Organized for School2," This is a very important decision. Some people prefer spiral notebooks, as it will keep all of your notes in one place, while others prefer a three-ring binder that they can open and close. The choice is up to you and should be based on which one you think will keep you most organized.


A three-ring binder has the benefit that you can open it, put paper in, and take your paper out. This can be helpful if your teacher asks to see your work. However, it can take up a lot of room if you buy a big one.Organize your three-ring binder if you buy one. Get tab dividers and create a tab for each one of your classes: science, math, social studies, reading, writing, and any other classes you attend. This way, you will have your notes and work from each class in a separate place.

, In each class, you may get a lot of ""hand-outs,"" or xeroxed papers. You need to keep these papers organized. If you get a folder for each class, and label each folder with the class name, then you can easily keep your loose papers organized.Bring the folders with you to class. If you get a handout, put it into the folder immediately after you are done looking at it in class.
If you scared of the papers falling out of a folder, pocket files that close completely are a nice substitute.
Clean out your folders once a week. Take out old handouts and make room for new handouts.
Some spiral notebooks come with pockets between sections. These can function well for keeping loose papers organized. If you have a spiral notebook with pockets, be sure to use a specific pocket for each class, and don't just stash your handouts in a random pocket.

, These may include: pencils, pens, a ruler, and paper, among many other things. You may also need to get a new backpack or school bag at the beginning of the school year.If you have separate classes with separate teachers, you may be able to use some of the same supplies for several classes. Look at the supply lists given to you by all of your teachers and compare what each requires. If there is overlap in general supplies, such as pencils, then you can probably use them for multiple classes.
If a teacher says you will need a certain supply for their class, get it. Having the right supplies will help you to succeed in a given class.

, If you have a locker, make sure all of its contents are neatly organized. This way you can easily find the folders and textbooks that you need when you need them.


You may need to share a locker with another student. They may not be as tidy as you are, so you will need to negotiate with them about what space is yours and what space is theirs, so that you can keep your section neat at least.
To keep your locker organized, decide where all of your stuff should ideally go. There should be a shelf for books, a hook for your jacket and bag, and an area for other items you need, such as a spare brush or gym clothes. If you have planned out where things go, its easier to keep your stuff organized.
If you have a hard time keeping your area clean on a day-to-day basis, then pick a day each week to spend a few minutes cleaning up your space. Put things in their right place and clean out garbage and items that need to go home. Friday is a great day to do this, so that you can start Monday morning with a clean start.

, This is a very important part of being organized for class. In order to be successful in class, you need to know when to start an assignment and when it needs to be turned in. There are few feelings that are worse than going into class and realizing that you forgot to do an assignment that is due.This is most easily done by using a planner, either on paper or electronically. At the beginning of the term, write the important due dates into your planner. That way, for any given day or week, you will know what to get done.
Write down due dates right when you find them out. This includes when a teacher changes the due date of an assignment they have already assigned. This will help you avoid forgetting about an important date. However, this requires you to keep your calendar with you every day at school, so that you can keep it up to date.
Try color coding your assignments in your planner so that you know which assignments are for which class. Pick a different color of highlighter for each class so that you can see what assignments are for each of your classes.

, If you are organized enough to know what is due, you should be able to figure out what supplies you need to complete those assignments. This includes both what you need to bring home to do your homework and what you need to have in class so that you can complete assignments there.


When you write due dates in your planner, try adding a short list of what you will need to have at home to finish that assignment. This will make having the right supplies easier.
Your teacher will tell you what to bring to class. This may change from day to day or it may be the same for every class period.
Bringing heavy textbooks home can be a hassle. What is more of a hassle, however, is not having what you need to finish your assignment on time.

, Organizing your time is an important part of being organized for school. This means getting your assignments done when you are supposed to, instead of late or not at all.


If you have a daily or weekly planner, set aside time to do your assignments. This is especially important for more long term projects, as they will take more time and cannot be easily done at the very last moment.Make sure that you do your homework as soon as you get home. Otherwise you are bound to get distracted or talk yourself out of it.

, When you sit there, don't do anything else. Just focus on the homework or projects you need to do. Keeping the space solely for your school work will help you to focus on your work when you are supposed to.


When you do your homework, make sure you do it in a quiet place with little distractions. It's best to avoid working where people are talking loudly, in front of the TV, or in any other noisy area.
Stock your homework area with pens, pencils, erasers, and anything else you will need on hand when doing your homework., If you are ever absent, make sure you get notes from a friend before the next class. If there is anything you don't understand, go and ask the friend you borrowed the notes from or the teacher. This requires some effort on your part but will help you to continue to be successful in class.


Staying organized while making up for lost class time will help you in the long run. The information you missed in class will probably appear in quizzes and tests, so if you follow up and get the information you can still succeed.

Get organized the night before.,
Get up early enough so you have time to get ready.,
Be on time.",How to Get Organized for School3," Scrambling to get ready in the morning does not help you to feel organized for the day. To avoid a last minute scramble, put everything in your backpack the night before school, fix your lunch the night before, and set out your outfit the night before.


Getting ready the night before will also allow you to have a little more sleep in the morning. Fewer things to do in the morning means less time you need to get ready to go.
Make getting ready for the next day a habit, just like the habit of brushing your teeth before bed. Don't go to bed for the night until everything is organized for the next day.

, It can be very tempting to hit the snooze button on your alarm or sleep for just a few more minutes in the morning when you are very sleepy. However, if you want to have an organized day, it's important to give yourself enough time in the morning so you can get all the things you need to do done.


For example, waking up with plenty of time to eat breakfast is very important. Skipping breakfast in exchange for a few more minutes of sleep will not serve you well for the rest of the morning.
Don't underestimate how much time it takes for you to get ready. If you are rushed to get to school, then you will have a harder time settling into your day once you get there.

, It is hard to be organized and calm when you are rushing to school every morning. Being on time to school in an unrushed way is one of the most important things you can do to start your day off in an organized way.


If you are having a hard time getting to school because of other people, like your ride is always late, consider trying to change your means of transportation. Perhaps instead of getting a ride you could ride your bike, so that you can leave your home when you need to to get to school on time.

Take every opportunity you can get for help.",How to Get Caught up if You're Falling Behind in School," It can be scary, but you need to be able to gauge exactly how much you have to do.;
, Dedicate at least one hour a day to doing old homework, and you'll probably be caught up in at least a week.

, Make a pact with yourself not to get any farther behind while you work on catching up. Set aside time every day to gather all upcoming assignments and make a detailed plan for how you will complete them. This is showing responsibility and will get you motivated to get caught up. This is also helpful so you don't get behind anymore.

, Explain what may have lead you to fall behind and ask what you can do to get caught up. Your teacher may be able to connect you additional resources, like tutoring, check-ins, counseling, or other help.

, Is anyone else having trouble? Who might be able to help you? It's worth it to put yourself on the line to get this extra support. You might realize that the class is hard for everyone, which can make you feel less alone.

, Ask a teacher or a friend to tutor you after school or on weekends. This can get you caught up with everyone. This is really helpful if you're having difficulties in school or if you just need the extra help. Some schools even offer special tutors to help students.

, There are many people out there who can give you the support you need to make it through a tough class -- parents, teachers, counselors, or even friends. Don't be ashamed about falling behind. It happens to everyone, and the important thing is that you are dealing with it now.

Increase your ability to get a job.,
Make much more money in your lifetime.,
Avoid a future that includes jail time.,
Get to know your teachers to advance your prospects.",How to Get Excited About Going to School1," According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 12.4% of all people without a high school diploma in 2012 were unemployed compared to 8.3% of those with one. The outlook is worse when examined over a period of time. For instance, between 2000 and 2013, the average unemployment rate for those between the ages of 25-34 who did not complete high school was 15.1%.


Without a high school diploma, you can’t go to college and going to college is to your advantage.
For the same time period, the unemployment rate for 25-34 year olds with some college was 8% and only 3.6% for those who graduated from college.;
, Staying in school will make a huge difference in how much money you make after graduation. Those who don’t finish high school have an average income per year of $20,241 compared to $30,627 for those who did graduate from high school and $56,665 for someone with a college degree.A male high school graduate who works until he’s 65 can expect to earn on average $330,000 more in his life than a dropout, while a male with at least some college will make $538,000 more. The benefits don’t end there.


Without steady employment or a livable wage, there won’t be opportunities for vacations, let alone nice clothes or cars. In many cases, a car itself might be too expensive and owning a home may never be possible.

, Staying in school and graduating greatly reduces the likelihood that you’ll be incarcerated at some point in your life. Almost 1 out of every 10 young males who didn’t finish school was in jail or prison in 2006-07 compared to only 1 out of every 33 high school graduates.And roughly 30% of federal inmates, 40% of state prison inmates, and 50% of people on death row of both genders didn’t complete high school.

, Your teachers can be a great resource to you in a variety of ways if you take the time to reach out to them and get to know them. For instance, if you’re struggling academically, ask for help. Research shows that when students and teachers feel connected, students do better in school and enjoy their classes more.Strengthening your relationships with your teachers will also help you get a job when you graduate; get into college, a graduate program or a trade school; get scholarships to attend those schools; and get valuable insight into other ways to pay for furthering your education.


They have this knowledge and the very important ability to write letters of recommendation for you, which will be greatly beneficial in achieving your goals.
You won’t get these things from your teachers, however, if you don’t put in the effort to show them you care about your education.
If you’re in high school, set up a time to meet with your teachers to talk about your goals and things you’re struggling with. Ask them for help. And help them when you can – stay after class to help pick up things, volunteer if your teacher asks the class for help with something, offer to help hand out assignments or equipment during class and so forth.
If you’re in college, go to your professors’ office hours on a semi-regular basis. Talk with them and ask questions that show you care about school.

Be consistently level-headed inside and out, and don't over-think people or situation.",How to Fit in at a New School," You won't fit in at school if you don't know the school well yet. Ask where places are or ask for a school map.;
, Be nice to adults, teenagers and kids alike, because they might just be your next teacher or friend.

, Talk to them and find out more about them. See how strict or lenient they are, and test their limits. Just don't go too far, or you may end up getting in trouble (adding to your reputation, but you still get in trouble).

, Talk to different people, but don't ignore a certain group. Be yourself and don't lie. This is your school now... take a chance on being who you weren't at your old school.

, Teachers always pay attention to new students.

, When people talk to you, don't be nervous, but don't be too loud. Be confident and make eye contact. However, sometimes you may need to make yourself loud so that you will get noticed, and but try not to constantly attract attention to yourself. Don't worry too much about what people think of you; you'll over-analyze the situation and they might judge you for that. Be genuine, be yourself, and be nice to everyone, no matter how mean they may appear at first. It's usually always the 'girl/guy that you hated at your new school' that ends up being your friend after a little sincerity. But then again, don't be afraid to stand up for yourself if it's very clear that you should.

, Know where your locker is and have a map in case of emergencies, but whenever possible, ask the person sitting near you where something is. It's a good way to talk to people and meet a lot of people on your first day, - you're the new kid now, - tell people that you are whenever you need some help.

, Once one person hates you, their entire group will hate you too. Remember these people grew up together, so it's their obligation to defend their lifelong friends. Be nice, and optimistic, even if there happens to be an annoyance. They might even let you be the annoyance to another new kid someday, it usually takes a year and a half, but they'll come around. Always remember to make a good first impression but it's also important to be yourself.

, Usually, they will ask you if you're sitting with anyone, but if not, steer the topic towards school lunch (as in is the food good etc) If no one specifically mentions eating together, but you're walking to the cafeteria together, then it's implied that you'll eat lunch together.

, They could always know people you'd rather be friends with or introduce you to more people. Try to meet new people. However, if they are hated by everyone, then it is advised not to become best friends with them unless you really want to, don't get too into people, hang out with everyone, and make sure you know a group or person well enough before deeming them your friend, - it's usually always the most tricky, manipulative people that talk to you at first, and it's usually those who just talk to you later on, at the back of the classroom who are there for you later on.

, If someone passes a note or whispers something to you, ignore them so you can pay attention to the teacher.[[Image:Fit in at a New School Step 11.jpg|center, Make sure you are committed to that sport or club.

, Even better, ask them to do something over the weekend.

, While you don't want to be a complete kiss-up, kids like the people who will cooperate with them. If they ask you a favor, do it. Don't be too gullible, - people will sometimes even push your buttons to test what your 'limits' are, - like testing the waters. Just make sure you confidently (maybe even with a big smile on your face)... reply 'reasonably'. Like if they call you a ""jerk"" , - ask them why they called you a jerk. If they accuse you of something you didn't do, reply by saying you've never done whatever it is they are accusing you of, and then ask them who had said that.

, Never forget that while you might be trying to fit in, you should never try to be anybody but yourself. The first couple of weeks are always confusing.

Look forward to seeing your friends.,
Make new friends.,
Enjoy meaningful conversations.,
See your boyfriend/girlfriend or crush.,
Combat teasing.",How to Get Excited About Going to School2," One of the best things about school is seeing your friends who you can speak openly with, who won’t judge you, and who can help you cope with stressful situations or sad feelings. Good friends do all that. They also make school more fun., If you don’t have many friends at school or , you are not alone – even if it may seem that way. There are plenty of other students like you who would love to make a new friend as well. The best place to make these new friends is at school. And while it can be nerve-wracking to meet new people, there are things you can do to make it a much more smooth and enjoyable process. Here are some tips to help.


Be approachable. Many times we unknowingly wear our worries on our faces, and often that’s shown as a scowl. This can make others feel hesitant about talking to you. So make the extra effort to look up instead of at the floor and to smile at others.
If you don’t know what to talk about with a potential new friend, ask them questions about themselves. People typically love to talk about themselves. Icebreaker questions can be as simple as, “I like your bracelet. Where did you get it?”
Talk to the new kid at school and invite him or her to eat lunch with you. They’ll probably be very thankful.
Consider joining an extracurricular activity. Research shows that simply exposing yourself to new people you’re more likely to connect with them. Joining a club or activity that you enjoy will also help you meet like-minded people!
Being confident helps a lot in making new friends as well. One of the best ways to be more self-confident is to feel good about your appearance. So take a little extra time getting ready in the mornings. You’ll likely find it much easier to smile at others and ask those icebreaker questions when you know you’re looking your best., At many schools, you have the opportunity to meet and get to know people from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, religions, etc. You will also meet people with all kinds of quirky interests.Good conversations with new and old friends expand your view on life and make going to school much more fun.


They also give you a chance to learn things you may not learn elsewhere – about up-and-coming bands, fun events outside of school, and the opposite sex.
They can also really help when you’re feeling down. One quality conversation can change your outlook pretty fast and make you not feel so alone.

, Going to school or going back to school means you get to see that special someone in your life more often. This is especially exciting after a long break like summer vacation. If you’re single, school is also a perfect place to safely figure out what most interests you in a romantic partner. It’s also the best place to actually meet someone with those qualities. Where else are there so many members of the opposite sex your age?, Teasing isn’t a reflection of you and your true self. Nor did you create it. Nonetheless, it’s common in school. And if it’s happening to you, you need to figure out a way to handle it. Much of this will be dependent upon your personality and your readiness to stand up to it. Yet there are ways for all personality types – even if you’re very shy – to fend off teasing. Learning specific ways you can do this will help, even if it takes practice and maybe more time than you’d like. And remember: If the teasing doesn’t stop, if it’s dangerous, if the teaser threatens to hurt you or if the teaser even touches you, you need to talk with an adult (like a teacher) and ask for help. Now, some strategies:


If you tend to feel hurt easily, totally ignore the teaser, simply shrug and walk away, avoid the teaser as much as possible, give yourself a mental pep talk (“This really bothers me, but I can deal with it.”), visualize a bubble around you and how what’s being said can’t penetrate it or you, and remember you get to choose how you react.
If you’re ready to confront the teaser, simply say “So?” as you shrug and smile to the teasing remark, leave assertively (“I have better things to do than listen to this!”) and walk away, or make one assertive statement (“Leave me alone.”) and walk away.
If you’re starting to feel more in control of the teasing, say something that distracts from the teasing (“I hear it’s gonna me a good game tonight.”), make the teaser sound like a broken record and shrug or give a little smile with your statement (“Enough already.”), or state what’s happening as you raise your eyebrows or purse your lips (“You’re kicking my desk.”)
If you’re pretty confident and quick on your feet, disarm the teaser with humor (a funny one-liner) as you laugh and turn the situation into a funny one and use “I feel” statements (“When you said X, I felt Y. Please stop."")

Recognize the benefits of extracurricular activities.,
Find the right activity for you.,
Find out if there are requirements for joining.,
Ask others about how to get involved.",How to Get Excited About Going to School3," Participating in extracurricular activities, and taking leadership roles in them, is something colleges look for and often expect. It can make the difference between being accepted to a school and not. It also increases your chances of getting scholarships and internships. Being involved in them is also attractive to prospective employers. It shows both that you’re responsible and well-rounded.You also make new friends, learn new things, master skills, get the chance to compete, discover new interests, relieve boredom, take trips, and have a lot of fun. , Choosing extracurricular activities that benefit you in some way will make you enjoy doing them more. Think about your interests, abilities, how much time you can spend on it, skills you want to learn, and what you hope to get out of joining when you select activities. Talk with your guidance counselor or the activities department to see what is offered and how to become involved.Guidance counselors will also be able to tell you which activities look best on resumes and applications for colleges and jobs.
Explore several extracurriculars to see which is the best fit for you. And don’t avoid trying a new one if the first didn’t work out.
Sometimes a club or activity might not be a good fit because you don’t have enough time. If so, look for something that will work and stick with it.The quality of the activity and your level and length of involvement in it matters more to colleges and employers than the quantity of activities you participated in., To help you make a decision, you also need to know if there are any specific requirements for joining. You should find out if you have to be a certain age to participate. Ask if there are fees for joining or participating. Determine if you need to have a physical exam and if you need to try-out to join a sport. See if there are minimal time or event requirements. Finally, find out if there is a minimum GPA to join or to continue participation.


Also ask if there are opportunities to take on a leadership role in the group.
If there are, think about your strengths and ultimate goals when picking one., Aside from guidance counselors and activities directors, you can also talk to teachers, principals, other administrators, your friends, and members of groups about how to join. They can also give you insight into what’s it really like. Friends or members can be very helpful with this because they’re actually doing it.


Also check out bulletin boards on campus because clubs and organizations post information there. Write down the website address or contact information if it’s included on the poster or flyer. Then investigate it.Consider creating a club or activity that you’re interested in if your school doesn’t offer it. Talk with administrators about getting funding for it.

Work on your time management skills.",How to Begin High School3," Making new friends can make your high school experience better, especially in the beginning. Your new friends can help you navigate the school, and they’ll ensure that you have someone to talk to in each class and during lunch.To make friends, smile and talk to your classmates. When you get to your class, say something like, “I really wish this school had a Starbucks,” “Man, I was hoping not to do any real work on the first day,” or “Hey, that’s a cool backpack.”
Try to make friends with upperclassmen because they can help you fit into your new school and give you advice. Say, ""Hey, I'm Jenna. I'm new here,"" or ""You seem to know a lot about the school. Which clubs would you recommend?""

, Clubs are one of the best parts of high school. There are a ton of options, and it’s easy to start your own if you have a cool idea. Clubs will help you make friends and be part of the school culture. You’ll feel at home in your new school in no time.Look on your school’s website for clubs that seem interesting. You may even be able to contact the sponsor.
Keep an eye out for flyers since a lot of clubs will be advertising for membership in the early weeks of school.
Ask your friends which clubs they might join. Tag along to see if it’s a fit for you.

, Sports games, dances, pep rallies, and other school events offer you a chance to hang out with your classmates, which could help you make more friends. It also shows everyone that you’re making the most of your high school experience.Try football or volleyball games early in the year, as these are usually the first sports of the season.
See if your school has a back to school dance. Attend the homecoming dance and any fall/winter formals.
Find out if your school has a fall carnival or a related event.
Go to school plays, band concerts, and art exhibits.

, Since high school is a new experience, you can learn from what others have gone through. Listen to the advice of your older friends, and take lessons from what happens to you and your friends., High school classes are harder for many students, so you may find yourself struggling. You also want to remember that your freshman grades will count toward graduation and potential scholarships, so talk to your teacher if you need help.Most schools offer after school tutoring, so ask your teacher when to come. Say, “I had trouble following today’s lesson. When can I come to tutoring?”
You can also email your teacher to ask about tutoring times.

, You’ll have a lot of resources for help if you need it. You can talk to teachers, your counselor, the assistant principal, the librarian, and often peer advisors. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you’re confused about something, feel lost, or are having trouble adjusting to high school.Make an appointment with your counselor.
Ask one of your teachers for help, or ask them where you can find peer support.

, High school is a lot more demanding than middle school, so you’ll need to keep a tighter schedule. While it might seem like too much at times, it’s preparing you for life. Stay organized so that you can keep up in your classes and still have fun.Try using a planner to track your assignments, tests, and club events.
Budget out your time so that you have enough time to get big assignments finished.
Don’t commit to too many clubs and sports.
Make sure that you also have some down time to rest."

And if you don't plan on making new friends, then just stick with your besties in the halls and in what ever classes you share!;

Do not let the bully provoke you.,
Walk away from a bully whenever able.On the bus, this might involve changing seats when the bus stops and moving to a place the driver can see better.

,
Keep your heart defended when a bully is picking on you.,
Use humor to disarm the situation.,
Keep a record of what your bully has done.,
Talk with the bus driver or an adult.Sometimes admitting you need help can be the hardest part.,
Talk to other passengers about the situation.",How to Cope With Having to Ride the School Bus1," It's difficult to keep your cool, especially if you are being bullied in a public place. There are many different ways you can control your temper, but remember that there will be consequences for your actions should you respond to your bully's taunts.;
,, By hiding what truly upsets you from bullies, you guard yourself against it being used against you.

, In tense scenarios, even silly jokes can relieve the tension.

, Do not use this as a laundry list to try and punish your bully. Instead, approach an adult and let them know you've been having a hard time, that you're concerned about the bully because they've been acting out, and then if it's still appropriate, tell them about your experiences with the bully.

, If you feel hesitant about bringing an adult into the situation, remember that you deserve safe transportation free of bullying. If the adult you talk to does not take your concerns seriously, talk with someone else until you feel more comfortable about the situation.

, If you feel like you're being bullied, chances are there are others who either feel bad for you or are also being bullied. Bullies usually target people believed to be weaker than themselves, but banding together with your friends might make your bully reconsider hassling you.This is also a chance for you to get to know the other passengers better.

Take a deep breath.,
Accept that summer's over.,
Make two lists.,
Fill out your clothes list.,
Fill out your supplies list.,
Buy the things you need in advance.,
Try to find out your schedule.,
Go to open house.,
Take a week of sleep preparation.,
Look at the positives.,
Try exercising.,
Now you're ready!",How to Deal With a New School Year," Calm down and just face the facts coolly.;
, Sure, you had some great times over the summer, and no one wants those days to go away. But remember: you've always got next summer, too. Besides, Christmas break and spring break are good, too.

, Title the first list ""Clothes for school"", and the second ""Supplies for school"".

, Do you need more pants? Shirts? Shoes? Socks? Underwear? Jewelry? Belts? Whatever you need, think about how much you'll need of it. (Example, Two pairs of pants, five shirts, several pairs of socks, some jewelry.)

, Chances are, you're not going to have a sturdy binder or a sufficient amount of paper left over from last year. Think of all the supplies you're going to need for school. You can pick up most things at Walmart. Most schools (if not every school) have supply lists, so it'd probably be a good idea to pick one up.

, For clothes, you can go to the mall, an outlet store, or even the supermarket. Try to go get your things early; that way, the stores won't be picked over and you can get what you want.

, If you can choose your own classes, find out which ones are available to you and think about the ones you want to take. If you can't choose your own classes, simply get a schedule. These can be very helpful in preparing you for the next year.

, Most of the time, the teachers will have good information for you. That way, you can have a slightly better grasp on what you'll be doing.

, It's true; the last week of summer, everyone wants to go to bed as late as they can and sleep until they just can't. Although this is a tempting idea, try to decide when you go to bed during school and when you wake up. Practice this. If your sleep schedule is off and you can't fall asleep until midnight, trying taking a mild sleep aid to help you get back on track. Set your alarm.

, This is one more year to get out of the way, and then only a few more (or maybe none) until graduation, right? You'll get to see the friends you never saw over the summer. If you look at things on the bright side, the school year will go much more smoothly.

, Exercise can help clear your mind and rid your body of stress. Taking a moderate run or jog can help you feel better and more confident about taking on another year.

, Follow these steps and have a great year!

Distract yourself.,
Play a game of ""find it first."",
Grab a pen and paper and brave the high seas.,
Play dots and boxes.,
Explore fictional worlds.,
Battle your motion sickness.,
Make use of technology.,
Review rules and safety information.,
Handle embarrassment with self-talk.,
Don't allow loneliness to get you down.,
Don't feel like you have to go it alone.",How to Cope With Having to Ride the School Bus2," Many professionals suggest the use distractions to alleviate anxiety you might feel about your bus ride.Self distractions can take many forms depending on your interests and preferences. If you are the sort that likes scenery, you can take your mind off the bus ride by sketching the landscape or playing eye-spy with a friend. Many activities that you do in your room at home can also be used as distractions from whatever it might be that you dislike about the bus.

, Decide on common roadway sites, like convertible cars, construction vehicles, wood paneled vehicles, and others. Assign point values to the objects to turn the game into a competition with your friends.


Make things more interesting by giving rare objects, like a Rolls Royce, more valuable by assigning a higher point value.

, The board for the classic game battleship is numbered 1 - 10 horizontally and A - J vertically. Take turns trying to guess where your enemy's ships are hidden. Keep your paper hidden and place:


1 carrier (5 squares long)
2 battleships (4 squares long)
3 destroyers (2 squares long)
2 cruisers (3 squares long)
1 submarine (3 squares long)

, Draw a grid of unconnected dots and then take turns with your friends, each turn requiring a player to draw a single line to connect only two dots. When you form a box, write your initial inside to claim it as your own and earn a point! Each box you complete earns you a bonus turn.

, Though if you have motion sickness, reading might not be the distraction for you.Check out comic books, genres in your areas of interest (fashion, science, fantasy), or review schoolwork to prepare for your next class.

, You might be surprised to learn that anyone can get motion sickness.You can prevent this from happening by eating something light before traveling, sitting somewhere you can clearly see the road ahead of you, and wearing a wristband one and a half inches up your arm from where your wrist bends., Social media might make it hard for you to concentrate on homework, but on the bus it can make a difficult ride home a little more bearable. If you're not in the mood to interact with other people on the bus, pop in your earbuds and listen to some of your favorite tunes.


Handheld games can make your bus ride pass in a flash, but be careful to check bus rules before you play, as some districts do not allow handheld games at school or on the bus.

, Preparedness can do a great deal to ease your mind.Why not see if you can take a tour of the bus and meet the driver before you have to take your first ride? Most school districts and transit authorities provide online resources for bus etiquette, but some major points to keep in mind are:



At the bus stop, do not run, do not jostle others waiting for the bus or roughhouse with friends, and try to arrive five minutes before the bus.While on the bus, stay in your seat, remain seated while the bus is moving, talk quietly and try not to be distracting to the driver, and never play with emergency exits.Getting off the bus, do not run, go straight home, and never attempt to chase a bus down to retrieve a forgotten possession. If you drop something around a bus and want to pick it up, make sure you have the bus driver's attention and they clearly know what you are doing.

, Self-talk is your inner voice. It's what you tell yourself in your own head, and it's a useful tool to help you accept your need to take the bus. If, as an example, most of your peers drive to school and you ride the bus, you might feel self-conscious. When you feel this way, ask yourself ""Why? Does the bus really determine my worth?"" By doing this you will begin to address the source of your embarrassment, which is much healthier than avoiding it., It's frequently the case that people believe loneliness to be the result of a personal shortcoming or failure.The most important thing is for you to reach out when you feel lonely and have compassion for the fact that most people feel lonely at least some of the time.Focusing on the needs and feelings of others can help take your mind off feeling friendless and break up negative thoughts you might be caught up in., Many schools allow a parent to ride along while you adjust to the new routine of riding a school bus. Or, if you have friends or a relative that go to your school, why not ask them to have a sleepover so you have moral support on the bus the next day?

"
"
Prepare according to duration.,
Learn to sleep on public transit.,
Take stock of local faces.,
Decrease your stress.,
Breathe deeply.",How to Cope With Having to Ride the School Bus3," If you ride the bus for an hour or more, you might dread having to waste your time in transit. But you can make this time more meaningful by saving tasks you can do while en route. Bring a light snack to share with friends and a thermos full of tea, or put together a playlist that you've been meaning to give a listen.

, This is more difficult for some than others, but you can give yourself a fighting chance by packing a sweatshirt in your backpack to use as a pillow and ear plugs to deaden noise.


Set an alarm so you don't miss your stop!
Keep your possessions in hand, zipped up, and close to your body to prevent theft.

, Long bus rides give you ample opportunity to familiarize yourself with locals who might be future friends. People who live in your area will, much like you, probably be bored with the long bus ride and be happy to join you in some conversation.


Ask about favorite classes, teachers, or after school activities, or practice small talk with your new potential friend.

, High levels of stress could make time feel like its crawling by as you wait for your stop on the bus.Meditating is a great way for you to calm and refocus your mind, and has proven benefits for your health., This will slow your heart rate, slow your racing thoughts, and help you relax as the minutes pass and your destination draws close."

Take a bath.,
Set your alarm.,
Go to bed early.",How to Be Prepared for Your First Day of School1," Have a nice, deep, bubbly bath and relax in it. Get a stereo system and play something like classical music to calm down. Read a book, magazine or comi

c in the bath.;
, Learn what time you should be in school and figure out a time to wake up at. For example, if you need to be in school for 8:30 am, set your alarm for something like 7:00 am.

, Get to bed at around 8:00-9:00 pm. Read, Visualize , watch TV, chill out, or go straight to sleep.

Have fun!",How to Be Popular and Cool Girl in Year Eight," If you are in year eight, and you still wear your hair in pig tails and have Winnie the pooh t-shirts then maybe it's time to update your wardrobe. Cool shops for teen and tween girls are New Look, Accessorize and Claires Accessories. Although they are practical, jeans and hoodies aren't always the best thing to wear. If you are short, try a a skirt or a jumpsuit and a cute top. If you are tall, try maybe a tube skirt and a blouse, or leggings and a dress top.;
, Most schools have a set uniform and many are strict about them. Schools let girls wear stud earrings, so try a sparkly pair or some that match your eyes. Get in style shoes, although if you are tight for money then most clothes and shoe shops sell very cheap black ballet pumps. If your uniform is a skirt then don't wear it on your knees! The average length for teen girls is about 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm) above the knee. You can also wear patterned tights or coloured ankle socks (if your school allows it.) If you wear a tie then make it short and pin some badges to it. Thin chain necklaces are a great way to add to the sparkle on your head area, especially If you have your hair up. Small rings, friendship bracelets and charity bands are cool too. Try wearing a vest underneath your school shirt/blouse and letting it hang out under your jumper.

, Shower once everyday, or if you are sporty possibly twice a day. Wash your hair in the evening so it is dry when you wake up. Use deodorant and nice smelling soap/body wash. If you are allowed, you could shave your legs (you don't have to!)

, If you have straight hair, try a side fringe and a side parting or a scruffy bun with a fringe. If you have wavy or curly hair try a top knot or just leave it natural! If you fuss with frizzy hair to much, it looks even worse than when you started. All the steps so far have been about appearance, but that's not all you need to make people like you!

, Smile and laugh at jokes. It's good to make your own jokes once in a while as well, If you are upset about something at home or in school, tell people if they ask, instead of saying 'nothing', because then people will get the impression that there really is nothing wrong and you are just generally grumpy. People will like you if you relax and smile a lot.

, Don't tell people to shove off or go away just because you are having a bad day and they try to talk to you. Help people with books, hold open doors and generally be helpful. If you are nice to them, they'll be nice to you.

, Don't walk around the school grounds by yourself, find a group of people and walk around with them. If you are shy or uncomfortable in large groups, find one or two people who you think are nice and talk to them.

, It's all very well being friends on a low level with everyone, but when it comes to the crunch then you need some real friends that you can rely on. It doesn't matter if they're boys or girls, as long as you like them and know you can trust them then they're a brilliant friend.

, Find an activity that you enjoy in school (many girls like sports such as hockey, netball or tennis.) If you're not the sporty type, then try art or ceramic clubs. If there are other kids in your year doing this club, then you are bound to make friends with them.

, If you find it hard in some subjects, ask for help or go to a homework club. It IS cool to work hard, and people will admire you for it.

, Enjoy your time in year eight because its probably one of the best years of your school life. Just be yourself and everyone will like you for who you are.

Check the school's list if there is one––buy what it requires, otherwise you'll have to buy extra things later.;
, Go to orientations (open house) and talk to all your teachers. If you can, it may also be a good idea to meet the principal. While you are at the school, make a mental or physical note of where each class is located.


In some schools, if you ask, you can get a map of the school. If you do get one, write down the name of each class and the teachers on it. Study it before your first day of school so you know where everything is.

, You don't want to be late for class because you didn't know your combination or what class to go to.

, The night before, make sure that everything you need is in your backpack. This will keep you from forgetting anything in the morning.

, Doing this gives you one less thing to worry about in the morning.

, Have a binder that you keep all of your important papers in. If you have anything you don't need, don't keep it in your locker or backpack. Write anything you need to remember in your planner.

, What would have helped you during those situations? Pack these items into your kit.

, This can include:


Lip gloss. Use this when your lips are looking dull.
Lip balm. Use this when your lips have lack of moisture. Apply this before you apply clear lip gloss for a great lip look. Sometimes your lip gloss can dry out your lips, so putting lip balm on before will keep your lips healthy.
Cover up. If you have a problem with acne, this is a must-have.
Small, travel-sized bottle of lotion: Use this if your skin is getting dry. A great essential for winter and fall. Keep it lightly scented in case anther student has fragrance allergies.
Hairbrush or comb. If your hair gets messed up, use this. Try to get a miniature one to take up less room.
Hair accessories --- a few hairbands and maybe a ribbon. This is a great quick fix if you forgot to bring some or you are having a bad hair day.
Compact mirror. This is a lot easier than rushing to the restroom every time you need a mirror. Choose a metal flip makeup mirror.
Sunscreen. This is essential on a hot, sunny day. This is the most important; a pimple or bad hair is nothing compared to sun exposure causing skin cancer and wrinkles!
Mascara.

, Bring along your medication if you have allergies, rashes, asthma, etc. Many schools, with parental permission, will allow you to keep the medication with you while at school.

, Just go to the sinks in the girl's bathroom and wash up!
Hand Sanitizer. Great for removing dirt from your hands, as well as protecting yourself from the virus that is going around.
Deodorant. Great cover-up if you are sweating a little more than usual.
Tampons or pads. You never know when you will get your period for the first time or if you're about to get it. It is good to be ready, though sometimes the School Office may have one or two on hand.
Tissues. Tissues are great to have on hand when you have a cold and they work well to mop up spills. Look for travel sized packs that come with approximately 8 tissues each for added convenience.
Breath mints. Great for times that you forget to brush your teeth or when you ate something spicy.

, This might include:


Ten dollars. Money is great to have on hand for days when you forget field trip fees or lunch money. You might also want to bring some coins to school for use in vending machines and for city bus fare.
Extra socks. It sounds silly, but you might need them for PE or if you begin to get a blister.
Pencils/pens. Use these utensils only if you don't have anything else, and put it back in your kit.
Safety Pins. You never know when a button is going to pop off your jeans.
Food & Drinks. Try to bring things that won't spoil, like a granola bar and a bottle of water. Having food on hand is great, especially when you forget your lunch at home.

white school glue;
, The parts diagram will give you an idea of how everything fits together before you get started. It also includes the measurements for each of the foam board pieces that you will need.You can download the parts diagram at: http://anadiycrafts.com/diagram-parts-mini-desk-organizer/


, Glue guns are more effective when they are fully heated, so plug in your glue gun at least 15 minutes before you start working. If the glue is not fully heated, then your organizer may not be as sturdy., Before you cut out your foam board pieces, you will want to measure and mark each piece that you need to cut. Then, use your scissors to cut out the pieces. You will need to cut out:


two 16.5 cm by 16.5 cm pieces
six 16.5 cm by 10 cm pieces
four 9.5 cm by 15 cm pieces
eight 2.5 cm by 15 cm pieces
eight 3 cm by 9.5 cm pieces

, Get one of the 9.5 cm by 15 cm pieces. This will serve as the bottom of the drawer. Then, grab one of your 2.5 cm by 15 cm pieces. These pieces will serve as the sides of each drawer. Take one of these pieces and use white school glue to attach it to the 15 cm edge.The side piece should be secured onto the drawer bottom, not attached to its side.
Do the same thing for the other side of the drawer.
Let the pieces dry for about five minutes.

, Next, take one of the 3 cm by 9.5 cm pieces and apply glue to the bottom and side edges of the widest part of the piece (not the long, skinny edge). Then, attach the piece over the long skinny edges of the drawer base and side pieces.Wait for the glue to dry for about five minutes.
Do the same thing for the other 3 cm by 9.5 cm piece.

, After you have completed one drawer, you can move on to the next one. You will have four drawers total when you are done. Allow the drawers to dry while you work on the dresser.

, Take one of the 16.5 cm by 16.5 cm pieces. This is one of the sides of the dresser. You will need to mark this piece so that you know where to glue the shelves. Use your ruler and pencil to mark where each shelf will need to be placed. Leave exactly 3.6 centimeters between the shelves so that the drawers will fit well.Place the first shelf about two centimeters from the edge.

, Use the hot glue gun to apply glue to the long skinny edge of one side of a shelf (one of the 16.5 cm by 10 cm pieces). Then, press the edge of the shelf onto the dresser side.Repeat this process until you only have one 16.5 cm by 10 cm piece left. Do not glue the last 16.5 cm by 10 cm piece onto the dresser side. This last piece will be the back of your dresser.

, Next, apply white school glue to the long, skinny edges of the shelf that you just secured onto the shelf side. Then, take your other 16.5 cm by 16.5 cm piece and press it into place over these shelves.Your dresser should now look like a tiny bookshelf without a back.
Wait for five minutes before you attach the back. The white school glue needs to dry first.

, Next, apply white school glue to the long, skinny edges of the shelves and sides on one side of the dresser. Then apply the last 16.5 cm by 10 cm piece to this side. Make sure that the edges are all well-aligned and press on the piece for a couple of minutes to make sure that it is secured.Wait for at least five minutes before you do anything else with this piece.

, When you are ready to decorate, get your decorative paper and cut it so that it will fit the sides, back, and top of the dresser, as well as the front section of all four of your drawers. You will need:


two 16.5 cm by 16.5 cm pieces
two 16.5 cm by 10 cm pieces
four 3 cm by 9.5 cm pieces

, You can use your glue stick to apply glue to the edges of each part of the dresser that you are decorating. Only decorate one side at a time so that the glue will not dry before you have a chance to apply the paper. Gently press each piece of paper onto its corresponding piece.Apply the two 16.5 cm by 16.5 cm pieces to the sides.
Apply the two 16.5 cm by 10 cm pieces to the top and back of the dresser
Apply the four 3 cm by 9.5 cm pieces to the fronts of the drawers.

, Take one of your birthday candle holders and apply a small dot of hot glue to the center of the holder. Then, take one of your beads and press it into the center of the holder. Repeat this for the other three candle holders. These will be your drawer handles., Measure the front of each drawer to find the center. It should be 1.5 inches from the long edge and 4.5 inches from the short edge. Place a small pencil mark in the center of each drawer front to mark the center. Then, apply a small dab of hot glue onto this pencil mark and press the drawer handle into place., After you have applied the decorative paper, there will still be several exposed long, skinny edges on your dresser that you will need to cover up with ribbon. Cut strips of ribbon to fit these edges and then use the hot glue gun to attach the ribbon., The remaining four beads that you have will serve as the feet of the dresser. Turn your dresser upside down and then apply a dab of hot glue to one of the four corners of the bottom of the dresser. Then, press one bead into the dab of glue to secure it.Repeat this process with the other three beads

, Now that you have assembled and decorated the entire organizer, you can insert your drawers and use your new mini desk organizer on your desk.Fill your mini desk organizer with colored pencils, erasers, lip balm, or whatever else you like to keep handy at your desk.

If you have younger students, lower your expectations and think of creative rewards for the entire class.,
If you have older students, raise your expectations for their own good, talk to students individually, and explain disincentives.",How to Help Students Get Organized1," It isn't reasonable to expect a first grader to be perfectly organized, although it is completely fair to expect them to try. Younger students typically love the idea of a star chart or prize box. They are generally not influenced by the threat of a bad grade. It's generally easier to try to instill neatness as a habit into elementary school students. Remember not to single out any very young students for being messy, as they (generally) are not very successful at taking constructive criticism.;
, Academically motivated students in High School or Middle School are typically organized: They have realized that being organized makes it easier to study and boosts their grades. For students who haven't figured this out, you need to talk to them and explain why it is important to be neat, and then you need to follow through and show that you expect them to be neat. This habit will really help them, so don't feel bad about it-its for their own good. At this age level, students won't organize their binders for a cheesy incentive like a prize box. They need some kind of disincentive.

"

Buy a pencil case.,
Take all of your things and identify them.,
Fill up your case.,
Whenever you are done using a pencil/pen put it right back in your pencil case.,
If you happen to lose one stay calm.,
If you don't find it, that's fine.,
Every month, clean out your pencil case and refresh it with new stuff.,
Try not to loan out pencils.,
Download a daily reminder app.",How to Keep Track of Pencils/Pens and Not Lose Them at School," Buying a pencil case will help you keep your pencils all together.;
, Use masking tape to write your name or something to know that it's yours. If you don't want to do that you can also use little rubber bands and tie them on. Just anything to let you know that it belongs to you.

, Make sure everything is in!

, Never leave one behind. After every period you should make sure what you used is back in the case where it belongs.

, After the end of the school day or whenever you have time try looking for it. Remember it is easier because you have marked your pencil so you know it is yours.

, It might turn up. If it doesn't, oh well. Just work harder next time.

, It will make your life easier.

, Keep only 2-3 pencils in your pencil pouch so that you honestly don't have pencils to give to the pleading classmate (and you won't feel bad for lying to them later on). But if you really can't say no to your pencil-less pal, keep a pencil in your case that you don't mind losing and use it as a loner pencil to give to others.

, Such as, simple routine, and set a reminder after each hour/period. Or whenever you use your pencil/pen.

Offer extra credit or other incentives for the class as a whole if they show that they are organized.,
Track their progress and offer rewards at checkpoints.",How to Help Students Get Organized2," Do not, however, reward specific students with bonus points for being neat. This is academic favoritism and can be interpreted as very unfair.

,


For example, do a 'notebook check' once or twice a week. If a student has obviously made an effort, give them a star to put on their chart. Once they have reached a certain number, have them pick something out of a prize box. Or, if the whole class is organized a few times in a row, throw a little party or have a day where they can wear their pajamas to school; something fun like that.

"
"
Having organization be a part of their grade or give graded 'notebook checks' to make sure their binders are neat.,
Instead of lowering their grade, keep the student inside for recess or give detention.,
Tell the student(s) that you will call home and expect their parents' to punish them accordingly.,
If you can't read their handwriting, lower their grade or give them no credit.",How to Help Students Get Organized3," If you do this, have reasonable expectations based on age, and grade evenly across the board.

, This works with limited success, depending on the amount of students and whether or not they care. If the whole elementary school class continues to be messy, tell them that they will miss recess - the whole class. Detention may or may not prompt the student into action.

, Follow through. Explain the situation to the student(s) parents' and ask that they help in your mission to help their child get organized. Use good phone manners and don't blame the parents.

, Once again, this depends on the age. Children just learning to write cannot have perfectly legible calligraphy. Once students get into Middle School you should expect to be able to read their writing.

Wake up a little bit early the first day.",How to Get Organized in Your First Year of Junior High," Nobody likes to rush in the morning, so if you get your stuff (clothes, snacks, lunch money, lunch, etc.) ready the night before, you won't have to!;
, They fit great in your locker (or at least, they should), and it's easy to keep everything in one place. Write the subject on the spine or get different colors so you don't get mixed up. Try the standard 1 inch (2.5 cm), 3 ring. Avoid large, all-in-one binders as it is easy to accidentally file subjects incorrectly, leading to disastrous results. Also, if your school does not have lockers, manila file folders are helpful, especially if you have a habit of ""stuffing and running"" from class. They come in all sorts of colors, and are an easy, affordable solution!

, If you don't memorize your schedule, then you'll have to go around holding a piece of paper for the whole day. Believe me, you'll be the kid who can't think of his classes.

, Once in middle school, you'll probably be rushing in the morning. Come up with a routine and stick to it.

, Don't worry too much, or your bad dreams will come true. Just relax and stay positive.

, and write ""1st period, Miss _____"", ""Second period, Mr. ____"" etc, so you know the teachers names and where your classes are.

, Don't go too heavy on the make-up: some fruity gloss, a tiny bit of mascara, and some concealer and blush. If your school has a dress code, follow it. Wear whatever you like, what makes you comfortable.

, On the first day of middle school, make sure that you dress kind of nice. For example, don't wear your sloppy long black tee with saggy pants. And you don't have to wear a dress or something. Wear something like a nice tee and sweater with long jeans that fit. Or maybe a skirt and nice shirt. Something cute, but not too overdressed.

, Be sure you have paper and pencil first. They are the MOST important, but you should consider getting the following supplies, too.



Pencils. Consider getting a couple of mechanical pencils and a pack of #2 pencils. You will be prepared for tests that way. If your friends ask you if they can borrow a pencil, get them one of your #2 pencils because they don't cost as much.

Pens. You'll need these little widgets. Get several that are blue or black and several that are red. The blue and black ones are just in case your pencils don't work. The red ones are for editing ONLY. Do not ever use pens in math. Chances are, you will get in trouble and lose points.

Coloring supplies. They are for any class. Even my health class required them so talk about unexpected. You might want to bring skinny markers and color pencils. Skinny markers trace better and color pencils don't smell or look as bad as crayons.

Pencil boxes/bags. These are VERY important. It keeps all of your school supplies organized.

Elmer's Glue. Buy a bottle of liquid glue for the tough papers and a glue stick for those thinner papers. Make sure to buy the ones that dry clear because if not, you will be in lots of trouble.

Calculator. Calculators are a really cool widget for math class. Except, unlike all the other supplies, you'll have to check in with your teachers to make sure this is okay and which ones to buy. Most middle schools will ask you to buy Texas Instruments ones. They get pricey but they are all worth it. Sixth grade uses the TI-34II ones usually. Seventh to eighth grade uses TI-83 or 84 most of the time.

Book bag. You should buy a sturdy backpack for middle school because most schools don't offer lockers so you'll have to carry all your books around. Make sure that it doesn't have any childish cartoons. If you're a girl, you can also use totes. Messenger bags are also acceptable in some cases. Jan sport backpacks offer cute backpacks for all ages. Also try ""Aeropostale"" or ""Hollister"" bags. The material bags, not the bags you get your clothes in. But the bags you get your clothes in make great book covers :).

Keep your papers organized. Go for the plastic types because they don't rip as easily as paper folders. You can get cute designs and 3D effect ones, too.



Lock. Most schools ask you to buy one directly from the school, but you can go to a dollar store and buy one to learn from. If your school requires you buy one of theirs', dress it up! Draw on it in Sharpie! Polka dots, stripes, and smiley faces are cute.

Stapler. Always have one around in case you didn't staple your two page essay. You can make this cute too! Stickers, Sharpies, anything you can think of!

, Color coding is a great way to keep organized: 1 color for each period of class! Ex: Green folder, green binder for reading period 1.

, It'll help you. You won't be grumpy the whole day through, or fall asleep in class. A good first impression is very important.

, You MUST have a great breakfast or you won't be able to concentrate. It's the most important meal of the day. Be sure to include grains, such as toast or cereal.

, It's common sense. Don't wait till the last minute!

, If you're not sure how to do your hair, makeup, or outfit, wake up a bit early. That way you can get exactly the look you want with room for error. If you mess up, but still have 10 minutes left, wipe it off or comb it out, then try again! If your running out of time with one minute left for hair throw it in a hair band and for makeup throw on lip gloss and a little blush.

Search online.,
Check out other kids’ supplies.,
Shop early!",How to Have Stylish School Supplies1," Use the internet to follow new styles and ideas. Create accounts on social media and sharing sites like Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and the like. Search keywords (like “backpack” plus “new,” or “notebooks” plus “stylish”) to find images of what’s new and hot. Sign up for groups, alerts, and RSS feeds to keep up-to-date with new products and do-it-yourself ideas as soon as they come out.On the other hand, if your overall style is more of a retro-look, use the internet to find images of students from that era. Love to dress the way teens did in the 1950’s or any other decade? Research the sort of school supplies they used back then with key terms like “1950’s lunch boxes” so you can complete your look.;
, Sneak a peek at what your classmates are using. Use their choices as inspiration for your own. If you really like something they have, think of a way it could be tweaked to set it apart from theirs.


Say you really like the protective case that someone bought for their tablet or some other device. It’s plaid with broad stripes and earth colors. You don’t want to copy them by buying the exact same one, so ask yourself what you like most about it. Is it the colors? The pattern? Would you be happy with the same color scheme, only with much thinner stripes? Or would you rather have the same exact pattern in totally different colors?

, Don’t wait until the last week of summer to buy all of your supplies for the upcoming year. Avoid the risk of having to settle for stuff you don’t like. Buy your supplies before they sell out, and before everyone else at school buys the same thing!


Back-to-school sales will offer discounts on a lot of stuff you need all at once, but stores and websites have sales throughout the year. Use back-to-school sales to buy essentials that you need immediately and/or don’t care too much about, and do some comparison-shopping throughout the rest of the year to find the hot-ticket items you want most when they’re at their cheapest."

Make a good first impression.,
Dress for success!,
Get your clothing tailored just for yourself.,
Fix your hair and makeup too.,
Join a club, group, or class about something that you love.,
Strike up a conversation with the popular girls.,
Make plans with new friends.,
Be yourself.,
Be nice.",How to Be a Popular and Pretty Girl at School," First impressions are important. Especially if you are the new girl at school. Here are a few tips on first impressions.


Don't try to be like somebody else. If you do, then you have to act differently around that person all the time or worse. They'll find out that you're faking.
Always be friendly. If you're rude or mean, the person will look back at you in a negative way, and that is not what you want.
Don't talk too much. When you talk too much, that sends a message to the other person that you're a very self-centered person.;
, Wear something that looks good on you. Just because it's ""in trend"" doesn't mean you should wear it especially if it doesn't suit you. If your school has a uniform, check out these fun ways to shine out from the crowd.


Don't always wear sweats and a sweatshirt. Dress up one day, it will make you stand out.
For dress code, try and jazz up your school uniform as much as you can, if you want to.
Get your nails painted. You can paint them silver, pink, red or keep them simple with a French manicure.
Add accessories! Charm bracelets and bangles are cute, but don't add too many accessories or they might weigh you down during the day.
Shoes are important. Don't get a size too big or small because comfort beats fashion any day.

, Make your clothes more individual and fit just the way you like by tailoring them yourself if you can or by getting a professional to do it for you.

, Don't use too much hair gel, hairspray or mousse, or too much blush, lip gloss, and mascara. It might be tempting to use more makeup than you already have on, but remember that less is a lot more sometimes.

, That gives to the advantage to learn about what you like to do, and meet some people that have the same interest as you. Plus, you always have something to talk about with them!

, You might become friends with them. If you don't, don't worry! You can get some other nice friends and if you have good friends, you're considered popular in many people's eyes. If you do become friends, maybe they will introduce you to some of their friends, and that's a huge opportunity to becoming popular.

, Don't go too far though; if you seem too clingy or a friend pusher, chances are they won't want to be best friends with you. Give people personal space. Just don't push the friendship you have with these girls.


Try not to only have girls that are friends. Try to get a guy friend. They are way less full of drama. Just experiment with it.

, You don't always have to act and look like the popular girls to be one! Just be you. It's better that way. Though, at the same time try and be one of them too. It's hard to explain. If the girls think you are just like the other girls in your grade they'll not wanna hang out with you. Just don't let them take control of you, or make you feel like you're not better than them.

, Even if you don't like a person, remain civil and pleasant toward them. Popularity is mostly about how you treat others. You don't want to be known as the mean popular girl. Instead, be nice and proud, so people can look up to you and make you their inspiration.


Don't be mean, even if that person is mean to you or annoys you. Just don't do it. If it gets out of hand, politely tell the person to leave you alone.

Obtain and use a planner.,
Write things down so you don't forget them.,
Get the supplies that you will need for high school.,
Have a place to put papers for each class.,
Get a separate notebook for each individual class.,
Get your locker and backpack/tote in good shape.,
Establish a home study area.,
Develop good habits.,
Have something to eat before you start any homework or assessment.,
Get a good night's sleep every night.",How to Get Organized in High School," A planner is an indispensable tool for high school. Its pages can hold homework assignments, doctor's appointments, club meetings,sports practices, parties, and more.


The ideal planner is neat and organized, and gives you a quick and easy way to see your schedule and assignments for the day, week, and month. Some schools give out or sell planners (these often contain useful school information), and a lot require you to have one. Even if your school doesn't, go buy one of your own- it is a valuable tool for every student. Look for one that comes in a weekly format with a full view of each month as well, because these are the best for having a view of your week or month in advance. Also, look for one that's small enough to keep in your bag and carry with you and that has enough space to record assignments and dates.;
, Now that you have your planner, use it! A planner is a tool--it needs to be used to be effective. Any time something comes up, or when you have homework to do, write it down in your planner. Consult your planner every night to see if you have to prepare for any upcoming events and to see what homework you've got to do, as well as every morning to see what the day holds and if there are assignments due that need to be turned in or accomplished for that day. As you get used to using your planner, you'll see how indispensable it is and probably start consulting it even more often.

, There may well be no pre-made packages or lists such as in previous years. It's suggested that for the first day of school, you bring the materials that you want to put in your locker. It's also suggested to have a notebook to record what the teacher says that you will need for his or her class, and to jot down any notes. If he or she she does not say what you need for the class (normally not the case) it is good to ask your teacher after class (this is a great way to get to know your teacher).


It is great to have a binder, folder, notebook and loose leaf paper for each major subject. It's also good to have a homework folder and a daily planner.
For your pencil case, include blue and black pens for writing, red pens for correcting, whiteners (liquid is better), highlighters in several colors, paper pins, number two pencils, lead/mechanical pencils (with 0.9 lead, because everybody will have 0.7, and if they ask you for lead you won't have to spare any because you don't have their lead type), extra lead, erasers, and colored pencils. Each of these items has a specific purpose.

, Don't just stuff them in your textbook or backpack. You need to keep track of things so you can verify grades with teachers and ace those upcoming quizzes and tests. notebook usually look for one with 3 subject slots to have more space and better organization. Options include, but are not limited to:


A plastic file organizer: Basically, all this is is a plastic file holder that expands in an accordion style to reveal multiple pockets with tabs on each section, which act as individual files for all of your papers. These organizers are lightweight and compact, and by putting the name of each of your classes on each tab, they keep papers for every class separate while still allowing you to keep them all in one place. That way, if you remember you had a worksheet for homework or are in a class and have time to kill, you won't realize that the papers you need are buried in a separate folder for that class in your locker.
Separate folders or binders for each class: This option allows for the most storage space, but it may be a hassle to have so many folders. Get a different, distinct design or color for each one and label them clearly. Avoid stuffing papers into the pockets of a binder; instead, carry around a simple three hole puncher.

Notebook pockets: For classes with a lot of notes and not so many handouts this is a fairly good system. If you have a spiral-bound notebook you can keep papers from classes in the pockets. Having one extra folder for everything is also a good idea because chances are you'll outgrow the pockets.

, Yeah, it seems like a good idea to have one huge five subject notebook for all your classes because there's less to forget, but honestly, do you really want to bring three classes worth of notes and homework home if you only need the things from one? And, do you want to have to tell your teacher you lost your homework when you've misplaced it within your gigantic notebook. No! It's by far the best option to have a separate notebook for each class. If you don't want to get separate notebooks, at least get two or three subject ones.


Color code your school materials for each class. It is very important to keep everything for the subject together.
Write your name, teacher and subject on each notebook. Use duct tape and a permanent marker for this. To make it appear cooler, you can add pictures, doodles, and stickers (as long as it doesn't get too messy).

, It's impossible to be organized if your locker is jammed with loose handouts, old folders, and broken pencils or when your backpack is filled with gum wrappers and scraps of paper. Clear everything out! Throw out all the stuff that's obviously garbage, and then sort through the rest.


Get two locker shelves for your school locker and one for your gym locker. The top shelf is where you can store your personal items (lunch, jacket etc.) Underneath this, you have your note books and your textbooks. And under this you can keep your binders. Also, in your locker should be a mirror, calendar, pencil cup, white board, and extra magnets. The extra magnets are good for hanging up schedules, posters and pictures. Duct tape is a very bad idea, it is hard to take off and you may need to pay to fix it.
Look for a book bag that's roomy and has multiple pockets. Use a locker shelf to make the most of the minimal room. Throw away trash promptly and leave old assignments at home. Get into the habit of putting things back neatly where they belong, and your locker and book bag will thank you.

, Nobody wants to spend longer than required on homework, but without realizing it, you'll take longer just looking for materials. Find a place in your home where you're comfortable and there are no distractions from family. Getting a desk and putting it in your room is a good idea, as long as you feel you won't be distracted by its contents. You could also get a lap desk and do you work on your bed--just make sure you don't fall asleep! Make sure there are shelves and drawers for all necessary school supplies. Keep it clean and neat so that it's an inviting place to work in, or a little messy if that gets the creative juices flowing for you.


Load this quiet space with a separate pencil case, calendar, computer, writing space and bookshelf for homework.
Have some snacks stored in this desk, because doing your homework may get you hungry. There should be no distractions and everything you need should be close in hand.

, Establish routines to maintain your set-up systems. Come up with a set time to do your homework every day, and put it back in your backpack when you're done. Put everything you'll need for the next day in your backpack the night before, and set out your clothing and any extras and things you'll need. Consult your planner often, and check on, maintain, and alter your organization system when needed. Organized people are constantly tweaking their systems to adapt to new situations, and you should do the same. Be on time to class, make sure you do not fall asleep in class, and make sure to take the time to put the correct books in your bag. Be efficient and punctual, and try not to waste time and then pay for it later. With a little practice, you'll be good to go!

, This way you will have energy to keep you going. Bring a snack to school if you are late for breakfast.

, Trying to take a test in the morning when you had five hours of sleep last night is not a good idea. Eating breakfast in the morning is a good idea too. If you're not a breakfast fan, take a small snack with you in your backpack to eat before class. Studies have shown that students who eat breakfast before school get better grades than students who don't eat breakfast.

Sort out your old supplies.,
Coordinate with your school clothes.,
Express yourself.",How to Have Stylish School Supplies2," Divide them by what you’d like to keep using and what you’d rather never be seen with again.Ask yourself exactly what you like and dislike about each item. Don’t judge them by looks alone. Consider how well each item works in general, so you can replace the ugly stuff with supplies that work just as well, if not better. For instance:


Does your bookbag have enough space for all your books? When you buy a replacement, is it safe to go smaller, or will you need the same size or even larger?
What type of pen do you prefer writing with? Ballpoint? Rollerball? Fountain?
How advanced does your calculator need to be? Do you only need a basic one that could be found in a variety of styles, or will you have to limit your search to more advanced ones that are capable of doing what your classes require?

, Think of school supplies as accessories. Lay your clothes out and evaluate them. Ask yourself what colors, textiles, and patterns would match your outfits and which ones would clash. Know what you’re looking for ahead of time so you don’t make any impulse buys, only to find out later that they don’t go with your overall look at all!If you like to switch styles from one outfit to the next, but can only afford to buy a single bookbag, lunch bag, or whatever, figure out what colors and such are neutral enough to complement each outfit., Like any piece of fashion, school supplies can make a statement, so consider what you want them to say about you. Ask yourself what impressions you hope to make on other people. Do you want to be regarded as a serious student? Do you want your classmates to think of you as being oh so mature and elegant? Or do you love being you and don’t care what other people think? Consider which you’d rather do and shop accordingly:Advertise your interests: Make a list of your hobbies and passions. Search online with keywords based on your list, as well as the supplies you need (like “musical notes” plus “backpacks,” or “Batman” plus “notebooks”). Find eye-catching supplies that incorporate images of things you love.Maintain an air of mystery: If you want to avoid being pigeonholed as, say, “Soccer Girl” or “That Guy Who Really Loves the Beatles,” shop for supplies that appeal to your sense of style without broadcasting your private joys. For example, instead of notebooks with soccer balls or the Fab Four on the cover, shop for ones whose covers are made of unique materials and/or patterns. Use designs and colors to express your tastes while leaving a little bit of mystery about you.

Be taken seriously: If you want your teachers and schoolmates to know you mean business, adopt a more professional, elegant style. For instance, buy a leather-bound journal instead of a hot pink notebook. Or invest in a quality refillable pen with a case instead of using the same old disposable ones."

Customize pencils.,
Make a pencil holder out of crayons.,
Make your notebook belted.,
Cover your books with fabric.,
Make a book-safe.,
Make your own case(s) for your tablet.",How to Have Stylish School Supplies3," Either buy pencils that are already painted in bold colors, or spray-paint them yourself (be sure to wrap the erasers with tape first, as well as the sharpened ends if your pencils aren’t brand-new). Once the paint is dry, tape both ends to a hard surface to keep them in place. Next, gather lettered metal stamps to spell out your name or even a short phrase. Press the first stamp’s lettered end into a colored ink pad. Then gently hammer the lettered end into the pencil’s side. Repeat with each letter and then let the ink dry once you finish., Remove the label from an empty 6 oz. metal food can. Clean, rinse, and dry the can. Break out a 24-count box of new crayons. Apply glue along the length of each crayon and press it lengthwise to the can.Depending on how fast your glue dries, wait for each crayon to seal securely to the can before gluing the next one on in order to avoid dislodging any.


Use colored or customized pencils for larger cans.

, Match a belt with a hardcover notebook or sketchbook. Center the buckle-end of the belt (not the buckle itself) on the front cover, with the buckle pointing away from the spine. Super-glue the belt’s buckle-end in place. For extra support, gently hammer an upholstery tack through the belt, about midway between the buckle end and the spine. Turn the book over and glue the belt along the back cover. Turn the book over again, lace the remaining length of belt through the buckle, and poke a hole through the belt for the buckle’s tongue.Only use glue on the covers, not the spine. Gluing the belt to the spine would make opening the book again much more difficult.
Soft-cover notebooks may be more prone to tearing.

, Go to a craft or fabric store. Find material that matches your fashion style. Protect your schoolbooks with something a little more pleasing to the eye than a cover made out of grocery bags or newspapers!You’ll be using glue for this, so if the book belongs to the school, cover it with paper first. Spread out a flat piece of paper and set the opened book on top of it. On the paper, trace a line along the top and bottom of the book’s covers. Remove the book and then fold the paper along these lines to crease it. Place the opened book back in its original position and trace the left and right sides. Remove the book and fold along these lines. Slip the front cover into the pocket you’ve just created on the lefthand side, and then do the same with the back cover on your right. Smooth the paper so there’s no wrinkles.Spread out your fabric. Set the opened book on top of it as though you’re about to read it. Trace the outline. On the left and right hand side, draw a new line to give yourself an extra inch to fold inside the covers later on (if the book belongs to you, you can do the same along the top and bottom). Remove the book and cut along the marked lines.Brush the outside of the book’s covers and spine with glue. Open the book and set it down with the covers facing up. Place the fabric over the covers and spine so the original outline lines up with the book’s edges. Smooth the fabric out so there’s no wrinkles.
Brush more glue around the edges of the inside covers (if the book belongs to the school, only brush the paper). Fold the extra fabric over the inside of each cover and glue it in place. If the book belongs to you, cut slits in the extra fabric along the top and bottom, at each corner of the spine, before folding the fabric over. Once the fabric is glued along the top and bottom, trim all but the tiniest bit of extra fabric along the spine. Dab the edge of the spine with glue and fold the last bit of fabric over that to finish.

, Cover a thick, hardcover book with fabric that matches your style, or buy an extra copy of your favorite book. Hollow out the inside and glue the pages and back cover together. Use it to store your pens, pencils, and other supplies!Open the book to the very first page. Use a ruler to outline your inner compartment. Leave 3/4 of an inch or more between the edge of your compartment and the edge of the page.
Slip a piece of cardboard between the last page and the back cover to protect the back cover. Use a utility knife to slice through the pages along your outline. For straighter edges, use your ruler as a guide for your blade. If you want to, use scissors or sandpaper to smooth any rough edges left over from slicing.
Brush a light amount of glue over the outside of the pages, the insides of the hole, and where the last page touches the back cover. When you’re finished, slip some wax paper between the very first page and the front cover so they don’t stick together. Then stack other books or anything else that’s heavy on top of the closed book so all the pages remain flat as they dry.
Repeat the gluing process. The glue’s moisture may cause the pages to wrinkle, so it’s best to apply a few coats with a little amount each time, rather than slather the whole thing at once. Wait for each coat to dry before applying more glue.

, Buy a bubble-lined mailer that will fit your device when you slide it in horizontally. Find fabric that matches your overall style. Or buy a bunch of mailers and several different fabrics so you can create cases to match each outfit!Set the mailer on a surface with the shorter side (the one without the extra tab for sealing) facing up. Insert your device all the way into the mailer, width-wise. On the side facing up, trace a line along the outside of the mailer a little above the top of your device. Remove your device.
From the top down, cut along the seams on either side of the mailer with scissors until you reach your outline. Then cut along your outline to remove this piece from the front of the mailer (be sure to only cut the front and not the back!). Now fold the back of the mailer over the front to form a flap for your case. If you’re happy with its size, leave it. If you’d like the flap to be shorter, trim the desired length off.
Spread out your fabric(s). Use your mailer to outline and cut out three pieces: one to line the inside of the case, one to cover both the front and back of body, and another to cover the inside and outside of your flap. Each piece will cover two layers, so remember to double your measurements when using the mailer as an outline.
Glue, staple, or sew each piece of fabric to the mailer. Start with the lining for the inside of the case. Then do the case’s body. Finish with the flap.
Choose two buttons that match your fabric(s). Close the flap over the body of the case and make a mark on each to place your buttons. Cut a length of ribbon, string, yarn, or similar material and knot one end around one button. Use the other end to wrap around the other button and keep your case closed.

Empty the case or pouch.,
Shake or brush out the case.,
Spot clean the case.",How to Clean Your Pencil Case1," Take out the materials and set them aside. Before you deep clean the pencil case, you should remove the pencil shavings and graphite dust.;
, Loose wood trimmings, eraser remnants, and graphite dust will float out. Do this near a trash can to keep this mess from spreading.


For whatever’s left behind, you can use a small, soft brush to knock it loose. For a material that might get scratched, like a plastic case, use a smooth rag or baby toothbrush.

, If you clean out the case often, chances are you won’t need to do anything further than take care of small marks. Dip one end of a cleaning cloth in warm water and possibly a small amount of detergent, then rub over the marks.


To remove stubborn marks and ink stains from plastic, glossy cases, cover the mark in rubbing alcohol. Let it sit for a few minutes, rinse the case in the warm water, then dry it with the cleaning cloth or by air.Ink stains in fabric cases may be removed by applying rubbing alcohol to the stain with a cotton ball. Rinse the case so that the alcohol is removed. If that doesn’t work, repeat the process with nail polish remover."

Customize your uniform.",How to Be a Popular Girl in a Private School,"

Hair: Many girls wear their hair in a messy bun with one of those skinny headbands. If your hair is short or layered, and pieces fall out when you make a ponytail, use colored barrettes instead of a headband (they're cute, and give you that nice,unique look).



 


Nails: If nail polish is allowed, don't be afraid to use different colors like neons or sparkly polishes. Little details like your nails can show people your personality so be creative! If you just want a clean-cut, pretty look, you can try french tips (on your own if they're long enough or fake nails) or clear polish.






Shoes: In private schools, there are usually rules about shoes. Usually, they have to be dress shoes and/or be a certain color. If there are no rules about shoes, wear cute ones like uggs. Ballet flats are always cute. White vans are great as well, even though many people have them. You might be allowed to wear high heels. If you can, don't wear really tall ones and only wear heels in high school, otherwise you're just going to look weird. If you can, wear Toms. They are for a good cause, make you seem nice and giving, and are super cute. Also, Sperrys are cute too. You might think they're just for preppies but they're not. If your school allows it, get the ones with your favorite colors and patterns on the side. Also, try to wear colors that match your uniform. For example, if you wear a navy and green plaid skirt, wear navy or green shoes.






Make up: Do not go overboard on the make up; natural make up looks casual and pretty! Just make sure it looks natural and enhance your natural beauty. A bit of concealer, face powder, light blush or bronzer, thin eyeliner on top eyelash line, mascara and a very light lipstick - if you apply these things lightly, it will make your face look really pretty and not fake or caked on. Less is more.





;
, Attitude is one thing that can make or break you. If you act too confident, people may see you as being full of yourself or stuck up. If you aren't confident enough, people will think you're shy and won't approach you. Just smile, have good posture (back straight, shoulders back, head up, don't slouch), and look people in the eye.

, In many wikiHow articles, people suggest making small talk and using ice-breakers like ""It looks like it is going to rain"" or ""What class do you have next?"" Don't do that! Your conversations will run dry in seconds if you start with a topic like that. Turn to a group of girls and ask, ""Does anyone have Honors English 1 next hour?"". That way, you will give off a confident impression and also find someone to sit next to in the first hour! Talk to the girl that's going to be in your class and ask her what things she likes. Girls come from all over to go to private schools, so if you haven't heard of that thing before, ask her what that is. This will lead to a longer conversation, and maybe even a friendship!

, This will show your teachers that you are eager to learn and want to do your assignments correctly. And if someone asks to borrow a pencil or a piece of paper, don't be objective, lend it to them! It's better to be known as friendly, kind, and sharing than stingy and selfish!

, Eventually you will have a full table and lots of girls to talk to and it will appear to others that you are very friendly and easy to talk to since you are sitting with so many people.

,, You want to give a good impression to teachers, too! You can't have any friends if you're in detention all day after all!

, Do this on the second day or on Facebook. If you share the same interest, tell them you wanted to try out too, and ask if they know when try-outs or practices are. Sports and extra-curricular activities are a great way to meet friends with the same hobbies and interests as you.

, They might even try to get back at you so play it safe and if someone is bothering don't avoid it but just tell them how you feel. It shows that you have guts, and people with respect you for that.

, Either way, befriend one of the friendly popular girls and dress your best. That'll be your ticket in to the popular group!

, Tie a hair-tie to the back of your shirt to tighten it.

Dissolve baking soda in water.,
Submerge the case in the water.,
Rinse the case.,
Get a soft cloth.,
Rinse out the plastic.,
Dry the plastic quickly.,
Stuff the case with newspaper.",How to Clean Your Pencil Case2," About four tablespoons of baking soda for a quart of water should be more than enough if the only plastic you’re cleaning is the case. You can do this in a bowl or plastic tub in the sink., You can leave the case open inside the water or pour the baking soda water directly into the pouch. The baking soda will remove any smells, so you want to make sure the water gets inside of the case.

, Use warm water with enough detergent to make the water soapy. Run it under the water to make sure all the baking soda is gone, then drain the water you used.

, In a clean bowl, add a small amount of detergent to warm water. Dip this cleaning cloth into the water. Use the cloth to scrub out any leftover marks. Be sure to reach into the corners to make sure you’ve removed all of the dust and shavings that will make a bigger stain in the future.Some plastic scratches easily, so make sure your rag is soft. If you can’t reach a part of the case, use a soft brush such as a baby toothbrush.

, Put the case under a small stream of warm water. Turn the case over and open it up. Make sure all the soap is gone before you’re done.

, Use the dry end of a soft cloth. Get down into all the corners and the outside of the case.


Some plastic can develop water spots or mold if left alone, so don’t air dry.

, If a bad smell hasn’t gone by this point, crumple up newspaper, push it into the case, then leave it in an enclosed space such as in a kitchen container. The newspaper has the ability to absorb odors.

Find a clean bowl.,
Fill the bowl with warm water.,
Add detergent.,
Soak the pencil case.,
Rinse off the case.,
Air dry the case.",How to Clean Your Pencil Case3," The bowl or container you choose needs to be big enough to hold the pencil case. If it has dirt, leftover food, or anything else that would interfere with the pencil case, clean it out with soap and warm water.

, The water should appear clean. Cloth such as nylon, polyester, and cotton can be cleaned this way, but the water should not be hot or else it can wear out the fabric., A small amount of laundry or liquid detergent is needed. The label should state that it is suitable for washing clothes. All you need is a small amount to ensure that the water becomes soapy. Mix the soap in with a spoon or other tool until bubbles appear.

, Leaving it for approximately 15 minutes should take care of most of the stains and smells. Make sure the soapy water gets all the way through the cloth and gets inside any pouches.Alternatively, dip a soft rag into the water and then use it to scrub away any marks.

, Run it under the warm water again. Flip it and open up the pouches so that the water takes out all of the soap.

, Find a shady place to hang the case, if possible, or otherwise find a way to hold it up so the water drips off of it. Drying the case out too fast with warmth can wrinkle it or leave fabric bumps. The sun also wears out cloth and fades colors."

Fill a bowl with cold water.,
Dip a soft cloth in the water.,
Dab the pencil case.,
Use a specialized detergent.,
Remove the soap.,
Air dry.",How to Clean Your Pencil Case4," Again, make sure the bowl is clean. You won’t be putting the pencil case in the water, so it doesn’t have to be a large bowl.

, The cloth should be damp. Wring it out to remove excess water. Putting lots of cold water on canvas causes color bleeding.

, Touch the damp cloth end to the pencil case so that it wets the spot and picks up any dirt and graphite dust. To avoid using too much water, don’t leave the cloth on for long., Find one that is for fine washables. Put a little bit of it on the damp part of the cloth. Rub two ends of the cloth together to create some soap, then blot the areas that need to be cleaned.


Another gentle alternative to delicate laundry soap is baby shampoo, if you have any on hand.

, To do this, take a second damp cloth and dab the soapy areas. You can also rinse out your original cloth and wring it out again for use.

, Put it in an isolated place away from the sun. Let it sit for at least several hours to ensure that all the water has evaporated. After that, the pencil case is ready for use again.If your case is one that has a certain shape, such as the kind that stands upright, you may wish to protect it by stuffing it with material such as tissue paper or newspaper.

Wipe the case with a clean cloth.,
Put a drop of leather cleaner on the cloth.,
Wipe the leather.,
Wipe off excess cleaner.",How to Clean Your Pencil Case5," This will remove the dirt and graphite that has built up inside of it. It’s better to remove it now so that the grime doesn’t get pushed further into the material., Leather cleaner can be bought in stores. Leather easily absorbs chemicals, so it helps to get one of these cleaners since they won’t cause internal damage to the case.


Avoid vinegar and olive oils, as these leave stains and crack the leather. Essential lemon oil or natural baby soap with no color additives are better options., Using the cloth with the cleaner, wipe in a circular motion. Spread the cleaner over the entirety of the leather. The circular motion allows you to work in the cleaner and ensure that it covers the whole surface.

, If it looks like you’ve left too much, pick it up with a clean cloth. This helps the leather last longer since it doesn’t absorb more cleaner than it needs. Afterwards, it should look ready for use again.

"
"
Fill a sink or bowl with hot water and soap.,
Scrub out the graphite.,
Add some vinegar.,
Rinse off the case.,
Dry the case.",How to Clean Your Pencil Case6," Metal cases are hardier than plastic and fabrics, so you are free to use hot water on them and any dish soap or detergent. Collect the water then add a small amount of the cleaner to make it soapy.


Many companies offer metal cleaners, too. You may wish to check a local shop for one of them.

, Because metal cases are stronger, you can use most kitchen brushes or sponges. Using the brush or sponge, push the soap and water up into the corners and scrub any marks.


Avoid harsh cleaners such as steel wool, Brillo pads, and abrasive substances. These leave scratches that make future cleaning more difficult.
You may still wish to use a gentler cleaning material such as a soft cloth for the sake of reducing wear and being better able to get into the corners.

, Metal exposed to air oxidizes, which causes the unpleasant colors at the bottom of your pencil case. Add two tablespoons of vinegar to a quart of water in a pot on the stove. Boil this mixture, then soak the pencil case in for 15 minutes. Repeat as needed., Put it back under warm or hot water in order to remove all the soap or vinegar. This removes any possible erosion from those chemicals and prepares the case for drying.

, Grab a cloth or a paper towel. Wipe away all the water. At this point, the pencil case should look ready for use again. If stains persist, you may wish to clean with vinegar if you haven’t tried or only did it once.

Ask other children in the higher grades (10th grade and up) if they received any materials list the freshman year.,
Prepare to look around the city or town you live in.,
Look for copies of the supplies list in the mail.,
Walk into the school to see about what supplies they'll need.,
Look for the more grown-up-like versions of highlighting tools you once used.,
Look for calculators that are called scientific calculators instead of the standard ones you might used to be taking to school, but do not be tempted to purchase any graphing calculators (unless the teacher later tells you you'll need to purchase a graphing one).,
Base some of your other essentials on some of the electives you'll potentially be taking.,
Look for a few additional items you might not be used to taking to class with you.,
Buy at least one compass and protractor for schoolwork now.,
Purchase a stainless steel (with a corkboard-like backing) straightedge/ruler with you for every math class.",How to Determine What School Supplies You Need as a High School Freshman," Having gone through at least one year of school, most high school upper class members should have a general idea of what they'll need on a day-to-day basis. If there's something that's only needed for a short period of time, the teacher should be able to tell the students to purchase it a few days before.;
, Some supermarkets may have a listing of what is needed for your school. Find out if your school even participates in such a program.

, It is sometimes included at the time the student's schedule comes. Sometimes, much like any other year, this list will be supplied to the student.

, Talk to the staff at the main office of the high school to see if the student will be receiving a list, or how they should go about finding out this information.

, Purchase at least a pack of highlighters at first, along with a pack of colored pencils. Leave your crayons you once used at school behind for the colored pencils.

, Scientific calculators are geared at high schoolers in their freshman year and are a go-between the standard and graphing route that most freshman high school textbooks(Math and Science) are based on. Due to the dual usefulness of it's many functions, a scientific calculator is something you should keep with you to every Math and Science class period along with a variety of other Business classes(such as Accounting and Business/Practical Math) as well.

, With all the Food and Industry core (formerly called Home Economics), Technology, Business, Theatre, Music, and Art classes taught at most schools, you'll need to see what things you might need on a daily basis (without causing a distraction) by taking the simple to class on Day 1 and purchase the additional items over the days following(up to the following weekend).

, Use 3-ring notebooks to store your pages of homework and notes along with or composition books with perforated pages for written work.

, You might not need it routinely in school, but you'll occasionally need it at home for math with compass constructions and such. You may still need a protractor from time to time (especially in a mechanical drawing/drafting or math class), and it's good to keep one on hand.

, These durable rulers (some Math teachers don't like these short form most elementary and middle school teachers call these utensils) are useful and don't put drag on the students. The corkboard back makes them lightweight, and yet the stainless steel won't allow these straightedges to bend as much and break) when compared with their predecessors that tend to break more-often.

Have Awesome Hair.,
Wear Minimal Makeup.,
Get Involved Socially.,
Get Involved With School.,
Be Healthy.,
Have GREAT Hygiene.,
Get the Wardrobe.",How to Be a High School Celebrity (a La Cher Horowitz)," It doesn't have to be blonde, but it has to be healthy and stylish. When you go to get your hair cut show the stylist exactly what you want. Don't EVER trust them to pick a cut that will be flattering on you, and only go to somebody that you trust to do a good job, and who you know can cut your hair the way you want it. Look up reviews of different salons before you decide, otherwise you'll regret it later.;
, Definitely wear some makeup, but remember that makeup is meant to enhance your natural features, not to hide or change them. You also don't have to spend $100 at sephora to get the look that you want. For school wearing some eyeliner, mascara and lip colour/gloss should be fine, but don't be afraid to jazz it up with a smokey eye or popping lip colour for social functions and events.

, Go to parties and try to talk to people from different cliques/friend groups. Saying that you don't drink, smoke, or do drugs isn't an excuse not to go to parties, because no matter where you are you won't be the only person sober. If you do drink, smoke, or do drugs don't make a fool of yourself by getting too wasted, and when you drink make sure that you're drinking something classy(ish) like Palm Bays, or vodka/gin tonic, etc. Never get drunk though, because Cher drinks but is never portrayed as drunk or high. It's not classy. Aside from parties, hang out with lots of cool people after school, and at lunch. Just remember that whoever you hang out with can be cool (Tai!) Find a good spot to eat lunch every day where lots of other people can sit with you too. Make sure it's in the most central spot in your school, so that everybody can see you and your posse having a good time, and they'll want to join in. Don't ever make fun of people even if they're trying too hard or trying to be like you. Be nice to everyone. Keep up on all the latest gossip. If something happens, from a breakup to an arrest you want to know about it.

, Do your homework. Just because you want to keep up a social life doesn't mean that you can ignore your studies. This isn't middle school anymore and contrary to popular belief people actually like hanging around people who are educated and can keep up an intelligent conversation. Aim for A's and B's in all your courses, and try to have a developed vocabulary. As Cher would do, read one non-school book a week. And remember, good grades=freedom. If you get grounded for failing your courses your social life is in the toilet.

, Try to get at least 45 minutes of exercise every day. Focus more on cardio than strength, but killer abs never hurt either. Don't try to look like a body builder, but looking toned and slim is a great thing. You need to feel confident with your body, even if you're not at your goal weight. Eat healthy all the time, except for occasional french fry/pizza binges with your girlfriends. Make sure that if you bring a lunch to school it's the healthiest meal of your day. You don't want everyone to think you're a pig, or that you don't care about yourself. A good idea would be a piece of fruit, vegetables and some whole wheat crackers, or a dainty sandwich on whole wheat.

, Smell good. Have a signature scent, like grapefruit or caramel, and try to buy all of your body wash/lotions in that scent, or a scent that goes with it, so that you don't smell overpowering. Layering scents isn't rocket science, but it's just as important. Shower daily, and do whatever you've gotta do to your face to have as clear skin as possible. Make a list of things you need to do, from head to toe, and don't forget anything, including shaving/waxing/plucking, which you need to do if you plan on wearing short sleeves, or any bottoms other than pants. Hairy legs and pits are a huge turn off to most people. If you're opposed to hair removal for whatever reason try to keep your legs and armpits covered at all times. Example list: wash hair, pluck eyebrows, clean ears, wash face, shave armpits, wash body, lotion body, manicure, shave legs, buff feet, pedicure.

, You don't have to spend a lot of money or dress out of your comfort zone to be fashionable. Yoga/sweat pants are comfortable but they are not appropriate for school. You'll come across as sloppy and slobby if you don't put an effort into what you're wearing. Nothing looks sillier than a girl with her makeup and hair done who is wearing track pants and an old school t-shirt. Some stores that sell stylish, affordable, and original clothes are Forever 21, H&M, Garage, and Sirens. Thrift stores often always have cute pieces that are more vintage, and that nobody else would have. These are good options because you can replace your out of date outfits more often, and therefore be more in fashion at all times. Some stores that are a little bit more expensive but tend to have slightly nicer clothes are Urban Outfitters, American Apparel, and Simons. Department stores and local boutiques are also good places to shop. However, if you go to a boutique try to go to one in a different town because chances are that the other girls at your school shop at the one in town, and nobody likes to spend $30 on a shirt to find out that her arch rival has the same one.

Embrace the real you.,

Listen to others.",How to Be a Girl People Want to be Friends With1," No matter what, the most important part of being liked by others is being yourself. If people like you for your fake personality, then they don't really like you. They only like who they think you are.Be confident and make sure you always stay true to yourself., A happy expression is contagious. Smiles put other people at ease and show your own sense of friendliness. You might cheer yourself up if you're feeling down., Give your undivided attention to the person speaking to you. This means turning off your phone and stashing it in a place outside of your eyeshot. When you really listen to others, you're showing them that what they have to say matters to you."

Don't let go of your old friends.,
Go on some social networking websites.",How to Be a Girl People Want to be Friends With2," Say “Hi” when you pass an acquaintance. They'll usually say ""Hi"" back. Make friends with people you normally wouldn't hang out with. Even if you just make friends with one person from another clique, it can possibly lead you to being friends with the whole group., They’ve been there for you from the start. You can always be yourself around them. Don't let your busy social calendar get in the way of solid friendships.Introduce your old friends to your new friends. This way, you can help them expand their social circles. At the same time, you'll get to enjoy everyone’s company.

, Websites like Twitter and Facebook keep you in touch with friends even when you're not with them. It also helps friendships grow. If you don't want to keep conversations between you and a friend or two, send a direct message or set up a private group.


If you're under 18, get your parents' permission before opening a social media account.

Diversify your taste in music.,
Try new hobbies.,
Get involved in your community.",How to Be a Girl People Want to be Friends With3," Listen to different types of music. For example, if you normally just listen to pop, try techno, rap, or rock. Look for new singers or bands on YouTube or social media. Visit a few download sites and buy the songs you really like. Your interest in new forms of music will give you things to discuss with new and old friends., New hobbies can help you bond with people who like the same things. Join a sports team, take a knitting class, or take up some other form of recreational activity to do in your free time. Search online or read through campus bulletin boards for these opportunities to make new friends., If you're a student, check your school's website for volunteer opportunities with campus clubs. If you're not a student, search the web for local opportunities with your favorite organizations or causes. Just a few hours a week could put you in touch with several potential new friends. It'll also give you a chance to show off your caring self."

Become a leader.",How to Be Cool at School," One of the easiest things you can do for your popularity status is stay fresh and smelling good. Kids in school tend to judge a book by its cover, and being smelly is a one-way ticket to the rejected. Take showers regularly, brush your teeth, floss, and use deodorant. You'll look more attractive, whether you're a guy or a girl, too.


It's also a good idea to wash your face regularly. Pre-adolescence and adolescence is a breeding ground for acne and black heads, and washing your face can combat that.
If you're worried about sweating during the day thanks to the weather or gym class, keep a stick of deodorant or a good-smelling spray in your locker or bag.;
, In addition to not being clean, you also won't attract a lot of friends if you looked like you just rolled out of bed, regardless of what age you are. Take a few minutes in the morning to style your hair however you think it looks best. A little bit of effort goes a long way, even if it's just a bit of gel or a couple rounds with a flat iron or blow dryer.


If you don't like your hair currently, get it cut. No idea what kind of cut? Odds are your hairstylist will be able to tell you what kind of cut will look good with the shape of your face. You could get highlights or a different color, too.

, Every school is different, and there is not one individual look that ensures you'll be cool. At some schools its the rebels who are ""cool,"" at others it's the ""jocks."" The only thing you can really do is pay attention to your clothes and make sure you walk out the door with a look you know you like. Are your clothes clean? Do they match? Do you feel confident in them? That's most of the battle right there.


If you feel like you look good, you'll walk around acting like you look good, and others will follow suit. So much of personality is confidence. You don't have to be especially beautiful or especially smart or especially funny; you just have to be confident and the rest of the world may just be fooled.

, When it comes to your clothes and your accessories, don't be afraid to have your own sense of style. Discover the clothes you like to wear, the brands you like, the accessories you like, and create your style. Wear those clothes to school and be unique. Who knows? You could start a trend.


Being cool is also about being a leader and doing your own thing – not about being a follower. Don't worry about the people who judge you about your clothing and those that are trying so hard to blend in (these are often the same people). Your own sense of style will attract those who also have their own sense of style.

, Being cool isn't just about being popular, it's about being known. And what's the easiest way to get your name and your face recognized? By joining groups at school, of course. Try to join a few that don't overlap – that way you'll meet the most people and have a wide variety of interests.


Try to join one of every kind of activity: one athletic, one academic, and one artistic. You could be on the basketball team, on the school newspaper, and in choir. It'll look good on your college resume, too.

, Try to identify who's where on the ""social ladder."" It's not that big of a deal (being cool is about being liked, which is different than being popular), but it will help you know how to identify with people. What are the cool kids like? Are they jocks, are they smart, are they rebels? How about the mid-crowd? Do they follow along or sort of do their own thing? And the lowest tier, what about them? With whom in which groups do you want to be friends with? It's a good idea to be friends with people on all rungs of the ladder – you never know where you'll end up.


If you do want to be popular, it's a good idea to befriend one of the nicer popular people; they'll be your ticket into ""the group."" Just make sure you don't abuse people on your way up. Sometimes friends don't work out, and then the rejects won't even want you later when you need a friend., Again, being cool doesn't necessarily mean you're popular. There are plenty of ""popular"" kids that are mean and not actually liked. Being one of them won't get you anywhere. Instead, aim to be popular and cool by having people legitimately like you. To do that, just be friendly and nice to everyone you meet. Why would you do anything else, right?


You probably have a pretty good grip on how to be friendly. The only thing to keep in mind is to be friendly to those people that you think aren't cool. Give them help when you sense they need it. Say hi in the hallways if you know them. You never know – they could be the next cool kid in a few months' time.

, Just because you're trying to move into the cooler crowd, you shouldn't leave your old friends behind. If you try to ditch them, the people you want to join will know — and no one wants to be friends with that type of person. Make new ones in addition to the old.

, You can spend ages on your hair/makeup and just say that it takes ""one comb through."" They will admire you because it would take THEM hours while it takes YOU 5 or 10 minutes. They will want to be like you, but don't keep mentioning or bragging about it.

, Just about every adult will tell you that when you grow up, you'll realize that being cool doesn't really matter and if they would've known that being cool is about not trying, they wouldn't have stressed so much. Though it's easier said than done, try to relax a little. If you're trying too hard, it's a turnoff and people won't think you're confident and that you don't like yourself. And if you don't like yourself, why should they?


Here's an example: let's say this person you don't really know asks you out on a date. You say no. Then, they start sending you love letters. You still say no. Then flowers. Next thing you know, they're outside your door at night. They are trying really, really hard. Is it working? No. In fact, it's the opposite of working. You wish they had a little self-respect and you just want them to go away.

, Try your best to not care about what you think other people think of you. Just go with the flow. Why? Because not everyone is going to like you. No one is liked by everyone because we all have flaws and we all have different personalities. If you know for sure someone is judging you, you can voice it, then just act like you don't care, because you don't. Practice thinking this way and your confidence will improve via self-acceptance. People at school will start wondering where you got all this self esteem!


This is where style comes into play. The skaters have their style, the plastics have their style, the nerds have their style, etc. We're all different and nothing is necessarily better than anything else. If someone is judging you, they're caught up in their small, closed mind. They're not going anywhere anyway, so don't get on the friend train with them. It's a one-way ticket to a dead end.

, Don't be mean to other people in your school just to make yourself seem cooler. In fact, people generally hate bullies, they're just too scared to admit it to their faces.In time, the bullies lose their power and then they're left with nothing. It may be tempting now, but in the long run it will only do you harm.


Don't spread gossip or start rumors.
Don't make negative comments. Just because you don't like someone, or something they've done, doesn't mean you need to voice that.
Don't exclude others. After all, you're reading this because you want people to like you.

, It's easier said than done, but in school, using your sense of humor and your good social tactics are the key. With friends at your side, you'll be untouchable. If things get too bad, tell a trusted adult so they can help deal with it.

, Remember that part above about how being cool is about being liked by lots of different people? Well, to get all these different types of people liking you, you've got to like them. Open your mind and try to see that not only the coolest kids have value – that everyone does. You'll come off as a friendly, more likable, happier person – and that's the type of person most of us want to be around.


Taylor Swift, Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Zac Efron, Kristen Stewart, Lady Gaga – these are all pretty cool people who were not cool in school (or so they say).This is proof that if you're not open-minded, you could miss out on some pretty awesome people.

, Being respectful to others even if they aren't your friends shows that you don't discriminate people based on anything because they are not your friends. You'll develop a positive reputation of always being kind and considerate and being friends with everyone because they can rely on you and that you won't judge them. That definitely sounds pretty cool.


A good way to make friends is to make them laugh. If you're cracking jokes at another's expense, just make sure they get it that it's in good fun. And try to stay away from making fun of teachers – that can easily backfire.

, You know that kid who's sulking in the corner, all dressed in black, who's always frowning and talking to no one? Doesn't seem very happy, does he? Do you want to hang around that negativity? Probably not. If you want to be a magnet for people, to get all of them liking you, stay positive. Keep your chin up, be willing to laugh at yourself, and spread your positivity and awesomeness. Other people will end up flocking to your side so it rubs off on them.


And will it rub off on others? Probably. Some studies say that just being around other happy people makes us more likely to be happy; and hanging around sad people makes us more likely to be sad. So could you be that beacon of light for your friends? Of course!

, When it comes to humans, we're pretty simple. We know what we like and we don't like, and something we definitely do like is a person with a smile on their face. Not only does it show others that you're happier, make you more happier (your mind actually starts believing it), but it can make you more sexually attractive, too. Put a smile on your face and see how you feel. Eventually it'll become a worthwhile habit!


Try not to put a fake one on either. Keep it natural. Most people can see through a fake smile. If you stay positive, having a genuine smile shouldn't be too hard to come by.

, Though the phrase ""be yourself"" is repeated frequently, it doesn't mean that it's not valuable advice. In fact, it should be pretty clear between ""don't try too hard"" and ""stick to your own sense of style"" that being yourself is where it's at, unless you are not cool, then, you have to change yourself to be cool. Why does being yourself, if you are cool, make you cooler? Being yourself means you're comfortable with yourself and you're more confident. When you try to be someone else, you're just an imitation, and phonies are definitely not cool.


Think about it: only you can really be you: no one else can. You're unique and have a set of characteristics and skills that no one else around you has. You can offer the world something different. So why try to be a second-rate version of someone else? You is definitely cooler than anything else ""you"" can be.

, In recent studies, it has been shown that kids who were cool in middle school generally aren't as successful in the long run as their less-than-cool peers.So if you're stressing about being cool and popular now, try to see that the kids who are cool now are likely at their peak in life. It's all downhill from here for them, and all uphill from here for you. That's a win, even if it doesn't feel like it.


In short, being cool is temporary. Eventually, as we age, we realize that ""cool"" doesn't really exist. We move on and we all start to do our own thing because it's what makes us happy. If the cool isn't coming easy to you, just wait. It gets easier with time.

, The cool people can't be followers, because they're the ones who set the trends. Take the initiative when it comes to making plans. Listen to different music, and introduce your friends to it. Start new games, and wear new styles. Not everything you do will become a trend, but being a follower isn't good for your status.

"
Be genuine.,
Wear creative clothes.,
Play sports, take on a hobby, or join a club you like.,
Have good hygiene.,
React calmly in embarrassing situations.,
Do not be a follower, or else you will be looking up to someone for the rest of your life!,
Don't take sides.,
Host hangouts and parties.,
Act sophisticated.,
Use a little technology to help you come off as cool.,
Make genuine friendships.,
Be confident.",How to Be a Cool Girl in Fifth Grade," Treat others with kindness and be as friendly as possible to others, but stay ""real"". Don't act like you are someone else. Be who you truly are!;
, Be the trend setter. Wear casual clothes that look cute, such as brand-name clothes.


Make sure you wear matching clothes and don't try mixing crazy colors. But if you think the colors match, go ahead!

, This will get you involved in things outside of school and in your home. You have to care about school, but you also have to allow yourself to participate in extracurricular or out-of-school activities, too. Do a sport that involves your interests, like swimming, gymnastics or soccer.

, Nobody likes dirty hair, smelly armpits, or stinky feet.


Take showers or baths at home regularly. Shower with gel soap or just any ordinary bar soap (showers at school are good too!) Try brushing your teeth two times a day, nobody likes yellow teeth or bad breath at all!
Use deodorant like ""Secret"" or ""Degree"" if necessary.
Always carry a Kleenex in your pocket, or somewhere nearby. You definitely do not want to be in a situation where you have a runny nose and don't have anything to stop it except your fingers.

, Imagine this: You're walking out with your lunch and then, oops, drop your napkin, then you pick it up when, oops, dropped your fork. When you get to the milk accounts you slip on a wet floor, and pizza gets all over your shirt. Do not ever get up, throw away the pizza, and rush to the bathroom. Just laugh about it. It will make all embarrassing things go away. Always look like your life is perfect just the way it is. But don't laugh too much or people will think you are weird.

, If you find someone cool, and you have something in common, try talking to them.


Never depend on other popular girls.
Don't hang out in cliques. Usually cliques make others feel bad, and then nobody will like you.

, If some girls are in an emotional fight, stay out of it. If you take sides, you may end up getting into trouble.


Do not tattle. Tattling just shows you are a little baby who tells on people! Cool girls do not tattle. But, if there really is a situation where you need to tell an adult that something is wrong, do so. There is a difference between tattling and doing the right thing by reporting something.

, Always be a great hostess. Popcorn, movies, Truth or Dare, and dancing are some of the things you can do, have, or watch at a sleep over. Don't throw too many parties, and don't send out invites if only two people can make it. It'll make you look socially inept.


Try finding a great game you can play, and be the center of attention! Not a desperate center, but a cool relaxed center.

, Do not be too wild or crazy. Be a little sophisticated and mature. If you're wild and crazy all the time, it gets really annoying and nobody will like you. Be too serious, and people will think you're boring and nobody will come to anything you host. Somewhere in the middle.

, Have a cool phone case and make sure to have a passcode so nobody can see your personal stuff, like text messages.


Have a variety of cool music, including whoever is most popular at your school (also have more than one singer). Have a lot of songs!
Add everyone you know and have cool apps that people use (Instagram, Minecraft, etc.). Also have an app where you can send people stuff (like online cards or something). In addition have a cute, sophisticated up-to-date picture of yourself. Do not reveal too much or try to look older than you are in these photos, there are creeps online who search for that. You can be cool without attention-seeking through makeup or revealing clothes. Also, only add friends. And don't make your password obvious like your name, last name, or best friend's name.
If someone sends you a mean email, IM, or text, just brush it off. Even if it bothers you, tell them that you don't care and block them from contacting you online.

, Having lots of high-class friends is not a necessity for being cool.


Try not be friends with the mean girls. Don't be mean back to them either. In the end, they'll be the ones in trouble.

, Girls like to have a best friend who is sure of herself. If you're insulted, just reply with a snarky comeback, or an amused look, and walk away. If you're mad at that person, even though you had a good dis, have a party. That'll cheer you up and if you're really feeling up to it, have sleepovers and cool activities once every week.

Dress up to go out in the evenings.",How to Have an Awesome Overseas Class Trip," There's nothing worse than arriving at a hotel and finding you've forgotten your pajamas or something. Also, never skip items on your check-list because they aren't cool. If your teacher/group leader has said that you need a waterproof coat, you probably need one. You don't want to end up ruining your holiday over a small detail like that.;
, If you are going hiking through the alps, you will not need your bikini or your flip-flops. Take a reasonable sized suitcase that will easily hold all your things, and doesn't need to be sat on for you to close it. If you suitcase is black, brown, gray or navy blue put a brightly coloured belt or something else distinctive on it that will make it easily recognisable. You don't want to have problems because someone else has picked up your bag thinking it was their own

, Make sure you where comfortable clothes, and possibly bring a blanket and pillow if the journey exceeds four hours, or is at a time when you would normally be asleep. If you are taking any electronic entertainment such as iPods or games consoles, make sure they are fully charged before you go, and if possible bring the chargers with you as well.

, If possible, ask your teacher to sort out who's sharing with who before you go on your trip. If not, just agree with your friends where you'd like to sleep so that there are no arguments when you get to your hotel.

, Check where the fire exits are, and make sure you pay attention when the safety drill is explained. Always lock your door when you leave the room, and make sure you lock any interconnecting doors between rooms as well. Keep your room keys with you at all times.

, Plans that are too detailed will never work out. Just go with whatever happens in the day, you'll probably end up having more fun that way, and you might end up doing something you never would have planned. If you really have to plan something, you could pre-arrange a time to come home at the end of the day. That way, you feel you aren't totally running wild.

, No holiday with friends is complete without a mega midnight feast. Make sure you bring all your favourite snacks with you, but buy any fruit or dairy products once you're there because some countries have laws on what foods you can bring in them. You should also take advantage of the different foods that you can get abroad and not back home. Doritos, cookies, chocolate, sweets and popcorn are must-haves at a midnight feast.

, Just because your teacher says that you can't have boys in girls rooms, and vice versa, doesn't mean that you have to stick to that. Don't try anything dangerous, like scaling buildings though, just stick to simple tricks. A great one is to hide any ""forbidden guests"" in your bathroom, along with someone from that room, and put the shower on whenever you hear a knock at the door. When the teacher comes in, you can say that your friend is taking a shower, because no teacher is going to ask if he/she can check. You could also use low windows as a means of escape, but only if you are on the ground floor as it could be dangerous.

, This may be the only chance to impress the girls/boys in your school with your superb dress sense and ultimate style. There's no point staying bundled up in an anorak and tracksuit bottoms for the whole holiday. It's great to get glammed up with your mates and go out for dinner without any hassle from parents or teachers, and you never know when that special someone might be looking.

, Let of go the old bad feelings. Forget about all the bad things you've been called in your old school. Forgive your old friends' misbehavior, such as making fun of you. Forget your embarrassing memories, since no one in your new school will know about it -- a new school is a new start.

, Take time for yourself. In the last couple of days before school starts just relax, play in your room perhaps and think about the good and cool things that may happen during this year. Stay positive! That's what confident people do!

Stay clean by washing your face, hands and shower as often as you can.
Make sure you smell good! People will be attracted to you.
If you are a girl who likes makeup, try not to overdo the makeup but instead, try a simple style to begin with. If you find that other students have a look you want to try, go for it, but you may want to gauge what's allowed and what other students do before you do something extreme like turquoise eyeshadow.
Wear some simple accessories. Some examples are watches, bracelets and much more! Just try not to were too many things.

, Try doing something you haven't done since you were a kid.

, Take a class in something you would like to learn (such as a CPR class and painting lessons). It's always good to learn something new, and learning a new skill is also amusing.

, You can bring some friends along with you. Visiting a carnival is very entertaining and allows you to do various things, such as riding on rides and playing carnival games.

, Water balloon fights are always very amazing, and they give you an opportunity to 'fight' your friends while having fun at the same time. They are also very good because you can get wet, cooling you off while the weather's hot and might get over 100 degrees.

, Sleepovers keep you entertained because you get to do enjoyable activities. Do anything that entertains you, such as playing Truth-or-Dare, painting your nails, and watching a movie.

, Movies keep you entertained if you pick a movie that interests you. Rent or buy movies, or watch ones you already have.


If you don't want to watch a movie at home, try going to a movie theater.

, If it's hot during summer and you want to cool off, swimming is a very good choice. You can swim alone, or with your friends and family. It's also good to try playing pool games.

, It's always amusing to go to the beach and sit in the warm sand. You could also try walking or swimming in the ocean, as people feel comfortable when feeling the ocean waves.

, They look very cool, and are fun to make and play with.

, Pictures are very pretty, especially for your photo album. You can photograph whatever you want, including yourself, a friend, family member, or an object.

, Going camping gives you the opportunity to see the outdoors and take a break from being inside. Try having a campfire, as it is very entertaining.

, Barbecues are always fun and allow you the chance to eat delicious food. Invite your friends, family members, or whoever else you want to invite.

, You can print them out from the internet or just use one that you already have.

, Make sure that you indicate what time they'll take place.

, For example, on the July 15th square, you might put ""Play Star Spangled Banner on piano by today"" or ""Must see movie by today"".

, These are:


One time activities: things that happen once. These are things that you'll do once and will only need to schedule once. This might include things like seeing a movie and going bowling with friends.
Process activities: these are activities that you need to schedule more than once. Process activities are typically things that require practice, like learning to play a song on the piano or goals, like learning to do a back flip. These often need to be broken down into smaller activities.

, Think about timing. You might want to see a movie on a Friday evening, but want to go bowling with friends on a weekend afternoon. Write the times and activities down on your calendar.

, For example, you may decide that you'll need to practice 10 times for an hour each before you will be able to do a back flip.

Reading doesn't have to be boring. Choose whatever age-apporiate book that interests you and start reading! Keep a reading log, to keep track of new vocabulary. You can read anywhere! In your backyard or on your balcony, on your bed, or out by the lake. Reading doesn't have to be boring!







, Museums in your hometown can be great way to pass the time as well as increase your knowledge.

, Not all of us are straight ""A"" students. Take this time to go to the library and review material for the next year in advance. Since it's summer, you can do this at your own pace. No need to rush or stress out. It's just important to not forget anything you learned in the past year over the summer

, Unplug the DVD player. Get out of your house and get some fresh air. Don't spend the majority of your time indoors.

, These days, almost everyone is always indoors. How about going to the park to meet up with your friends. Maybe you can find a sports field and play whatever you want. Do you have a phone/iPod and just love it to much? Put it to good use! If you have an iPhone/iPod touch you can install the Nike+ app from the App Store for free to track how much your run. You and your friends could have a competition.

, Walks in the park can be the be one of the best activities all summer. Find a local cul-de-sac and ride your bike (five to ten laps a day is a suggestion). Riding your bike is a good way to stay fit and occupy yourself at any time of the year.

, Find a sport that you like. Swim at a local pool; a good cure for summer boredom.

, If you usually go on vacation in the summer, start packing now! Can't afford to travel far? No problem! Do some exploring in your own city/state/province. Go on a road trip with your friends and family. Find out what's on the other side of that lake. Be creative!

, If summers are hot where you live, you can go to the beach with your family or friends. Run around your front yard under the sprinklers. Some water parks have great discounts at times during the summer, so you can also try browsing the internet for discounts! But be careful, if there's a heatwave outside, you might want to stay out of the sun, or even go indoors, in an air conditioned room (especially if you have asthma). Avoid being in direct sunlight if it's hotter than 90 degrees (32 C) and stay indoors at all times if it's hotter than 100 degrees (37 C)

, There is nothing worse than spending your summer in a hospital room because of a broken bone, or at home in bed because of the flu. Put safety first!

, Marching band is a great way to have fun, meet new people, and not be bored all summer.

, Want to practice the piano? The violin? Go for it! Want to improve your kicking skills in soccer? Your batting skills in baseball? Go for it! Practice doing something-- anything (preferably not video games!)

, Try painting a portrait of your friend at the park. Or how about shooting a mini mystery movie right in your own home, then editing it on your computer. You could write a song, preform it, and even make a music video out of it, with the help of Garageband and iMovie if you have a Mac (there are other programs for PCs, just Google what you want) Maybe you want to reenact a play. Decorate pretty outfits and show them off. Let your creativity shine!

, It's the small things that matter. So enjoy them as much as you can-- the birds chirping, the flowers blossoming, the water splashing. You're going to be missing these things in December! If you have a phone, take picture and post them to Instagram, to share your memories with others. Or make 6-second masterpieces with the Vine app for your phone. They're both free, and they'll help you remember these memories forever!

, If you have an idea, no matter how ridiculous and crazy it may be (as long as it isn't illegal) go do it! If you think there isn't a way, get help to make your plan happen.

, Ask your friends and family what they are doing so you can get more ideas of what to do.

, It is amazing what you can learn from your family. Go to grandma's and ask her about her childhood. Girls night out with mom! Basketball with your siblings. Fishing with dad. Never be embarrassed of your family!

, If you get bored one day, contact one of your friends. Maybe invite them over for a sleepover, or just chat. If all of your friends are away for the summer, try new things. You might make some new friends there.

, Getting a good summer job is sure to keep you busy.

, Go to the mall, park, community center, library, YMCA, wherever you want to. Talk to people there. Get to know them. Start a bond. Make new friends!

, Try Capture the Flag or Manhunt at a local park/field with lots of cover at night. Don't forget flashlights, bug spray, and walkie talkies!, Try going to your local community center. You can sign up for sports/activities there for cheap prices (sometimes even free!). You can also volunteer! Try volunteering what interests you (otherwise you won't like it!). For example, if you love animals, you can try volunteering at an animal shelter, and take care of those pretty kitties!

, Isn't it relaxing to watch your fish swim? How about taking your dog on a long walk in the neighborhood. Maybe kitty wants a back scratch. Don't forget about your pets. You are their best friend! Don't have any pets? How about having a tea party with your stuffed animals (you can never be too old for that!) or you could prove your responsibility, do chores, and other work so maybe you could get a pet of your own! Or you can always try volunteering at your local animal shelter if your parents say ""no"".
