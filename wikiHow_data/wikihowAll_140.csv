Replace your heatsink.,
Add more case fans.,
Replace your hardware.",How to Monitor CPU Temperature," Your BIOS is the menu that lets you adjust your computer’s basic settings. Most BIOS interfaces have a hardware monitor built-in, which will allow you to check the temperature. You have to access the BIOS when your computer first boots up.


If you are running Windows 8, open the Power menu and hold the Shift key while you click Restart. This will start you in Advanced Startup Mode, where you can open your motherboard settings (UEFI) in the Troubleshooting menu.;
, The key varies depending on your hardware manufacturer. Typical keys include F2, F10, and Del. The correct key will be displayed on the same screen as the manufacturer’s logo.


If you do not hit the key in time, your computer will boot normally and you will have to try again.

, Different BIOS programs will have different section labels. Some of the more common labels are H/W Monitor, Status, PC Health, etc.

, The temperature limit for your CPU will vary depending on the model, but generally you want your temperature to be less than 75° C (167° F). Check your CPU’s documentation to determine the exact temperature threshold.


Check your other temperatures. While you’re checking your CPU temperature, check to see how hot the rest of your system is running. Most hardware monitors will also tell you the motherboard temperature, the graphics card temperature, and possibly ambient temperature in the case.

, Most motherboards come with hardware monitoring programs included on the installation disc, or available from their websites. You can also download freeware programs that will read your BIOS’s temperature readings and report them back to you. Popular programs include:Open Hardware Monitor
Speedfan.
Core Temp
HWMonitor
Real Temp

, Once you’ve downloaded/installed the program of your choice, run it to get a readout of your computer’s temperature. Most programs will display all of the temperature readouts, along with fan speeds and voltage measurements. Check all of these against the recommended levels according to your system documentation.


Some programs may require special access to your computer’s settings to run, and will prompt you to continue before they can work.

, Make sure that none of the fans or vents are blocked. Open up your computer and blast out the dust using compressed air. If air cannot flow over your components, heat will begin to build up.

, Thermal paste is what conducts heat from your CPU to your heatsink. As time goes on, the thermal paste degrades. Opinions vary on how often thermal paste should be replaced, but if you are experiencing higher than normal temperatures, this is the easiest place to start.


Don’t use an excessive amount of thermal paste, as too much can actually insulate the CPU instead of conduct the heat. A small dot spread evenly over the CPU is the most effective way to use it.

, If your CPU is consistently running hot, your current heatsink and fan may no longer be up to the task. Find a new heatsink/fan combo that will fit in your case and move more air than your existing setup. Larger fan setups can lead to more ambient noise.

, If your case is not getting good airflow, you may need to install more fans to get air moving properly. Fresh air should be coming in from the front and top, and get exhausted out the back of the computer.

, Older components tend to overheat after long-term use, and sometimes there is no other option than to replace them. If you have to replace your motherboard or CPU, you may want to consider rebuilding your entire system, since you will need to reinstall everything anyway.

Determine which method works best for you.,
A software based solution will require that each computer under control has a network connection.,
Obtain software and service for your computers.,
A second software based option is the open source solution called ""synergy"" this works across operating systems, when simply trying to control several computers locally with one keyboard and mouse, a ""soft"" KVM switch if you will.

,
A hardware based solution can be achieved with a ""KVM Switch"" KVM is an acronym for ""Keyboard, Video, Mouse"".,
Purchase any additional cables needed to complete connections between the KVM and the computers and I/O devices.

,
Select the product that has computer and operating system(s) support for your setup.,
Install the KVM and software as specified in the manufacturer's instructions.

",How to Operate Multiple Computers With One Keyboard and Monitor," Hardware and software based solutions are available. Read on to help figure out which is best for your personal situation.;
, The network can be a LAN if it will be controlled locally only, or an internet connection if it will need to be controlled from any computer in the world with an internet connection.

, One such provider is LogMeIn. They have several levels of service ranging from free for ""simple remote control"" (LogMeInFree) to the more robust ""full service"" offerings (such as LogMeInPro) but has a monthly fee of about US$20 per computer. The LogMeIn service in general works very well, but like any network based solution, is best when connected by high speed LAN or broadband internet between the computers. Select the service level that best meets your needs, create an account and download / install the software.

,, These devices typically have connections for multiple Video inputs from the computers and a single output to connect to a monitor. There are also multiple PS/2 Mouse and Keyboard outputs to connect to the computers and two inputs for connecting both a keyboard and a mouse. Newer KVM switches have transitioned from PS/2 and round Keyboard connectors to the popular USB ports instead. Be sure to obtain a KVM that supports the style Keyboard and Mouse connectors the computer uses or obtain adapters. Due to limitations on the length of cable that KVM (and USB for that matter) signals can travel, all the computers will probably have to be located fairly close (within 10 feet or so of the KVM hardware) unless some other repeater or extender hardware is employed.

,, Many KVM's install device drivers and use a small program to switch between computers. This means if multiple OS's are involved, drivers will be required for each in order to work properly.

, Simply copy and paste the work into the body of an e-mail message. Alternately, if there is limited room yet enough for one document, save it to the hard drive. Include the work as a file attachment, and email it to yourself. Log back into your email account to verify that the attachment did not become corrupted, by opening or viewing it. When satisfied that it is a good copy, delete the original from the hard drive to conserve disk space.

, Services like this are offered at www.freewebs.com (there are others). An account can be created there for free.

Note that in order to access Potions, you must explore the chapters of the first book until you get to the Potions lesson in Hogwarts.;
, Cure for Boils is the easiest and fastest, but it also earns the fewest House Points. Other potions are more difficult and time-consuming, but earn larger rewards.

, Some ingredients can be collected in Moments, but others must be purchased in Diagon Alley.


If you are out of an ingredient you need, it will have a button labelled ""Buy"" next to it, which will take you to the Apothecary. Remember that if you use, say, a bezoar, you can go back to where you found it and re-collect.

, You can view your cauldrons on the Cauldron tab of the Potions book. If you do not have any cauldrons, you will need to buy one before you can make a potion.


Note that different cauldrons will brew at different speeds. Pewter is the slowest; brass is faster, and copper is fastest.

, This will bring up a menu where you should confirm your choice of Potion and Cauldron, and click Continue.

, You will see a page of instructions for the potion, which includes pictures of the ingredients. Read the first step and close the instruction book. This will take you to the Potions Bench.

When adding ingredients, use the counter to the left of the receptacle to check you have added the correct amount.
To crush ingredients in the mortar, repeatedly click the pestle until the progress bar is between the two markers.
To heat ingredients in the cauldron, use the buttons underneath the cauldron to turn the heat on high, low and off. Keep the heat level between the two markers until the time runs out.
To stir the cauldron, click the spoon and circle your mouse in the correct direction. Use the counter to measure the number of stirs.

, You can bring up the instruction book again by clicking the book on the desk. After each instruction you complete, open the book and check that the task has been crossed off, then proceed to the next instruction.

, When you have completed all of the instructions, click your wand to wave it. It's located just below the potions book.

, If you have successfully followed the instructions, you will be asked to return to your potion after it has finished brewing. (For more complicated potions on a slow pewter cauldron, this can take up to 100 minutes, or even 24 hours for Polyjuice Potion Part 2.) While the potion brews, you can close the page and log off Pottermore if you wish. The progress of your potion can be checked on in the Cauldrons tab.

, When the potion has finished brewing, open your Potions Book again. Underneath the potion you are making will be a button labelled ""Brewing"". Open this in a new tab or window, keeping the Potions Book open. You should see a countdown timer; click ""Next"" to return to the Potions Bench.

, You will be given some more instructions to follow to complete your potion. Follow these in order and wave your wand again.

 ;
, It will give you a basic outline of what Points2Shop is about and how do you earn points. You can also ask your referrer for questions.

, You're probably ready to earn some points, so watch the Points2Shop Introduction Video. After you watched the video, you should have earn your 5 points.

, These are the activities that you are going to be doing everyday to get points. The activities are: SOOP, Click Offers, PeanutLabs, RadiumOne, Sponsorpay, and SupersonicAds. There are many other activities like surveys and tasks, but they are not recommended since they are either hard or they take too long. What you're going to do in your daily activities is watch videos. Here is how you do it.


Activity #1: In SOOP, all you have to is click a button to get 5 points.
Activity #2: In Click Offers, you'll go on the Call of Duty website and click on one of the recent threads to get a point. Then you watch a Call of Duty video to get a point.
Activity #3: In PeanutLabs, scroll down the list until you spot a video. After you watch the video, keep watching other videos until you watched all of the videos. Refresh the page and repeat the step until there are no videos left.
Activity #4: In RadiumOne, you do the same steps as PeanutLabs.
Activity #5: In Sponsorpay, you go to the video tab and do the same steps as PeanutLabs and RadiumOne.
Activity #6: In SupersonicAds, you go to the videos tab and do the same steps as PeanutLabs, RadiumOne, and Sponsorpay.

, There's this special activity called Manual Offer. You get a lot of manual offer whenever your Honour Level increases. When a user gets a new Honour Level, they get access to new features and offers. To increase your Honour Level, you must meet a certain requirement. For example, if you just joined Points2Shop, you're rank is probably New. To get to Bronze, you must verify your address and purchase an item.





, When you completed an offer, you probably encountered a wheel where you will need to spin. When you spin the wheel, you have a chance to win something. For example, you could win a sweepstakes. You can use the ticket to enter the current sweepstakes. If you win the sweepstakes, you will earn a reward. There's also other stuff to do, like contests, game, and even a lottery.





, A referral is a person who has clicked on your link to register on a website. Referrals can help you get money, because a percentage of their offer earnings go to you! Try to put your referral link on your blog or on your social networking profile. When a referral gets a referral, you get a smaller percentage of that money. The money varies depending on where the referral lives. Also, if you get a certain amount of referrals, you can get the Honour Level promoter.

, Why don't you get yourself a starter item? Go to Spend Points and to Low-Cost Rewards. Go to Pop Rocks and click Add to Cart. On the additional details, pick your flavor: Strawberry, Tropical Punch, or Watermelon. You should get your first order soon, and your rank should be updated.

, If you have any other questions, just post in the forums or chat in the shoutbox. Try not to post a lot in the forums, because once you're banned, there's no way you're going to make another account.

The free version of Bandicam is limited to 10-minute recordings, and all recordings will have a watermark (logo) on the video. You can purchase the full version to remove these restrictions.


When downloading Bandicam, use the Bandisoft download link. Downloading from Softonic will include adware in your installation file.;
, Bandicam's installation is straightforward, and you shouldn't have to make any changes to the default settings. You can choose where you want Bandicam icons to appear (desktop, quick launch, and Start menu).

, Once Bandicam is installed, you can start it up to begin configuring it for recording. You may be asked for an administrator password if you are not using an administrator account.

, You can access this menu by selecting the Video tab on the Bandicam window, and then clicking the ""Settings"" button in the ""Record"" section. Make sure that the Sound tab is selected in the ""Recording settings"" menu.

, Bandicam can record all of the sounds the program you are recording makes, as well as input from a microphone. This can be especially useful if you are recording a tutorial on how to use a program on a computer, or want to include commentary with a game you are playing.


Check the ""Record sound"" box to enable sound recording. Your final file will be larger if you choose to record sound.

, If you want to capture the sounds made by the program you are recording, ensure that the ""Primary Sound Device"" drop-down menu has ""Win8/Win7/Vista Sound (WASAPI)"" selected.


Click the Setting... button to open the Windows sound device settings.

, If you want to use your microphone while you are recording a video, select it from the ""Secondary Sound Device"" drop-down menu.


Check the ""Two Sound Mixing"" box to mix both audio inputs into one track. This will help keep the file size smaller.
You can set a hotkey for the microphone if you only want to record your voice at certain times. Make sure you set the hotkey to a key you don't normally use while using the program you are recording.

, You can change the settings of your video recording to get the best possible quality for your computer. Click the Video tab on the main Bandicam window, and then click the ""Settings"" button in the ""Format"" section.

, By default, this is set to ""Full Size"". This means that the final video will be the same resolution as the original recording. If you are recording a full screen program, the resolution will be the same as that program. If you are recording a window, the resolution will be the size of the window.


If you want, you can change the resolution to a set size. This is useful if you are going to be putting the video on a device that only supports specific resolutions, but may result in stretching and skewing if the resolution is a different ratio than the original recording.

, The FPS of your video is the number of frames that are recorded each second. By default, this is set to 30, which is the maximum FPS currently allowed on YouTube. If you want a higher quality recording, you can increase the FPS.


Higher FPS will result in larger files and will put more strain on your system while recording. You may notice significant performance issues if your computer is not powerful enough to record at a high FPS.

, The codec is the software that processes the video while it is recording. By default, this will be set to Xvid, as this is supported by most systems and devices. You can choose a different codec if your video card supports it.


If you have a high-end Nvidia card, you can choose the ""H.264 (NVENC)"" for the best recording quality. Lower end Nvidia cards can choose the ""H.264 (CUDA)"" option, AMD users can choose ""H.264 (AMP APP)"", and if you are using Intel integrated graphics, you can choose ""H.264 (Intel Quick Sync)"".
If you have multiple video card options (Nvidia and Intel, for example), choose the option that uses your active video card. If your monitor is connected to your motherboard, you will most likely want to choose the Intel codec. If your monitor is connected to an Nvidia or AMD card, choose the codec that matches your card.

, The ""Quality"" drop-down menu allows you to set the general video quality of your recording. These are represented by numbers, with a higher number meaning a higher quality. A higher quality video will mean a larger file, but if you set the quality too low you will lose a lot of clarity and detail.

, If you are recording a tutorial on how to use a program, it may help to highlight your mouse cursor. This will make it easier for your audience to tell what you are doing. Click the ""Settings"" button in the Record section of the main Bandicam interface. Click the Effects tab.


You can enable a click effect that appears every time the left or right mouse buttons are clicked. Click the blank buttons next to each option to set the color.
You can add a highlighter effect to your cursor so that the audience can always see where it is. Click the blank button to set the color. Yellow is one of the most common mouse-highlighting colors, as it stands out and is easy on the eyes.

, This is located at the top of the Bandicam main interface, next to the button depicting a game controller. An outline of the recording window will appear on your screen when you click it.

, Your recording area should completely encompass the window that you want to record. You can click and drag the edges to resize the window, or you can click the dimensions in the top bar to choose from a variety of presets. Everything within the red border of the window will be recorded.

, You can click the REC button in the upper-right corner of your recording window, or click the REC button in the Bandicam main interface. When recording starts, the blue border of the window will change to red, and the timer will start.

, If you want to take a screenshot of your recording at any time, click the Camera icon at the top of the recording window. A screenshot will be taken of what is currently inside the recording window.

, Click the Stop button on either the recording window or the Bandicam main interface to end the recording. You can view your newly-made video by clicking the folder icon in Bandicam. This will open the Output folder, and you can open your new video file in your favorite media player., Clicking this button will change the recording mode to full screen mode, which is designed for capturing gameplay and other full screen programs.

, Bandicam overs an FPS counter overlay that lets you know the FPS your game is running at. This can be useful for determining how much of a performance impact Bandicam has on your game. Click the FPS menu in the Bandicam main interface and ensure that the ""Show FPS Overlay"" box has been checked. You can choose where on the screen you would like the overlay to appear.


It can be very helpful to have the FPS counter enabled, as it changes color to indicate whether you are recording or not.

, In the Video section of the Bandicam interface, you can set the key that will start and stop recording. By default, this is set to F12. You can change this to whatever key you'd like. Make sure that it isn't a key that you use during gameplay.



F12 is the default screenshot key in Steam, meaning that every time you press the key to start or stop a recording, Steam will take a screenshot as well. If you are recording games played through Steam, you might want to change the hotkey.

, Start up the game you want to record as you normally would. You should see the green FPS counter if you have it enabled.

, As soon as you are ready to start recording, press the recording hotkey. You will see the FPS counter change from green to red to indicate that you are currently recording. Your entire screen will be recorded, so make sure you aren't recording any username or login information.

, After you are finished with what you want recorded, press the recording hotkey again to stop the recording process. Your video will be created and placed in the Bandicam output folder. This can be accessed by clicking the folder icon at the top of the Bandicam window.

, Open your output folder and watch the video that you just created. Make sure that it contains everything that you wanted to capture, and that it does not have any excess footage or footage that shouldn't be there. You can open your output folder by clicking the folder icon at the top of the Bandicam window.

, There's a pretty good chance that your new game video is quite large, especially if you were recording for a while. You can lower the size of the video by encoding it using programs such as Handbrake or Avidemux. This will lower the quality of the video but significantly reduce the file size.


Encoding your video can make uploading it to YouTube a much quicker process. If you are planning to burn it to a DVD or just want to keep it on your computer, you can probably leave it as it is.

, Bandicam doesn't have any video effects options, so you can use other programs such as Windows Movie Maker or Sony Vegas to add effects and transitions to your videos. You can insert text cards between scenes, splice together multiple recorded clips, add transitions, credits, and much more.

, YouTube is one of the best places to share your gameplay videos and tutorials. You can even make some money off of them if they get popular enough!


Note that some companies do not allow you to make money off of videos of their products. These restrictions vary from company to company, so it's wise to investigate the specific policy for the game you want to upload.
See this guide for details on uploading videos to YouTube.
See this article for tips on monetizing your videos.

, If you'd rather burn the video to DVD so that you can store it, watch it later, or give it to friends and family, you can easily do so with most DVD burning programs. Burning your video to DVD will allow you to delete it from your computer, saving space. This is specifically good for very large videos. See this guide for details on how to burn a DVD video.

Build the track by adding samples according to rhythm and timing conventions. Through a little bit of trial and error, you should become familiar with how to drag and-drop samples into your track effectively.

, When you have mastered the art of creating the single track, you can use Ableton Live to layer various tracks on top of each other to get a more multi-functional and complex sound.

, When you have a selection of tracks that you feel represent a full sound project, you'll want to use the advanced features of Ableton Live to make the tracks into the best sound combination possible. Features for this use include a volume or amplitude model at the bottom of the screen, as well as individual green dials for each track that are featured prominently in the middle of the screen. Use these to control your various tracks and make your finished project sound better.

, Every box should be filled in before you attempt to verify. Some of these boxes will require you to make a few auditions and do some voice work on-site.

If you absolutely cannot fill in certain boxes (such as not having any previous clients, education, or testimonials), then fill in the boxes anyway with N/A.

Look at the flashcards.,
Complete the ""Speller"" exercise.,
Complete Learn.,
Practice your typing.,
Turn the mode to ""definition"".,
Determine whether the definition is a ""long definition"" or a ""short definition"".,
Look at the keys and type the answer.,
Press Enter.,
Continue and repeat with the next question.,
As mentioned before, determine whether it's a ""long definition"" or a short one.,
For long answers, such as ""Peloponnesian League"", simply copy (using the shortcut Cmd-C or on a PC, Ctr-C).,
If you've messed up an answer, try this.,
If you really don't know the answer, open a new tab or window, then open quizlet and find the answer on the list of terms and definitions.",How to Win Space Race on Quizlet.com," Before you even try to play Space Race, you need to have some basic understanding of the vocabulary.;
, Now that you have some basic understanding, go to speller. It may seem backwards to do Speller before Learn, but the only difference is that Speller says the answer and focuses on just spelling, whereas Learn focuses on both spelling and the right answer. Now you have a better understanding of the terms and how to spell them.

, Now that you can spell and know the terms, try Learn. Once you have completed learn and know the terms like the back of your hand, continue on to part ||.

, Even if you know the terms perfectly, if you can't type, it doesn't matter.

, It's there by default. If it's not there and you have siblings who use the game too, they may have changed it.

, This will help you determine the answer faster. For instance, if you're confused between ""consul"" and ""Julius Caesar"" you can remember that ""consul"" was a two line definition, while ""Julius Caesar"" had a ten line definition.

, Even if you're an excellent typist, you can't afford to make mistakes. Don't take any chances and look at the keys!

, Don't wait until the end, because then you can't type in the answers to other questions.

, You're on your way to victory!

, This will help you choose you answer more quickly, therefore giving you more time to type.

, Then when it comes up, press Cmd or Ctr (the shortcut for paste.) Then, you don't waste your time fretting over how to spell the word quickly.

, When you answer it, the other one will be over the edge, so copy the answer using the above method and after typing in the previous answer, paste. This also works for those times when the definitions stack on top of each other. Simply answer, pause, copy, play, then paste!

, Though some may call this cheating, as long as you re-learn the terms, you're learning still and not cheating.

The Fitbit app can be found in the Windows Store, Google Play Store, or Apple Store.If your device supports Bluetooth, you will need to turn your Bluetooth on before attempting to use your Fitbit account.;
, Once installed, open the app, and from the initial app screen, select ""Join Fitbit."" This will allow you to choose the Fitbit tracker you are using, which you can then confirm you wish to set-up.

, To accurately track things like caloric burn, you will need to supply some information to Fitbit. Follow the instructions and provide the necessary information for your account.

, By providing your name, email, a valid password, and agreeing to terms and services/privacy policy, your account will be created. With that, your account and your dashboard will be set up.

, Keep your tracker close to your device (such as a tablet, phone, or computer). From your device settings, select your Fitbit tracker to pair tracker and device. Now you can return to your Fitbit app and get started.

, You will need to use the wireless sync dongle that came with your Fitbit to do this. Keeping your tracker nearby, plug your dongle into a USB slot. The pairing process should begin automatically.


In the event that your computer has unreliable or spotty Bluetooth, you may be prompted to insert the sync dongle to improve connectivity.
If your tracker does not sync, remove the dongle or restart your tracker and repeat the process.

, The majority of Fitbit trackers will, upon connecting with your computer, provide a four-digit identification code which you will need to enter on your PC when prompted.If you have a Fitbit flex, you will need to tap the device rapidly when you receive the appropriate prompt and then confirm that you felt a vibration, signaling a connection.

, Now you should be able to click ""Next,"" and your tracker will connect through your computer to your Fitbit.com account. After this, you may be prompted to enter a greeting, and then you are ready to go.


It may take a minute or so for your tracker to connect to your account; you should wait patiently during this time.

, You can do this on your phone or PC, but be sure that you have your Bluetooth enabled, your tracker close at hand, and your wireless dongle inserted into a USB port, should you be using a computer without Bluetooth.

, Your Fitbit dashboard will be populated with tiles that help you track your activity, goals, badges, and more. Add tiles by clicking on the Menu icon on the left side of your dashboard (represented by a 9 box, square-shaped icon) and clicking the check box next to the tiles you wish to add., At the top of your dash will be a drop-down menu labeled ""Log,"" under which you should find the ""Food"" option. Now you can fill out your current and desired weight. The following screen will ask you to choose a plan for weight loss.A goal of dropping 250 calories a day is a good start to ease into an exercise routine. If you are ready to burn some serious calories, 1000 calories a day will help you see results much faster.
The dashboard will also ask you to input your food intake, which is necessary for it to track your weight loss and show you your progress.

, Staying hydrated is especially important when exercising.You can record your water intake with your Fitbit by accessing the ""Log"" menu at the top of your screen. Scroll to the bottom of the page where there will be a field where you can input your intake, and clicking ""Log it"" to record the data., You can do this by hovering your mouse over the bottom portion of the tile you wish to remove, clicking the gear icon, and then selecting the trash can icon to remove the tile., You may be perfectly satisfied with the features of the free Fitbit account, but to maximize your understanding of your fitness, nutrition, and personal health, a premium account might be the way to go. The premium account includes: Fitbit Trainer, comparative benchmarking, and Excel exports for body, food, activity, and sleep data.If you'd like to give the premium account a try, there is a 14-day free trial available under the ""Premium"" tab of your dashboard.

, This is a feature available only to premium users. Fitbit Trainer uses your recorded data to create a tailor-made 12-week goal. The trainer will hold you to a high standard, but also takes into consideration whether your goal is too difficult or hard, allowing you to edit your goals after a week has passed., The Fitbit app on your phone does support barcode scanning, and this can make logging the food you eat in your food plan a cinch. Tap the barcode icon where you normally log your food, take a picture of the barcode, and when you see ""Got it,"" the food has been logged.


You may be prompted to add the food you have scanned to the Fitbit food database.
If the food is not recognized, you may have to input your information manually., All kinds of Fitbit trackers are calibrated for walking, running, and general exertion you undergo throughout the day. This does not include activities like biking. For the best accuracy, manually log your activities on your dashboard under the ""Log activity"" icon.Fitbit Surge is the single exception to this limitation, and Surge will take cycling into account when tracking your activity."

On the ""Create Your Profile"" page, fill out all of your personal information as accurately as possible. Once complete, click the ""Submit"" button at the bottom of the page.
Don't forget to enter a goal under the Height and Weight section. If you forget this step, the webpage will ask you to fill it in before you can proceed.
After you've clicked ""Submit"" the website should bring you back to the SuperTracker Home Page that you started out on, but now you should see that you are logged in.;
, Hover over your username and select ""Manage Profile"". The next screen will show your username in a small box near the middle of the screen. Click the ""Edit Profile"" button underneath that.


This screen should look identical to the sign up screen you used originally. Verify that all of your information is correct. This part is especially important because it will influence the calorie suggestions and goals that the SuperTracker gives you.
In the box labeled ""Would you like your SuperTracker plan to help you?"" there is a link to the National Institute of Health's Body Weight Planner. That link will help you decide on an appropriate weight and calorie goal if you need help. As with any diet modification, please consult your doctor before beginning a new diet.
Scroll to the bottom to save any changes that you may have made to your profile.

, If not, just scroll to the top, and click on the ""SuperTracker"" in large text. That will take you back home.

Off to the right of the page there is a box labeled ""My Coach Center."" If you'd like, you can sign up for email reminders that will let you know how you're doing throughout the week and what you still need to do to meet your goals.
While you're still in the My Features section, there is a link at the top labeled My Weight Manager. Click that link and it will bring you to a page where you can update your weight and see a graphical representation of how much weight you've lost.
Right next to the Weight Manager link is another link for My Journal. If you click this link you can enter a food or activity and then write a note to yourself, describe your mood, explain why you chose a certain food. This is beneficial when you want to look back and find out why you missed your goal for the day, or why you did exceptionally well that day.
Be sure to click Save at the bottom before navigating away from this page so you don't lose your journal entry!

,


Scroll back to the top and hover over the ""Track Food & Activity"" drop down menu, and then select Food Tracker.
On the food tracker page, if you scroll down just a little bit, you'll see a search bar. Type in whatever type of food you have eaten that day. Certain foods may be too specific (ex. Chicken Carbonara) so you might need to break it down into the individual ingredients used to make the dish instead of logging it as one item.
After you've typed in a food you've eaten and selected one of the options from the drop down, you can go down to the Food Details box and edit how much of the food you had. When you are satisfied with your entry, you can click Add. After you click Add you should notice that the bar graphs and calorie counts on the page have re-populated with your item added, showing how much you've eaten out of your daily totals and how much remains. Repeat this step for all of the items you eat throughout the day.

, Scroll back to the top and hover over the ""Track Food & Activity"" drop down menu and select My Favorite Foods. Here, you can add any food that you eat frequently, and customize it to your liking so that you can add it to your Food Tracker much easier than adding each individual item. Use the ""Create Combo"" or ""Create Recipe"" buttons to add your specific items and then save them to your favorite foods. This will make tracking your meals much easier. The next two steps cover how to enter things in the My Combo and My Recipe sections.

,


Scroll back to the top and hover over the ""Track Food & Activity"" drop down menu and select My Combo. From there, simply follow the directions at the top of the page labeled ""Build Your Combo in 3 Easy Steps:"" Save your favorite combinations to make tracking your food even easier.

,

Scroll back to the top and hover over the ""Track Food & Activity"" drop down menu and select Physical Activity Tracker.
Once the page loads, you'll notice that the layout mimics the pages where you could enter food. This makes it nice and easy to track your activities. Enter your activities the same way you did for your food.
You'll notice that as you save your activities, the charts to the right will begin to populate with your new data, showing you what you've accomplished today, this week, and how you compare to your goals.
Always make sure you have added your activity before you navigate away from this page. To be sure your activity is saved, simply look at the middle of the page under where it says ""Activities for the Week Of:"" If you don't see your new activity listed next to today's date, go back and re-enter it and be sure to hit ""ADD"". When you see your activity on that list, you are free to navigate to other parts of the site.

, Just like the My Favorite Foods List, the My Favorite Activities List allows you to enter an exercise you anticipate doing frequently to cut down on how much time you have to spend entering it. Simply click on the link for My Favorite Activities List near the top of the page, enter your activity on the next page, and then click Add to Favorite Activity List.

, This feature allows you to view a number of different aspects of your diet and exercise plan, broken up into easy to read sections.


Scroll up to the top of the page and find the link that says My Reports. This will bring you to a page that gives you 6 different options to view (Food Groups & Calories, Nutrients, Food Details, Meal Summary, Physical Activity, and History Charts).
Click on any one of these icons and you will be brought to a page where it will ask you to what information you would like to view. Simply enter the date and the information you would like as the instructions tell you and then select Create Report.
You now have a nice chart showing you calories burned/calories consumed/etc.
In the top right of the report screen, you will also notice that you can export your report as a PDF, Excel file, or Word File in the event you would like to save the data to your home computer.

, With over 8,000 possible foods available in their data, there's little chance of having an item that isn't in their database. Select the ""Food-a-Pedia"" option from the drop-down list at the top of the page or do a quick lookup from the main SuperTracker website. Food-A-Pedia will allow you to compare foods to see which foods you can eat and still be on track for your daily value or within a diet.

Find an interview partner.,
Visit the StoryCorps reservations page.,
Make an appointment at one of the three StoryBooths.,
Alternatively, make an appointment with the mobile tour.,
Have vital information ready when you make your appointment.,
Have a list of questions handy for your appointment.,
Know what to expect at your appointment.",How to Use StoryCorps1," StoryCorps recording sessions are dialogues between a subject and an interviewer. For 40 minutes, the subject talks about an important story from his or her life. Though one person's story is usually the central focus of the recording session, many stories benefit from the relationship and back-and-forth between the two participants, so they're not strictly one-person shows.


If you know someone who has a great story, accompany this person and participate in the interview. If you yourself have a great story, invite someone close who will be able to talk about it with you.;
, Except in special circumstances, interviews are conducted by appointment only. To make an appointment, visit the StoryCorps reservation site located here.


Alternatively, book appointments via a toll-free hotline at 1-800-850-4406. The hotline accepts calls 24/7 and is available in both English and Spanish., StoryCorps operates three permanent recording studios called StoryBooths. These are located in San Francisco, Chicago, and Atlanta. To make an appointment at a StoryBooth on the reservations page, follow these steps:


Select your preferred location from the ""Choose your Recording Locations"" drop-down menu.
Under ""Choose a Date Range,"" pick the earliest and latest possible dates for scheduling your interview.
The list of possible appointments below will change to match your criteria. Click ""Book Now"" next to the most convenient option. Fill out the reservation form on the next page to finalize your appointment.

, Don't live near one of the three StoryBooth locations? You may be able to schedule an appointment at StoryCorps' mobile recording studio, which travels to various locations throughout the country. If you're interested in finding the mobile tour, select ""Mobile Tour"" from the list of location options and follow the rest of the instructions above as normal.


For information on the mobile tour (including a schedule of upcoming stops), visit the tour page here., This will make for a quick and easy reservation process. You'll want to have:Your name and contact information
Your interview partner's name and contact information
Your preferred date and time for your interview
Payment information for a valid credit card. You will only be charged if you cancel within 48 hours of your appointment (the cancellation fee is $50).

, 40 minutes goes by quickly once you start talking, so you won't want to waste any recording time on dead air.


In general, emotional, open-ended questions usually get the most personal results. Asking ""how did that make you feel?"" as opposed to ""and then what happened?"" will make for a deeper, richer conversation.
If you're having a hard time thinking of questions, visit the StoryCorps question generator, which has great conversation-starters for every occasion.

, Arrive at the recording location on time. You will be greeted by a StoryCorps Facilitator, who will explain the process and help you get started. You should expect:A brief introduction/sound check/set up before the interview (about 15 minutes total).
A long, mostly uninterrupted dialog between yourself and your partner (about 40 minutes total). It is absolutely OK to express strong emotions here; laughter and tears are a common experience.
After your interview session, you'll be given a CD copy of your interview and have your picture taken.

Search for a variety of professional networking sites.,
Complete your profile.,
Add your friends.,
Introduce yourself.,
Explore different groups.,
Ask questions in forums and Q&A sessions.,
Keep your profile updated.",How to Use Professional Networking Web Sites,"
The point of networking is to meet a wide range of people who share your interests; therefore, don’t limit yourself by joining only one professional networking Web site. You want your business network to continuously grow, so why not join a few sites? However, keep in mind that you must be able to maintain a sufficient activity level on each site you join. For that reason, don’t create more accounts than you can regularly manage.;
,
Once you create an account, don’t just stop there. Take the time to create a good profile that will appropriately promote your business or you as a professional. Be informative and thorough. After all, other users will develop their first impressions of you or your business based on your profile. So, whether or not they add you to their network will depend on if they like what they see.

,
If you know some people who are members of the business networking site(s) you just joined, add them to your contact list. The people you already know are your gateway. Through them, you can make new connections and further develop your business network.

,
The success of your business network is in your hands. If you see someone you would like to make contact with, introduce yourself and request to be added to their network. There’s no benefit in waiting for them to make the first move.

,
Joining the right groups can help you meet the right people. Take the time to research a number of groups. Read forum comments to get a grasp of what the group is about. If members of the group share your interests, then join the group. Belonging to groups will not only help you get noticed, but it will also provide you with the opportunity to introduce yourself to the users you are interested in meeting.

,
Participating in forums or Q&A sessions does not mean simply providing your insights. Although responding to other people’s comments or questions is a great way to interact with others and develop new relationships, asking questions is also important. Voicing your inquiries invites people to converse with you, whether they have an answer to your questions or are awaiting a response to similar questions.

,
Always make sure the information on your profile is up-to-date. This especially applies to your contact information. It is also a good idea to freshen up your content from time to time and/or start a blog. New content gives other users a reason to revisit your profile.

,How to Use Google Maps1,
"
Type the location's address into the search bar.,
Alternatively, enter the name of the location.,
To find many different locations, use general search terms.,
Zoom in and out to view your results.,
Click on each result to get information on it.",How to Use Google Maps2," When you launch Google Maps, you should see a map (if your device can detect your current location, this will be of the surrounding area) and a text bar near the top of the screen. To find where an address is, simply type it in, using as much detail as you can, and hit enter or press the magnifying glass button.


For example, if you want to find 123 Main Street in Appleton, California, you'd type exactly that into the search bar: 123 Main Street, Appleton, CA. Adding the zip code if you know it can help Google Maps find the place you're looking for, but you often won't need it.;
, If the place you're looking for has a name (for instance, if it's a business, a public building, a well-known landmark, etc.), you usually won't have to put in its address. Instead, just type in its name (or, if you can't remember it, your best guess) and press enter or click the magnifying glass. You can also add the city, state, and country if desired to get a more specific search.


For example, if you want to find the local library, you might type in something like: Norman Library Appleton, CA.


, Sometimes, you may not know exactly where you need to go because you have many different choices (for instance, if you're deciding on a place to get dinner.) In this case, try to describe what you're looking for in general terms in the search bar. You can include the city, state, and so on if you're looking in a specific area.


For example, if you're looking for a place to get your car fixed, you might type in something like: Car mechanics Appleton, CA.


, If your search brings up a single result, the map will move to display it and it will be marked with a dot. If your search brings up more than one result, the map will move to display some or all of them and each result will be marked with its own dot. In either case, you can zoom in and out to get a smaller or bigger picture of the location of your result(s). To do this:



Browser: Use the +/- buttons in the bottom right or scroll with the middle mouse button.

Mobile: Make a pinching motion with two fingers on the screen to zoom out. Reverse this motion to zoom in.

, If you get multiple results, clicking on any of the dots marked on the map should bring up the information that Google Maps has on it. Depending on the type of location you're viewing, you may or may not see the following information:


Opening/closing times
Reviews
Links to official websites

Find your destination.,
Click ""Directions."",
If necessary, type in your starting point.,
If you get multiple routes, pick the one you like best.,
View your directions.,
Switch transportation modes with the icons at the top.",How to Use Google Maps3," One of the most useful features of Google Maps is that it allows you to get detailed, step-by-step directions to almost any place you can find in the world. To get directions, start by finding the place you want to go. You can do this with either its name or address — see the section above for greater detail.

, When you find your destination, look in the information panel that pops up for a button that says ""Directions"" and has an icon that looks like a fork in a road. Click this to continue.



Mobile: On mobile devices, instead, simply click the car icon in the bottom right that has a time value under it (e.g., 10 min., 1 hr 30 min., etc.)

, If your device can detect where you currently are, it will automatically give you directions from your location to the destination you've chosen. If it can't, you need to type your starting point into the text box that appears next to your destination.

, Often, Google Maps will offer you more than one route from the starting point you choose to your destination. For each route, it will display an estimated time for the trip and a short description of the route (e.g., ""via I-880 North""). Pick the route from the list that is most appealing to you. This may be the shortest one, the one that avoids highways, or something else entirely — it's up to you.

, To see the directions for the route you've chosen, do the following:



Browser: Select the route from the list, then click ""Details"" to see your directions. Click each item in the list of directions to expand or collapse it so you can see the directions in greater detail. Use the printer button at the top of the directions to print.

Mobile: Press ""Start Navigation"" for the route you want. Google Maps will begin to give you directions in real time. In other words, as you make each turn, it will update you with the next turn you'll need to make. Click the tab at the bottom of the screen at any time to see a complete list of directions.

, By default Google Maps finds directions for car traffic. If you're not traveling via car, you can still get accurate directions for your mode of transportation. As you are choosing the route you want, use the small icons at the top of the screen that look like different modes of transportation to get different types of directions. Your options are:


Car
Public transportation (looks like a train)
Walking
Bicycle
Plane (Browser only; for long-distance trips)

Finding businesses near a given location on Google Maps is easy. To start, just find this location with the search bar with its name or address.

, When you find your location, the standard information panel should appear. Look for the small link that says ""Search nearby"" in this panel (it's underneath text that says ""Explore this area."")



Mobile: On mobile, instead of using a ""Search nearby"" feature, you can just click once on the map to de-select your location. Any searches you make after this will be in the area surrounding the part of the map you're viewing.

, Now, you just need to describe what you're looking for to get a list of relevant results. When possible, your query should be written in the plural (e.g., ""restaurants,"" ""barbers,"" etc.)



Mobile: With your location centered in the map, clear the search bar and type in your query.

Figure out what you have to change to appeal directly to children.,
Develop some children's mascots or characters that speak to your corporate message but are something with which kids can identify.,
Determine the focus of your kids' section.,
Plan out your site's navigation.",How to Set Up a Kids' Section on a Website1," Some things to consider are your logo and color scheme.


For branding purposes, you'll just want to modify what you've already got rather than changing it completely. If your logo has any hard edges, try creating a new one that has rounded edges and looks either softer or shinier, or a combination of both.;
, If your logo translates easily into a mascot, that is your best choice from a branding perspective.


Does your business name or actual industrial field have to do with animals? Animals are a great children's mascot. Another good option is a cartoon child who ""works"" in your particular industry. That way your message can be delivered on a child's level and feel more like a friend than a sales pitch. Keeping a children's mascot focused on your industry is key to maintain branding.

, Your focus should either be to simply reinforce brand awareness or market specific products or services.


If your focus is simply to create brand awareness with kids, create activities like puzzles, coloring and games that reinforce your branding and message. Make sure your logo and name are featured on anything a child can print out and share. If your focus is to market a specific product or service, highlight benefits and features with your children's mascot. Also consider anonymous market research with quizzes that give kids access to more entertainment on your site.

, Navigation is critical to the success of any website, but most especially one focused on children. Navigation buttons should be easy to use and understand.

"
"
Create special offers or incentives to get children to get their parents involved in your site.,
Check your email delivery rates, open rates and click-through rates with every campaign to determine which are successful or what needs to be tweaked.

,
Analyze your site analytics to find out if your kids' section is easy enough to navigate and if kids are actually going to more than just your main page.",How to Set Up a Kids' Section on a Website2," Free giveaways that are kid-oriented can convince kids to get their parents to sign them up, which gets you that all-important contact lead information.


A kids' club is a way to make special offers for children directly to their parents. Send the offer to the parents but make sure to have something on your site that lets the kids know their parents got something special for them because they're part of your kids' club. If your business is not child-oriented, make sure to let parents know that, too.

,, If you have a high bounce rate for your main page, try tweaking your navigation.

Write down the name and password somewhere where you'll remember it, like the notepad for instance; you may need to log into this email address when it becomes time to cancel your account., Netflix requires a different credit card for each free trial, but will not charge you any money during the trial. Turn some cash into a prepaid credit card from a gas station or supermarket, or get a virtual card online. Enter the information during trial sign up, then use the money on the card for your ordinary purchases.


Always read the fine print before purchasing a card. Many of these cards charge fees for all sorts of activities., Go to the Netflix website and click Start Your Free Month. Select your preferences and input the information associated with your new email address and prepaid card.


If you want to set up Netflix on another device, select that device while signing up and follow the instructions. You'll need to set up the Netflix application and new account on each console, Apple TV, Roku or Blu-Ray player.

, You must cancel the account before the end of the month in order to avoid payment. To do this, while logged in to Netflix, click your account name in the top right, select Your Account, then select Cancel Streaming Plan &/or Cancel DVD Plan. Follow the prompts to complete the cancellation.


In some cases, you will be able to continue watching until the end of the month.

, If you use a different credit card and email address each time, Netflix should let you receive a free trial repeatedly. This is shady territory at best as far as Netflix's terms of service goes, so consider paying the full price once you've got a chance to try Netflix to your satisfaction.If you make a PayPal account and connect your already-used prepaid card to it, you can get a second month of Netflix with the same card, by entering your PayPal information instead.Keep in mind that PayPal may shut down accounts with fake information."

Get on a friend's streaming account.,
Get a job at Netflix.",How to Get Netflix For Free2," With Netflix's massive popularity in countries where it is available, it shouldn't be too hard to find someone with an existing Netflix account that will let you share the online streaming portion of the service. While sharing an account password outside your household is not a violation of the terms of service, you and the account owner should be aware of these limitations:The account owner is responsible for all activity on the account.
There can only be 5 profiles on each account (used to determine recommendations and favorites), and only 2 of these can stream from more than one device at a time.
Local or state law can make this illegal – this is true in Tennessee – but Netflix is considered unlikely to pursue these violations to a court, if you cooperate after being discovered.

, Most likely, you don't love Netflix enough to switch careers for a free account. However, once in a long while, Netflix puts out the call for what many people consider a dream job position: a part-time tagger. If you get hired as a tagger, you'll spend your workday watching Netflix content and deciding which genre and description to label it as. If you're a film buff, it could be worth bookmarking jobs.netflix.com or following them on Twitter @NetflixJobs.

If you want to subscribe to the Netflix DVD delivery service in the US, visit dvd.netflix.com. The sign up process is very similar to the streaming service.;
, All memberships start with a one month trial. It will require entering in payment information, but if you cancel your membership within the first month you will not be charged.

, Creating an account simply requires entering your email address and creating a password. You can also create an account using your Facebook account, which can be useful if you're trying to keep your online accounts to a minimum.

, There are three streaming plans that you can choose from:


Cheapest - Watch on one screen at a time in SD quality.
Regular - Watch on two screens in HD quality
Premium - Watch on four screens in HD quality.
With the more expensive plans, you can share your Netflix information with friends and family and they can watch at the same time that you are (this is not technically allowed by Netflix, but is a common practice).
Not all content is available in HD. There is very limited content available in Ultra HD.

, You will need to enter your credit card and billing information. You can also use PayPal to pay. You need to enter a valid card, as Netflix will charge after the trial period is complete.

As you continue picking titles to watch later on, Netflix will adjust your recommendations, so don't worry too much about what you pick right now.


Use the Netflix DVD website to set the order that you want to receive your DVDs in. You can adjust the list and add new titles whenever you'd like. When you send a DVD back, the next DVD on the list will be sent to you.

, You can log into the Netflix website and watch directly from your computer. Use the search bar to find specific titles, or browse the different categories. You can use any web browser. You will be prompted to install the Microsoft Silverlight plugin if it is not installed already.


If you are trying to watch Netflix from a region that doesn't support it, click here.

The process varies from device to device, but generally you will just need to download the Netflix app and log in with your account.

Make sure that the sound quality is good enough to hear.,
Download a editing program.,
Edit.,
Upload your video to YouTube, making sure you give a good video title, description, and tags.,
Keep uploading.",How to Create Good Videos on YouTube," This is very important. There are good HD cameras available for around $250. However, some smartphones have really good quality cameras on them. The LG G4, for example, has an excellent quality camera.;
, This is more important than video. The typical viewer can stand a lousy video camera but if they can't hear you, they'll probably click off your video. You can buy an OK microphone for around 15-30 bucks. However, if you're looking for excellent audio on a budget, consider investing in a microphone in the $100-$200 range, i.e. the Rode VideoMic.

, This will improve your video quality by making your video less noisy. Make sure your room (or wherever you're filming) is full of lights. For a tutorial on how to get good lighting, search on YouTube or Google.

, Don't simply film something without having an idea of what you want it to be about and explain to the audience; unless you're very talented, making it up as you go will not sound very convincing as you film.

, Try to make your content original and funny, as it will help you retain your audience. Talk about something that interests you. This could be a news story, your opinion on something, or even about your hobby. You could also make some comedy skits with your friends.

, Make your videos short. One to three minutes is good (especially when starting out). Remember that most people on YouTube get bored fast. If they don't like what they see in the first 5-10 seconds they'll leave the video, so draw them in fast.

, This is a must! Ask your audience to like your videos or subscribe to your channel to get more updates. Annotations are handy tools for this.

, Make sure you set it up in a location with good lighting. Lighting can be improved easily by YouTube's lighting correction feature.

, Using the correct settings in Movie Maker, you can make your video into a HD video. Just google it to find the correct settings.

, Jump cuts help, but can draw the viewer away from the video if used too often. Most of the top YouTubers use them. However, if you are going for more of a professional look, try to avoid jump cuts.

, Think of it this way. If you find that the microphone on your camera doesn't pick up the sound sufficiently, buy an external microphone.

, This is what you are going to use to put all of your footage together and make it look and sound better.


A good free editing program to use is one that comes built into all Windows machines - Windows Movie Maker. It allows you to easily edit your own video. And if you're on Mac, you can just use iMovie!
If your looking for a more high end solution, you can use Sony Vegas if you use Windows, and for Mac you can get Final Cut Pro X. Please note that you will need to pay for both of these programs.

, Load all your clips into your computer and into your editing program. Make sure your editing is nice and smooth before posting on YouTube.


The utilization of titles and cool effects really makes a difference. Don't use too many, though, or viewers will click off your video.
As stated previously, using excess jump cuts can draw viewers away from your video.

, This is what users are going to use to find your videos and even get you some views, depending on how good the title description, and the tags are.

, Don't stop uploading new content. That is how you grow your subscribers.


Ensure quality over quantity. It is better to have 10 great videos than 10,000 lousy videos.

, Open a new tab or browser window and type “YouTube to MP3 converter” into your search engine’s search field. Your search will likely return many websites. The MP3 quality may differ depending on which site you use, but you should be able to find something decent for free. As these sites are constantly changing, it's best to search current reviews when choosing which site to use.


If a site asks you to pay for the service, it might even be a scam; you’re better off just trying another site that doesn’t charge.
Be careful when choosing a conversion site that you don’t wind up on a scam site. Before going to the site, do an online search of the site’s name to see if any negative search results come up.Another thing you can do if you’re unsure of how to tell whether a site is safe, is to type “https://google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=“ into your browser, followed by the web address of the site you’re considering opening., Once you’ve chosen which conversion website you'll use, open it up and paste your YouTube video’s URL into the relevant field — exactly where this field is and how it looks will differ depending on the website, but it should be pretty obvious.

For example, if you use Safari, type “YouTube to MP3 browser extension Safari” into your search engine.

, You will likely have a lot of extensions to choose from — many of them will be free. Extensions may vary in ease of use, MP3 quality, and the level of privacy (i.e. lack of spyware) they provide. To ensure that you’re choosing a high-quality and reputable extension, search its name plus “reviews” to see what other users have said about it.


Ultimately you’ll want something that will not slow down your browser too much, and that won’t place any malware or unwanted software on your computer.
Signs that you’ve downloaded malware include pop-up ads and spam; your home page changing to a site you don’t recognize; and being redirected to unfamiliar pages., Many browser extensions have multiple versions to suit different browsers. Ensure that you download the correct extension for your browser — this includes ensuring that your browser version is compatible with the extension.


The process for checking your browser version will differ depending on which operating system (i.e. Windows, Mac or Linux) and which browser you're using. If you are unsure of how to check your browser version, type “how to check <browser name> version <operating system name>” into your search engine.For example, with Safari on a Mac, you would ensure that you have a browser window open, then click on the word “Safari” in the upper left corner of your desktop, next to the apple icon. This would open a drop-down menu, and you would choose the first option, “About Safari,” from the menu, which would then open a small pop-up window with the browser details — including the version number.

, Clicking “download” on the extension page will start the installation process. Specific extensions will have slightly different installation processes, so just follow the installation wizard.


You may need to restart your browser once you’ve finished installing the extension, so ensure that you’ve bookmarked or otherwise noted any webpages you have open that you would like to return to.

, The plugin should now show up somewhere around the video — it will likely appear above or below the video, but some extensions also appear in the upper right-hand corner of the video.


If you have any difficulty finding the extension, go to the extension site (from which you downloaded the extension) and read the instructions/look at screenshots to see where the extension buttons should show up on your YouTube video page.

, Click on the extension button to convert the video to MP3. This will download an MP3 file from the video on to your computer.

, Unless you’ve specified otherwise, the extension will likely download the MP3 file into your computer’s “Downloads” folder, but this isn’t always the case.


If you’re unsure of where the file will go, consult your extension’s instruction page. A good extension should have a solid help page.

, Once you’ve downloaded the MP3 file you should be able to open it and listen to it in a media player (for example, Windows Media Player or iTunes) and/or add it to your music library.

Signs that you’ve downloaded malware include pop-up ads and spam; your home page changing to a site you don’t recognize; and being redirected to unfamiliar pages., There will likely be several different versions of the software to suit different operating systems. Ensure that you download the correct version of the software for your operating system.


You’ll also want to make sure that the software is compatible with your operating system version. If you're unsure of how to check which operating system version you're using, type “how to check <operating system name> version” into your search engine.
For example, to check which Mac operating system you’re using, click on the apple icon in the upper left-hand corner of your desktop. This will open a drop-down menu, from which you will choose the first option: “About this Mac.” A small pop-up window will then open that lists details about your computer, including which operating system (OS X) and version you’re using.

, Clicking “download” on the software website will start the installation process. Each program will have a different installation process, so just follow the installation wizard.


During the download process you may be prompted to download other software or toolbars that are not part of the conversion software. You likely don’t want these on your computer. Usually you can avoid downloading them by simply unchecking the checkboxes during installation.
You may need to restart your computer once you’ve finished installing the conversion software, so ensure that you’ve saved everything you want to save before beginning the installation.

, The conversion software will likely offer you a few options for your download. The higher the quality, the larger the file, meaning it will take up more space on your computer’s hard drive — on the other hand, it will also likely sound better.


You can always go back and download a higher-quality version of the file by simply repeating the download process and selecting a higher quality. Don’t be afraid to experiment with file sizes to find what works best for you.

, Some conversion programs will automatically fill in song details such as artist, song title, album, and release date. Check to ensure that these are correct before you click the “download” or “convert” button on your conversion program.

, MP3 files will generally be downloaded by default into your “Music” folder. Double-check that the MP3 file will go where you want it to go by viewing the conversion program’s “preferences” or “tools > options” folder, and ensuring that the “output” is saved to a folder of your choosing.

, Once you’ve chosen your file, quality settings, and download folder you're ready to download the video. The conversion program will download the video from YouTube and then convert it to an MP3 file. The whole process shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, unless you’re downloading something much longer than a single song — for example, an hour-long presentation.

, Once it’s been downloaded, you’ll be able to find your MP3 file in your previously specified folder. You can then play the file using a media player (for example, Windows Media Player or iTunes) and/or add it to your music library.

This will help you figure out what cables you need, and if it is even possible. If you have the ability to use any of the above methods, you'll likely have a better experience using that instead.

Most newer laptops have an HDMI output along the back or side. This is the easiest way to connect your laptop to your TV, as long as your TV has HDMI as well, and only requires a single HDMI cable.
Your laptop may have a DVI output on the back. This looks like an older monitor port, with a line or ""+"" on the right side. If your TV also has a DVI port, you can use a DVI-to-DVI cable. If your TV doesn't have a DVI port, you'll need an adapter that will convert the DVI to HDMI. You'll also need a separate audio cable.
If your laptop has a blue VGA port, you may be able to connect to a VGA port on your TV. Many newer TVs do not have VGA ports. VGA will result in a blurry image, especially on newer HDTVs. You'll also need a separate audio cable.
If you're using a Macbook, you'll likely need an adapter in order to connect to an HDMI TV. Most Macbooks come with a Thunderbolt port which you can convert into an HDMI signal.;
, Once you've determined how to best connect your laptop, connect it to an open port on your TV.

If you're connecting via DVI or VGA, you should start with your laptop and TV turned off. This isn't an issue if you're using HDMI.

, If you're connecting using DVI or VGA, you'll need a separate audio cable to get audio from your laptop to your TV. The audio input port on your TV will have the same label as the DVI or VGA port that you connected the laptop to. You'll need a cable that splits the single output of the laptop's headphones port to the stereo input on your TV., Select the input that your laptop is connected to., Depending on your laptop's settings, you may see the image appear automatically when you log into Windows., If you don't see an image on your TV, you can tell your laptop to output to your TV.

Just pick your accompanying task or chore carefully, to make sure it's nothing that will distract you too much from the show, or vice versa.

Click Manage Profiles and you'll be taken to the settings described below. Once you make a change, it should apply to all devices, although you may need to restart them before they take effect.

, Create a new profile for each member of your household (up to five profiles) by clicking Add Profile and entering a name. Netflix will now prompt you to select a profile each time you log in, and keep your ratings and viewing history for that profile separate from all the other profiles.


Profiles are not password protected, so they are easy to switch between. This method is great for maintaining useful ""Recently Watched"" lists that only include what you personally watched, but it is not a reliable way to hide information if your family looks for it.

, Before you watch a show you wish to keep private, create a new profile by clicking Add Profile or the large plus sign next to it. Once you are done watching, return to the profile management page and click Edit next to the temporary profile's name, then Delete Profile. Click Delete Profile again in the popup message to confirm that this is intentional.


Note that you can only have five profiles active at a time.

, This will remove all your ratings and ""My List"" content, so be certain you don't want any of your old content to survive before you take this step. Create a new profile using the Add Profile button, then delete your old profile.

, Click Edit next to a profile for your child. The word Adults should now become a drop-down list. You can select Teens, Older Kids, or Little Kids, then click Done to save the change. Anyone using that profile will now see only movies and shows appropriate for that age, as determined by national rating systems and Netflix's own judgement.There is no way to password-protect a profile, so it is still possible for a kid to log onto another person's profile and watch mature content there.
In Germany, but in no other country, you can also create a password that must be entered before viewing mature (FSK-18) movies and shows."

Post quality content.,
Tell friends and family.",How to Grow a YouTube Channel (Audience)," Before you just go ahead and create a channel and start posting videos, think and act. Choose a suitable name for your channel and a unique one. Think of what videos you'll be posting. It should be something you love to do, not something you don't like or don't know much about.;
, Don't expect to get 1000 subscribers in just a day or a week. Growing a YouTube channel is a very tough and slow process. Sometimes it can even take years to fetch you a decent amount of viewers (depending on how good you are).

, Make sure you are being yourself. No matter what videos you upload, it has to be you. Don't let your videos be dry and dull. Post interactive videos where you can talk to your audience and they can talk to you back. Think of it as a community. Post your own original ideas and not copies, because if you post copies your audience might have already seen them and your channel will be no use to them. Think fresh and original, and at a few places...try to be funny.

, It's the internet so there is a 55% chance of haters trying to bring your hopes down. If you think you are good...then you are! Don't listen to people who try to bring down your channel. The best thing to do is just ignore.

, Don't just go ahead and post dull videos. Post videos which at least have a good quality (360-780 is good enough). Quality also refers to how bright your videos are. Never let them be dull and have no meaning. Post videos which will keep your viewers interested and to come back and eventually...Subscribe!

, Tell friends and family about your channel. Don't feel shy. Just put yourself out there. Chances are they can spread the news.

Watch the video.",How to Make a Lyric Video for YouTube," You will need some sort of video editing program in order to create this video. This program should allow you to import songs, add backgrounds, and add text. Although the following methods will focus on iMovie and Windows Live Movie Maker, you can apply the outlined techniques to other video editing programs as well.

Consider buying software, or at least downloading a program from a reputable company. Many companies offer free trial versions that expire within 30-90 days, free (simplified) versions, and full versions that cost more money, but allow you to use more features.
Avoid downloading free programs from second-party and questionable websites. The free program that you download may not be worth the loads of free viruses and Trojans that might come with it.;
, Make sure that the song is saved as an audio file onto your computer. If you don't already own the file, download it from a reputable website or copy it from a CD. Make sure to use a file with decent sound quality. If it sounds static-y, scratchy, or fuzzy, try another copy of the song.

Be wary of downloading any free music. Not only is the artist not getting any money, but that free music file might also come with a free virus or Trojan.

, Some programs automatically use a YouTube-compatible aspect ratio, and most allow you to adjust the ratio.

If your video editing program doesn't let you set a YouTube-compatible aspect ratio, try giving your lyric video a black background. This way, the black filler bars will be less noticeable., Consider using a solid color for your background so that the text stands out – especially if the song is fast-paced and wordy. Try to use contrasting colors so that the text is easier to read.

If you want to use an image as your background, try fading the colors. Alternately, use an image for the title screen, and switch to a solid color once the lyrics start.
Consider the song's mood and theme when choosing colors and images. Use darker colors for a sad song, and brighter colors for a happy song. If the song is about loneliness, consider using images that feel lonely, such as empty parks or fields.
If your background is black, use white for the text. If your background is mostly blues, consider using a warm color, such as pink, or a contrasting color such as orange. If you want to use light/dark colors for both your text and background, consider outlining the text in a dark/light color., You want the words to be easy to read. If your text is too fancy or too small, your viewers might not be able to read the lyrics. Try using a simple font like Ariel or Calibri. Use a large font size so that the words fill the screen. Stay away from very thin font styles, as well as those with close-knit kerning. This will make them more difficult to read.
Don't be afraid to change your font style throughout the video to reflect the mood of certain parts – but don't go too wild. For the sake of consistency, try to stick to 1-3 fonts: vary the size as needed, or pick a bold font, a plain font, and a fancier font.

, If the song has a very quick tempo, you may want to put an entire stanza on each slide so that people can read all of the words as they're being sung. If it's a slow song, try putting each line on a separate slide to reflect the pacing., The title page gives credit to the original artist, and it confirms that the viewer is watching the video that he/she wants to watch. The title page should include the name of the song and the name of the artist. Consider adding the name of the album, especially if you want this video to become part of a full-album playlist.

Consider adding your own name. If you are doing this for a school project or trying to build the ""brand"" of your YouTube channel, you may want to credit yourself for making the video. You can use your real name, your YouTube username, or both.
Consider leaving the video silent during the title page by making the video slightly longer than the song track. This might make the transition cleaner.

, Once you have opened iMovie, you can set up your movie by clicking on ""File"" and then selecting ""New Event"" from the drop-down menu. Name your event whatever you want, such as a variation of the song title. This is where you will be importing the song and background image that you'll be using in your video., Click on ""File"" again and select ""Import Media"" from the drop-down menu. A new window will pop up. From here, click on the song you want to use for your video, and the image you want for your background. Once you have everything you want selected, click on ""Import."" Your song and image should now be in your Event. You are now ready to start creating your video!, You can start creating a new video by going to the top of the window and clicking on ""Create."" Choose ""Movie"" for the project type, and ""No Template"" for the template. Make sure that the video is being saved in your Event.

You will also be asked to name the video. You can choose whatever name you want, but some variation of the song title might help you find the video later on.

, You can do this by clicking on the image and dragging it over to the project pane. It will be automatically set to 4 seconds, so you will need to extend the length., In order to do this, go back to your project pane and click on the image. At the top of the window, click ""Adjust,"" and then ""Clip Information."" This will allow you to change the duration of the background from 4 seconds to however long the song is – or however long you want your final video to be.

If you don't do this, the background will appear only for 4 seconds, and then disappear.
Do not leave the adjustment window just yet!

, When you add a background image to an iMovie project, the program will automatically apply a panning-and-zooming motion to the picture. If you like this effect, feel free to leave it – but make sure that you at least know how to get rid of it. In the adjustment window, click ""Crop,"" and then select ""Fit."" This will clear away any unwanted image motion., First, open the Event Browser. Double-click your song, and drag it to the bottom of the project pane. If you want the song to start right away, place it all the way to the left. If you do not want it to start right away, then leave a bit of space in the beginning.

If you have a ""title page,"" for instance, you might want the viewer to have a chance to read the name of the song and the band before the music begins.

, You can select a font style by going to the bottom left corner of the screen and selecting the Content Library. Click on ""Titles."" If you can't find the Content Library, click on ""Window"" and select ""Show Libraries."" You will see many different titles. Hover your mouse pointer over each one to see what it does. Click on the one you like., Click on Play, and wait until the person starts singing. When the person starts singing, hit Stop. Click on the ""title"" and drag it to the stopping point on the time line. Then, click on the title again, and select the text in the preview pane. Type out the first line or two of the song., You can do this by playing the song and seeing where the first sung ling (the one you just typed out) ends. Hit Stop and look where the play-head rests. Drag the right border of the title so that it matches with the play-head.

If the lyrics start too late, you can make them appear sooner by dragging the title to the left.

, Once you are happy with the placement and timing of your first line, you can add the next line. Do this by clicking and dragging the play-head to where next set of lyrics begins. Repeat steps 9 and 10. Keep doing this until the song is complete and you have written all of the lyrics., Once the song is complete and you have typed out all of the lyrics, press Play and watch your video. You may find that you have to adjust the timing of the lyrics. If this happens, simply click on the title you want to adjust, and drag it left or right., Once you are satisfied with your video, click ""Share,"" and select ""File"" from the drop-down menu. You will be asked to name your file and choose a location for it to be saved in. Type in a name for your video and choose a location that you will remember (you will need to access this location later when you are uploading your video to YouTube) then click on ""Save.""

Make sure to use a YouTube-compatible file type: 3GPP, AVI, .FLV, .MOV, MP4, .MPEG4, .MPEGPS, WebM, or .WMV., If you don't have it, you will have to download it from the Microsoft website. Avoid downloading the program from a second-party website, as it may come with viruses., To add a background to your video, click on the Home tab, and select the button that says ""Add videos and photos."" Go to the folder where you keep your images and select the one you want. Your player on the left will now contain the background you chose, and the storyboard on the right will contain a thumbnail version of the background., You want your background to last throughout the video, and there are two ways you can achieve this: you can either do it manually by copy-pasting the image or you can let the program do it automatically for you. If one way doesn't work, try the other one.

You can copy-paste the thumbnail image all the way to the right side of the screen, then select the whole line, and copy-paste it several times. This should be enough to cover the whole song.You can also add your song first, and then select the ""Project"" tab, and click on ""Fit to Music."" This will cause your background to stretch from the beginning all the way to the end., To add music to your video, click on the Home tab, and select the button that says ""Add Music."" A new window will pop up. Select the song you want from the list. Once you have added your song, you should see a green bar right above the background thumbnails.

If you do not see your song in the pop-up, go to the folder where you keep your music, and select it from there.

, If you extended the background manually, the green song bar may stop before the background thumbnails do, or it may extend past the thumbnails. If this happens, you may need to extend the background, or shorten it.If the green bar stops before the last thumbnail, your background is longer than your song. Look to see where the green bar stops, and delete any backgrounds after it.
If the green bar extends past the green bar, your background is not long enough. You will need to copy-paste the background thumbnails until the green bar no longer extends past it.

, You can add words to your video by opening the Home tab and selecting ""Caption."" When you select ""Caption,"" you will be able to start typing words directly into your video screen. You can adjust the length of the Caption by clicking on it in your storyboard, then selecting ""Caption"" from the ""Home"" tab. You'll see two places where you can input numbers: start time and text duration. Adjust the ""text duration,"" and type in the number of seconds you want your title page to last.

You can add more Captions by clicking on the next thumbnail.

, Now that you know how to add text to your video, you will need to add the lyrics and time them to the words in the song. You can do this by first clicking on Play in the player, and letting the music start. When you hear the person start singing, press stop. Note what background image it is where the person starts singing. Then, add the lyrics.

Don't write all of the lyrics at once. Instead, write the first line or two, and then add another Caption for the next few lines.

, Once you are satisfied with your video, open up the File menu (or click on the very first tab) and click on ""Save As."" You will be asked to choose a name and file type for your video. You can select a location for your document to be saved in from the menu on the left. Choose a name, file type, and location for your video. Then, click ""Save.""

Be sure to save the video in a file format that's accepted by YouTube: 3GPP, AVI, .FLV, .MOV, MP4, .MPEG4, .MPEGPS, WebM, or .WMV.

, Open https://www.youtube.com/. If you are already signed into your account, click ""Upload"" in the upper right-hand corner. Drag the video file into the ""Upload"" box in the center of the next screen, and your lyric video will automatically upload.

If you don't have an account yet, click the red ""Create an Account"" button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Follow the instructions to create a YouTube account.If you want anyone to be able to watch your lyric video, make sure that the ""Public"" option is selected, rather than ""Private"" or ""Unlisted."" Choose ""Public"" from the drop-down menu directly beneath the large grey arrow.

, When you upload your video to YouTube, you will be asked to add a description, title, and tags. Fill out all three options before publishing your video. Once you have chosen a name and description for your video, and added some tags: click on ""Publish.""

The video description should include the name of the song, the artist or band, and the album. You can also include who is doing the vocals and instrumentals. Be sure to mention that you made the video!
The title of your video should include the name of the song and the artist. Consider including ""with lyrics"" in your title so that people will know that this is a lyric video.
The tags should include the name of the song, artist, band, and genre. Consider using the ""lyrics"" tag.

, Once you've uploaded your video to YouTube, watch it through to make sure that you're satisfied. If something isn't right, you can always take the video down, tweak it, and re-upload it."

, This is important! You can choose multiple genres, like uploading EDM genres or electronic music, uploading all types of rock music, and so on. You can also stick to one genre (like dubstep), or choose the mood of your songs, like uploading relaxing or uplifting music only. You can also upload free songs, film songs, meditation music, and many others. Choose wisely!

, For happy songs try adding happy, colorful pictures like a landscape, clouds, or anything you like, but for atmospheric stuff choose darker, paler colors, like an abandoned street, a forest or even black-white photos. You can either add digitally painted, photographed or abstract pictures to your videos. You can choose one type of picture for your channel uploads, to make it more aesthetic (like a simple background with your logo in the middle).

, Make good quality, HD videos, so you'll attract more people. Don't abandon your channel! Even if it seems like you can't get more than 5 subscribers at the moment, later the future of your channel will be brighter, so don't give up! Make music videos weekly, or even daily. You can write an opinion/description in the description, like 'This song is from a young dutch talent, from his 'The Future' EP. I love it! Will be available to buy on Beatport on 01/08/2014. Enjoy!' or anything like this.

, This is a hard step. However, having a logo as your profile picture and a motto in your channel description can make your account look more professional, and this way you gain more subscribers. The logo should be related to your name, or it can be your name in fancy letters, you decide. A motto is something that describes your channel, like 'The freshest music, every day!'

, How are they doing it? What are they using? What style does their channel have? You can always look for ideas.

, Never forget to give credit in the description to the artists, both who made the song and the picture!

, Made a new video? Great! Share it on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Reddit...

, Your subscribers would be more than happy to like your Facebook page!

, It takes a lot of time and effort for someone to become popular as a music promoter. You can see that even the most popular people had to work years on their channel. Good luck!

, Chances are, your family will have the most intimate knowledge of your life and can help describe who you are. Your parents, in particular, will remember what you were like as an infant and a young child much better than you can. Take a good amount of time to informally interview them about who you are and were.


They will also remind you of embarrassing events that you have tried to forget but are still important in shaping your identity.
They will also be able to remind you of happy moments which you may have completely forgotten about.
Try to interview each member of your family separately so they can feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences relating to your life.

, Send a message to friends you haven't seen in a while and ask if they would like to talk for a bit. Explain that you are doing a sort of autobiography and would like their help. Interview each one of them informally just like you did with your family.


This can also serve as a great way to reconnect with friends you haven't seen in a while. Try to keep up contact with them even after the project is over!

, These will be moments that have clearly shaped who you are today. Examples include:



Jobs. Jobs expose us to many different experiences and the hard work shapes our identity.

Relationships. These can include anything from romantic relationships to friendships. Relationships teach us about ourselves and help us learn how to relate to others. These are important things to include in the video.

Any moves to a new place. Moving to a new place is scary for anyone. It requires us to make new connections and sometimes give up the old. They help forge our identities.

, It is easier to visualise if all of your information is in a single area rather than spread out.


Writing everything down will also help solidify what has been truly important in your life.
At this stage, do not try to eliminate anything from the list. Just get everything down and then figure out what you want to include later in the process.

, It is up to you to decide what you do not want your audience to know. Draw My Life videos tend to get pretty intimate, but it is entirely your decision.


Be aware that your audience probably expects some fairly personal details in the video, though.
Try focusing on 8-10 events or periods in your life which truly shaped who you are today. The video may get too lengthy if you include all the memorable parts of your life.

, While ""Draw My Life"" videos are slightly less formal and more intimate than other videos, they should still have a strong structure. These type of videos are presented in ""slides."" The video maker will draw an event from their life and then voice over the slide, explaining why the event was important. Plan out a general idea of what you want to talk about in each slide. Some things to talk about include:



Why you decided to include the event. Why is this event important? What change did it make in your personality or your identity?

How you perceive the event now. Reflect on how the event makes you feel presently. You likely have a different perspective now than you did when the event initially happened.
Draw My Life videos usually start from birth and lead up to the present, so you should try to follow this structure.

, For example, do not name anybody who bullied you by name since this could ruin their life depending on your audience.


Unless you have consent from people you will talk about in the video, use fake names to preserve their anonymity.

, How emotional do you want to get in the video? Do you want to fully express how you feel to an anonymous audience? If you have a dedicated following, they will likely appreciate the honesty. Be aware, though, not everyone online is nice. They could attack your vulnerability.


For example, if you were bullied growing up, figure out how honest you want to be in terms of your emotional response. People attacking your vulnerability could trigger painful memories.
Do you want to focus on the bad or the good? Figure out what would be the most honest representation of your feelings.

, Many people set up a camera above a whiteboard, with only the whiteboard in frame. You can also use a drawing software, such as Paint or Photoshop if you would prefer.


If you do use a drawing software, you will also need software to record your screen. A popular screen capture software is Fraps.

, Try to only capture the whiteboard, since a border around it could be distracting.


A good way to do this is to extend your tri-pod above the board and then angle the camera downwards.
If you do not have a camera or tripod but do have a phone capable of recording video, you can still make a ""Draw My Life"" video. Just set your phone on a table with the camera sticking off the edge. Set up your whiteboard beneath the table, within the frame of the camera.

,, Figure out what you will be drawing first based on your storyboard. You will likely be starting with your birth or where you were born.


Draw based on your skill. Stick drawings are perfectly acceptable. Your audience is more interested in hearing about your life story, they will excuse bad drawings if your commentary is good.

, Each scene should represent a certain event or memorable period of your life. Try to fully draw each one before moving on to the next.


Use the rule of thirds to capture the scene in a focused way. The rule of thirds helps to draw your viewer's attention to certain parts of the scene.

, Since the entire video is a single shot of a whiteboard, you will have to make your drawings fun and interesting in order to keep the viewer from becoming bored.


Use different colors to help add some flavor to the video.

, If you are happy with the way your drawings turned out, the only major edit you will need to make will be to speed the video up. ""Draw My Life"" videos generally are sped up so the video doesn't drag during the drawings. Use editing software like iMovie or others to speed the video up.


You may also wish to cut scenes that you don't think fit within the video. If you don't feel comfortable with a scene, cut it out. If you think a scene is unnecessary, cut it out. Use your editing skills from previous videos you have made.

, Make sure you're in a place where no one will disturb you. It is much easier to talk over the video rather than trying to talk while drawing. Use the loose script you made earlier and try to edit the audio so that it is succinct and describes the events you are drawing in a focused manner.


Speak clearly and concisely so your audience will be able to understand you.

, Be sure what you are talking about properly lines up with what you are presenting through your drawings. This will be the step that is most arduous in terms of editing.

, Or you can keep it for yourself and watch it when you grow up.


Take any negative comments in stride and try not to let it affect you.

Make more episodes!",How to Make a Good Mermaid Show on YouTube," You might know it's a show about mermaids, but what is it really about? How many people become mermaids? How do they become mermaids? Where did it happen (in a lake, pool, etc)? What problems do they face? Once you answer these questions, it will be easier to develop the concept and begin writing the script.


Watch mermaid shows on YouTube. See what other people have made for their shows. Think about what they are doing that's good and what is not good. Be inspired to create an original version for YouTube, not a copy.
Try not to copy other shows too much, or people will not like the show. Be original! Think what would happen to mermaids who didn't turn into mermaids, they turned into humans and joined the real world, for example. There are so many mermaid shows on YouTube, try to make show stand out and be different from the others! Don't worry, just think outside of the box!
It would be smart to set up a camera or audio camera while your brainstorming, so that if you forget something you wanted to put in your script, you can just go back and watch what you said.;
, Depending on what type of mermaid show it is or the color of your mermaid tail or where the setting is, etc. Let's say your mermaid show is about you and your best friend turning into mermaids, and your tail is Aqua! You could name your show Aqua Tails! Or let's say you and your two best friends move to California and you turn into mermaids, so your mermaid show name could be Mermaids of California. Make it unique!

, Don't freak out and run away just yet, writing the script is really simple. First you'll want to have a brainstorm session with yourself about how you want the video to go. Find somewhere quiet. Now all you have to do is imagine how the episode will go and say it out loud. Then you can write the script once you have the idea in your mind. Break it up into scenes and go easy on yourself. Don't stress about writing the script.


For the first episode, reveal each character's personality. Show how they became mermaids in this episode.
For the second episode, show how they adjust.
For episodes 3 onward, just show the mermaid adventures that they have and maybe introduce more characters.

, Be creative and make sure it goes smoothly and make sure it makes sense!

, Your actors might use their real names, like let's say you hire Chloe to be your actor. Well, if she's a mermaid, she might use her real name of Chloe. If you don't want actors to use their real names, tell them what their name will be. Or you can let them decide so that they feel more connected with the character.


Maybe Aqua or River, or maybe even Misty! You could use Ocean or Oceana, or maybe Celeste or Ria. Choose mermaid names or people names.
Don't use your full name online. Just stay safe.

, Will you record in your house, your neighborhood, your pool, the beach, maybe your friends house, where? List it down on paper to make sure you get all your scenes.


When filming your video, be sure not to get things like a street sign or your address in the shot. You don't want random people knowing where you live.

, Pick your actors wisely. Don't just choose your best friend because she's your friend. She might not know how to remember the script or she might say the lines awkwardly, like a robot. You want it to be like a real TV show, don't you? Choose people who won't make fun of you for making a show about mermaids. Choose people who can say their lines without looking fake, or else you will get bad comments on each episode! Pick people you think would be able to play each part well.


If your best friend hates water, you shouldn't pick her to become a mermaid because it involves a lot of swimming.

, You can't be a mermaid without a tail, right? You can make one (a How-To on Mermaid Tails is in the video) or you can buy one online. Making one is cheaper but will be more work, but if you're willing to do anything for your show you should make one.

, Practice swimming, practice acting, practice the script. Get ready for filming.

, HD is the best choice. Make sure you know how to work the camera. Decide if you will get an underwater camera. Maybe you will only record from above the water. Choose.


Get an underwater or at least a waterproof camera.

, Make sure that if you have someone hold the camera that they aren't shaking it too much, or else it will be hard for the viewers of your show to understand what's going on. Stand it somewhere where you can see yourself and your actors.


If there is an accident like a person walking in and talking to you while your recording, delete the video and start all over! It sucks, I know, but it's the only way to make the video perfect!

, Write the title of the show, the number of the episode, and the name of the episode when your make your title for the video. For example: Mermaids Of California~Episode 1~The Full Moon


Be sure to use the tags! If you tag it as #mermaids, whenever someone does a YouTube search for mermaids, it will show up!

, Don't go all the way up to Episode 69! Make different seasons. After you're done with ten episodes, make episode eleven like this: Mermaids Of California~Season 2~Episode 1~Lovely Waters


When making a new season, it's a good idea to do a season finale for the one your finishing. A season finale is a really special episode at the end of the season. It's usually really dramatic and awesome.

Note that older comments can be pushed to the top of the list by new replies posted beneath the comments., YouTube’s community guidelines prohibit nudity/sexual content, violent/graphic content, hateful content, spam, harmful/dangerous content, threats, and content that doesn’t respect copyright.For comments, the particularly relevant prohibitions are hateful comments, threatening comments, and spam.


Spam: do not use YouTube comments as a platform to advertise your own website or products.

To access this feature, click on the “More” button beneath the video player, then in the drop-down menu that appears, click the “Report” button., What is your purpose for commenting on the video? Did it inspire you? Did it make you laugh? Do you think the person who made the video missed something and could improve it? Are you hoping to start a discussion thread?


As an example, let’s say you’ve watched a dance tutorial video on YouTube. You’re a beginner, and even though the tutorial was aimed at beginners, you felt that it was still too difficult. You want to communicate to the teacher in the video that you found the dance routine difficult to learn.

, Before commenting on a video, skim through as many comments as you can to ensure that you’re not just repeating what someone else has already said.


If you do find a comment that says what you want to say, consider liking (clicking on the “thumbs up” icon below the comment) and/or replying to it (clicking on the word, “Reply,” below their comment), rather than posting a new comment all together.

, If you’re replying to someone else’s comment you might consider tagging the person to whom you are replying and/or tagging the channel name as well. You can do this by typing +or @.A list of names should come up as you type, but if for some reason this doesn’t work, you might have better luck typing in their email addresses.

, If you don’t like a video, it’s okay to say so — just be respectful. If your first thought after watching a video is, “Well, that was terrible. What a waste of time!” why waste more of your time in commenting on it? If you simply must comment, figure out why you hated the video, and offer some advice on how it might be made stronger.


Don’t: “Teaching style sucks! What a waste of time — learn how to teach!!!!”
Do: “Thank you for making this tutorial! I’m a beginner, and even though the tutorial is made for beginners, I really struggled with it. For me, I think it would have really helped to have the dance broken down into more sections, with a couple of run-throughs after each section. At the end, instead of jumping straight to the full routine with music, it would have helped me to go through it twice more slowly and without music.”

, Ideally, social media is about sharing ideas and building connections. If the only comment you have after watching a video is “that was dumb,” you’re not really helping anyone out or adding anything to the conversation. Maybe the video really is dumb; if that's the case and you feel like you simply must comment on it, try being informative, supportive, or at the very least, witty.


In the dance tutorial comment example, the user has made their comment informative by offering advice on how the creator of the video could improve it. Ideally, the creator will take this advice into account for their future tutorials. For added helpfulness, the commenter could even share a link to another video of the routine that they find more helpful (if one exists).

, Don’t be a spammy commenter. If you’re trying to promote your blog or some other product, don’t use other people’s platforms to do it. That said, if you know of another video, website etc. that is more informative than or expands upon the one you’ve just watched, it might make sense to add a link to that video/site/etc. in your comment.


Example: “Thank you for making this tutorial! I’m a beginner, and even though the tutorial is made for beginners, I really struggled with it. For me, I think it would have really helped to have the dance broken down into more sections, with a couple of run-throughs after each section. At the end, instead of jumping straight to the full routine with music, it would have helped me to go through it twice more slowly and without music. For others who want to learn this routine, I found a great tutorial here: website name dot com.

, YouTube comments have an unlimited character count, but this doesn't mean you need to write an essay. The longer your comment, the less likely it is that someone will actually read it. Try to keep it as short as possible, while still being respectful and informative.

, Typing in all capital letters is the written equivalent of shouting online. When your entire comment is in capital letters, people are less likely to take you seriously; they might even make fun of you for your lack of eloquence.An example of how shouting would look in a YouTube comment: “TEACHING STYLE SUCKS! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME — LEARN HOW TO TEACH!!!!”
Compare the all-caps version to the original: “Teaching style sucks! What a waste of time — learn how to teach!!!!” Somehow, the excessive capitalization makes the comment seem even ruder and less intelligent than when it was written in regular case.

, You can use bold, italics, and strikethrough to make parts of your comments pop.Consider italicizing words to help express your tone; bolding words to highlight key ideas; and adding strikethrough to lend humor. If you choose to use these text styles, use them sparingly.


Example: “Thank you for making this tutorial! I’m a (strikethrough)hopelessly terrible dancer(strikethrough) beginner, and even though the tutorial is made for beginners, I really struggled with it. For me, I think it would have really helped to have the dance broken down into more sections, with a couple of run-throughs after each section. At the end, instead of jumping straight to the full routine with music, it would have helped me to go through it twice more slowly and without music.”

, If you are viewing YouTube through a browser (i.e. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Explorer etc.), your options are to close and reopen the browser, or simply hit the refresh button (a curved/circular arrow) that sits next to your browser’s address bar (at the top of the browser window).


If you are logged into the YouTube app on a mobile device such as a smart phone or tablet, close and reopen the app.

, If you are viewing YouTube in a web browser, you should see your Google+ icon (user pic) at the top right of the window. If you are using an app, your Google+ icon will be in the top left corner of the app window.

, If it has comments disabled, you’ll see the words, “Comments are disabled for this video” beneath the video; this means you will not be able to comment.

, If your browser blocks third party cookies, it may be preventing you from commenting on YouTube videos. To remedy this, go to your browser settings/preferences and check your privacy settings to ensure that third party cookies and site data are not blocked.If you want to continue blocking cookies from most third party sites, your browser should give you the option to only allow cookies from YouTube and Google., If all else fails, see if you have the same problem in other web browsers.

Advertise your channel.",How to Get Tons of Subscribers on YouTube," One of the most important steps in getting more subscribers is to provide as much content as you can. The more videos you have, the more popular your channel will become as posting lots of videos makes people want to come back.


More videos means more search result, which will lead to more subscribers.
Do keep in mind though that posting too many videos every week will clog up your channel and make it hard for viewers to find what they are looking for. Group videos into playlists so that people can find the type of videos they are more interested in.;
, Try to upload your videos at regular times throughout the week. Let your subscribers know when your next video will be available, and they will be more likely to return to your channel when the video is released.


People are more likely to subscribe to someone who is regularly producing content as opposed to someone who uploads every once in a while.
Consider live streaming your videos to be able to interact with your audience while they watch you. Live streaming videos are often placed higher in YouTube search results, especially while they are being streamed.

, Make sure that all of your tags match the content of your videos. If someone searches for something and your video pops up because it is improperly tagged, they will leave after a few seconds and most likely never return.


Good tags will make sure that your videos are showing up in relevant searches.
Use multi-word tags as well as single words. People often search for phrases.
Limit yourself to a maximum of 15 hashtags per video. If you use more than that YouTube will ignore all of your hashtags and may not show your video in search results.
Use relevant hashtags that people are searching for. Apps and sites like hashtags4follows.com can help you find these hashtags.

, A well-titled video will stand out much more in a search result list than a poorly-titled one. For example, say you are making a video about baking cookies. A poorly-titled video might say “Bake good cookies”. A better title would be “Bake delicious, chewy cookies in less than 15 minutes”.


The second title is more descriptive, and contains more keywords for search engines to catch.
Popular YouTube accounts often use what is called ""Clickbait"". It is essentially a video title that will make the viewer want to know more. For example, ""what happens next will shock you"" or, ""you won't believe what this person can do"". This is a good trick to get more subscribers but may make many people angry if the video does not live up to the hype.

, Only the first few lines of your description will be visible when the video comes up in a search, so make sure that the beginning of the description does a good job of explaining the video and what the viewer is about to see.


Make sure to include a good number of keywords in your description, but don’t overload it and make it difficult to read.
Ask people to subscribe to you within the description and offer a link to your channel.

, While it is very possible to make successful videos off-the-cuff, creating a script will help you deliver consistent programming. The script will keep you from veering off the theme of your video, as well as help focus your content for your audience.


In the situation of a vlog, you might want to make an outline of what you want to say and go ahead and ramble. Some of the best vloggers do this and then cut out the footage where they say ""um.""

, The most successful videos are ones where the creator is doing what he or she likes. Don’t try to follow the crowd and produce videos mimicking popular trends. You will be far more successful if you make what you want to make, and focus on polishing and building that.

, The introduction is one of the most important parts of a video. It should grab the audience’s attention, lay out the themes and direction of the video, and keep the viewer wanting more. You can do this with personal introductions, graphics, clips of what’s to come, and more.


Keep your introduction powerful but short. Viewers are not likely to sit through more than 10-15 seconds of introduction. This includes titles, graphics, and lead-ins. Hook them quick and then dive in to the main content of your video.

, It is essential that your video’s pacing keeps the viewer from becoming bored. Don’t linger on uninteresting subjects, and keep the action moving forward.


Don’t try to cram too much information into one segment. If you are producing informative videos, consider breaking up the content into multiple parts. This will keep the audience from becoming overloaded with information.
On the flip-side, make sure that you have enough content to justify the length of the video. If the viewer becomes disinterested, even for a second, they will most likely leave to find another video.
For longer videos, add small section breaks where the pace slows down a little. This will give the audience a moment to reflect on what they’ve seen so far before you move on with your content.

, At the end of your video, don’t just say goodbye and turn the camera off. Ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel, link your videos in Facebook, or ask them to leave comments below the video. All of these will lead to more subscriptions, and more interaction with your subscribers.


Use Annotations to add a subscription button inside your video. Make sure that it doesn’t block any of the action, and save it for the ending segment., Even basic editing can help separate your video from the thousands of similar videos on YouTube. Edit out any lulls, mistakes, or bad content.


Take some time to learn how to use a video editing program. There are several free open source video editing programs available, and many digital camcorders come packaged with video editing software.

, If you are making a series of videos based on the same general concept (how-tos, reviews, etc.), come up with common transitions and effects that you can apply to all of your videos. This will give your content a unified feel, making it appear much more professional to the viewer.


Transitions have a large impact on your video branding. Your brand is a very important aspect of YouTube channel success, so be sure to cultivate it as much as possible.

, Experiment with different kinds of shots. Get to know your camera inside and out. Smooth camera work will do wonders for your subscriber retention.


Avoid moving the camera around a lot, unless that is the specific feel you are going for. For example, if you are talking into the camera, and then want to zoom in on an example on the table, don’t film the camera moving. Instead cut from one shot to the other so that the audience doesn’t experience any jarring camera movements.
Get a friend or family member to help. Having a dedicated camera operator can free you up to be more personable in front of the camera. Having a “crew” also adds an air of professionalism to your production, as opposed to just using your webcam to make a movie.
Use a tripod or stand where ever possible to ensure a steady shot. If you must be moving around then use a jib or a camera with optical stabilization.

, Make sure that the content you upload to your channel remains consistent with the theme of your channel. For example, if you start by releasing several movie reviews, don’t move on to uploading recipe videos later. You will lose subscribers if they find that your content doesn’t match their expectations.


Create multiple channels for different subjects and themes. This will allow you to link between your channels but keep your different content separate so as not to confuse viewers.

, Replying to good comments and giving shout-outs to subscribers in your clips will really help strengthen the community of your channel.


Make sure to moderate your channel as well, removing any nasty messages that may upset other subscribers. This will keep your channel friendly and popular.

, Find channels that share your interests, and subscribe to them. Leave thoughtful and well-written comments, and you will soon find subscribers from that channel coming to your channel as well. YouTube is a community, and interacting with it will help you grow much more than simply uploading your videos.


Upload video responses to other videos when they fit, but avoid spamming other channels with your videos. You are likely to be ignored and blocked, which will hurt your chances of gaining subscribers. Treat other channels with respect, and you will start to see yours grow. Make sure you use the name of the channel or person you are responding to in the video title so it can easily be found.
Leave positive comments on other people's videos. Just make sure they are relevant and not spammy.

, Use other social networking outlets such as Facebook and Twitter to advertise your channel. Let your friends and followers know when you’ve uploaded a new video. Include a quick blurb about it when you post.

If you have a blog, include a direct link to your YouTube channel so that your readers can easily find your video content. Simply use the following code to create a YouTube subscription widget:<script src=""https:</script>
<div class=""g-ytsubscribe"" data-channel=""Your Channel Name Here"">
</div>

Upload several high-quality videos each week.,
Have a theme for your channel.,
Be enthusiastic on camera.,
Be unique.,
Record a channel intro video.",How to Get Subscribers on YouTube1," No one will subscribe to a channel without any content on it. If you want to get people to subscribe to your channel, it's important to start regularly posting videos. Create a schedule and stick to it.


Have set times for uploading, and let people know when you release new videos. Work video-making into your schedule regularly. If you've got every Thursday afternoon free to make videos, then release a video every Friday.
Be consistent. Try to stick to your schedule as much as possible. People will unsubscribe sometimes, if your channel sits dormant for too long.;
, Most people subscribe to channels that feature specific and unique content that they enjoy. If you want subscribers, it's important to make your channel as specific as possible. Do you make cooking videos? Reviews? Vlogs? ASMR videos? Pick a theme and stick to it.


Most people don't subscribe to channels with totally random home videos thrown up. Even if you want your channel to feature different kinds of videos, it's still good to have some sort of basic theme. Maybe it's humor videos, or just content for kids. Whatever the case, it's good to have a topic in mind.
If you want to make, say, both gaming videos and cooking videos, consider starting two different channels to feature those videos. It's likely you'll end up with more subscribers for each separately, than both together.

, The most successful YouTube users are usually pretty high-energy. People like to be entertained, so it's a good idea to put on your best and most energetic face when you make videos. You need to look like you care about the topic you're discussing.


Take some time to make sure you look good on camera. You don't have to have movie-star looks to be successful on YouTube, but it helps to clean up a little before you record videos.
Not all videos need to be super-enthusiastic. If you're recording affirmation videos, or vlogs of political commentary, it might be better to be kind of quiet. Match your energy level to the video you're making.

, People subscribe to channels that provide content they can't find elsewhere. If you want to get more subscribers, your channel needs to include videos that can't be found on other better channels. Even if you're a big fan of the NeedleDrop's music reviews, or Jenna Marbles humorous vlogs, it's important to find some way to specialize, or improve upon the content you like.


Maybe you like music and want to review new records. Cool. Pick a specific genre to get even more specific and appeal to a particular audience. NeedleDrop's got the full-indie spectrum covered, but maybe you just review K-Pop, or death metal.

, Let people know what your channel is all about by recording a channel intro video that will play when someone clicks on your channel. These videos are usually short, provide a brief introduction to who you are and what you do, and invite people to subscribe for more.

Learn more about your viewers.,
Use better sound and video equipment.,
Edit your content well.,
Keep your videos uncluttered and neat.,
Make lots of different kinds of videos.,
Match the length of the video to your topic.",How to Get Subscribers on YouTube2," Google provides free analytics services to YouTube content creators, so they can track and analyze the kinds of people attracted to their videos. When you know a little more about them, you can make content that will appeal to that audience more directly. Google's analytics services provide information including:


approximate age
gender
geographical location

, Most people won't subscribe to channels with fuzzy audio and phone-quality video. If you're serious about having a successful channel, it's a good idea to invest in an HD video camera with a good microphone for recording audio. Read this article to learn more about good cameras for making videos.If you can't spend money on new camera and recording equipment, it's still important to make sure your videos are clear, steady, well-lit, and synched properly.

, One thing you'll notice about a lot of successful YouTube content creators is that their videos are heavily edited. Most popular videos are not just long, single-takes. Lots of the jokes and style of the YouTube video come from quick jump-cuts and humorous little moments.


Often, YouTubers will record a long video, but then cut it up to include only the funniest parts in the best order. Play around with your videos in a basic editing software like iMovie. Only keep the best bits.
Don't record your videos straight to YouTube. Take some time to edit them before making them live on your channel.

, Popular YouTube videos are short, clean, and neat. No long intros or credits at the end, no loud soundtrack in the background, no fancy fades or camera tricks. It should just feature the content that you want to highlight.


If you want to share links, put the links in the description box below the video. Link boxes in the video are annoying for lots of users who just want to watch. This might get your other videos more accidental views, when people click on them while trying to delete the boxes, but it won't get you more subscribers.

, It's good to have a theme for your channel, but people don't want to watch the exact same video over and over and over. Try to mix it up. Come up with a few different types of features, or a short week-long theme for your channel, to give people a reason to keep watching.


If you do cooking videos, mix up the type of recipes you feature. Aim for a dessert item one week, then an entrée the next. Do a month of only your best Italian dishes. Do a month where you try out recipes you've never tried before. Do a month of dishes your grandmother showed you.

, Some popular channels feature videos that are quite long, 15-20 minutes, while other popular channels feature videos that never go past the four minute mark. The video should be long enough to do what you want it to do, and no longer.


If your channel appeals to younger kids, keep the videos short. Humor videos and blogs should be no longer than 3-4 minutes.
If your channel appeals to an older, specialized audience, like for beer or cigar reviews, your videos should be more in-depth and longer.

Advertise your channel on social media.,
Follow similar channels.,
Comment regularly on videos you like.,
Keep up with the comment stream on your own videos.,
Interact with your viewers.,
Celebrate subscriber milestones in video.",How to Get Subscribers on YouTube3," When you make videos, you an share them on your personal Facebook, Twitter, and other social media accounts, but your friends might get annoyed pretty quickly every time you put up a video. Consider making a social media account for the channel itself, and asking your friends to subscribe to those specifically.Friend other popular YouTube channels on social media, and try to get the word out as much as possible.
Online forums for the topics you're interested in are also good places to promote your channel. If you do music reviews, post your videos on a music discussion board.

, If you want follows, it's important for you to follow and subscribe to lots of channels as well. You need to be a video-watcher as well as a video-maker. Often, if people recognize that you're making similar videos, they'll just automatically follow you back.

, One good way to attract attention to your channel is to comment positively and participate in the YouTube community. When you watch a video that you like, encourage the person who made it. Respond to a question asked in the video, or post a response video if you have something to say.


Be positive. Negative trolling comments won't get you any subscribers.
Don't advertise your channel on popular videos. Writing, ""Hey check out my channel"" on the newest Justin Bieber video just looks tacky, and won't yield you many subscribers.

, When people take the time to comment on your videos, try your best to find the time to respond to them. Even if the comment is on a video that's three months old, it's good to Try to keep up as much as possible and at least say something to your commenters.


If your videos start getting a lot of subscribers, this will get impossible pretty quickly. Still, it's important to interact with at least a few of the commenters on your newest videos. Try to keep up as much as possible.
Sometimes, the YouTube comment stream can be an ugly place. Don't argue with commenters. If someone's trolling your videos with crude stuff or dumb comments, just ignore them., Popular channels are often the ones that feature the most interaction with the fans and subscribers. Try to find ways to respond directly to your growing numbers of fans.


Pick good questions from the comments stream and answer those questions on camera.
Tell your subscribers that you're looking for ideas for new videos, and try out some of their ideas if they're good.
Invite your subscribers to post response videos to your videos. Invite your subscribers to comment with specific questions or comments.

, One technique that popular YouTube channels often employ is doing a special video of some kind for a subscription milestone. As soon as you get 100 subscribers, do a special video to commemorate. Bake a cake on your cooking video, or do a ""Top 100 Songs of All Time"" review on your music review channel.

The audience may be people who enjoy sketch comedy, people looking for product reviews, people interested in video games, people looking for fashion advice, or any other audience you can imagine. Good channels focus on one thing that they do best, and then excel at that.;
, Besides choosing a niche, you'll also need to develop a personality. PewDiePie didn't get 40 million subscribers because he plays video games, he got them because he plays video games with a unique personality and approach. You'll want to cultivate an identity that sets you apart from the other content being produced in your niche.

, Before you launch your first video, you should have the basic building blocks of your channel established. This includes having a good profile image, unique banner art, and a basic description. All of this put together is the starting point for your personal brand, which is how viewers will relate to and remember you.


Look at all of your favorite channels and see how they brand themselves. You'll find that virtually every popular channel has a custom look that helps identify themselves.

, Your profile image will appear next to the name of your channel in searches and comments on YouTube. It will be the first thing viewers see when your content appears in their search results, so make sure that it is representative of you and your brand.


Your profile image can be a picture of you if you are the focus, or your logo if you are not the focus.

, This is the image that appears at the top of your Channel, and acts as the title. Channel Art is what makes viewers feel like they're on your ""personal"" YouTube, and helps cement your name in their mind.


If you are creating your own art, YouTube recommends that the image be 2560 X 1440 px. This is the size of the image that will appear on the TV. All text and logos should appear in the center of the image in a 1546 X 43 px rectangle.Channel art can be commissioned from a variety of sources including oDesk and Elance. If you can, create a basic banner to get by for a while, and then use your first ad earnings to invest in commissioned art.

, Use this space to give a brief overview of your channel and to link viewers to your other webpages and social networking sites. The description of your channel appears in searches, but doesn't have to be incredibly in-depth.


Make sure to link to your company website, blog, Facebook page, Twitter account, and any other place on the web you have a presence.

, The difference between a built-in webcam and a high-quality camera is night-and-day. Even if it's just you talking into a camera, the audio and visual quality you get from a high-end camera will make your videos stand out.


The equipment isn't necessarily expensive. A stand-alone webcam will work better than virtually any built-in webcam, and will only set you back a few meals out.
If you're filming actors or anything other than yourself, you'll want a decent camcorder. Taking videos with your phone is convenient, but if you want to keep an audience you'll need better production values than that.
If you're going to be recording your screen, find a good screen recording program such as Camtasia or the free OpenBroadcastingSoftware(which can also do live streams). Filming your computer screen with a camera while you use it will make it nearly impossible to see what's going on.

, Unless you're doing improv or filming something you don't have control over, you should prepare a script and rehearse it. This will lead to less awkward pauses and will improve the flow of your videos.


Youtube doesn't allow videos longer than 15 minutes unless you meet specific guidelines. Keep this in mind when writing your script, and break up long videos into a series.
See this guide for detailed instructions on writing your first script.

, Do a dry run of your script a few times before you turn on the camera. This will help you iron out any kinks and solidify your talking points before you begin filming. You don't want to be reading directly from your script while filming, so practice is important.

, Before you start filming, gather everything you're going to need for the video. For example, if you're recording a tutorial on your computer, make sure all of the windows you need are open and your important files are easy to access. If you're filming a scene, make sure that all of your props are in order.


While preparing to shoot, make sure that the lighting is good enough so that everything can be seen. Do a test shoot with the camera to check the lighting.

, Once you've got everything ready, it's time to start rolling! Shoot your video, and don't be afraid to do multiple takes. You can splice and edit in your different takes during the editing process.


Remember, don't read off your script! You want your talking to feel natural, and people will be able to tell when you're reading off a page.
If you're directing other actors, check out this guide on good movie directing techniques.

, Before you start editing, take a few minutes to watch everything you recorded. If you aren't happy with any part of it, reshoot that part now while everything is still set up. This will save you a lot of time in the editing process.

, Use your favorite editing program to build your video using all of your footage. You can cut and paste clips so that takes you shot later on can be placed anywhere in the video. There's a lot to keep in mind when editing, but you want to focus mainly on making sure the video flows smoothly from topic to topic, and that there aren't any errors.


Use transitions to hide cuts between takes and to take the viewer from one scene to the next.
Continuously review your video as you are editing it. Make adjustments to the timing of scenes so that you don't linger too long on one or leave another too soon.
There are a variety of guides on wikiHow for using different video editing programs, including Windows Movie Maker, Avidemux, Adobe Premiere, and more.
There are also guides on general editing practices that can help you with the basics of editing.

, The introduction is an important but brief part of your video. Most introductions should be no longer than 5-10 seconds, and should quickly inform the viewer what channel they are watching and what the content of the video will be. Your introduction will help viewers identify you video when they see it elsewhere on the web, and will help keep them watching your video for the content.


If your intro is too long, it will drive away a large portion of your potential viewers.
If you have a log or other Channel art, make sure to include it in the introduction.
You can use Adobe Premiere or Sony Vegas to add professional effects and transitions to your videos.

, When you upload your video, you can set the thumbnail. This is the image that appears for the video when it turns up in search results or is listed in your Channel.


If your account is not verified, you will only be able to choose from a few preset thumbnail options. Make sure you verify your account by submitting your phone number.
Custom thumbnails allow you to create a ""Title Screen"". This can have text on it, your logo, a screenshot from the video, or anything else to help draw the viewer in. A popular strategy is to include the title of the video as well as some custom graphics.
See this guide for details on adding thumbnails to uploaded videos or videos you've added in the past.

, Good tagging will help ensure that your video appears in viewers' searches. Tags can be single words or small phrases. For example, if you are making a video about your cat, your tags could include ""cat"", ""funny"", ""funny animals"", ""cute cats"", kitten, etc.


Make sure that your tags are accurate, or you will draw in viewers that don't want to see your content. This will end up driving more people away.

, You should aim to be uploading new content on at least a weekly basis. While you don't want to drown your viewers in videos, a steady flow of releases will keep them glued to your Channel. If you can't produce major releases that often, fill in the gaps with smaller videos to keep your viewers content until the next big video drops.


Try to release videos during prime time for your main audience. This is usually around lunchtime or after dinner for whatever timezone you are most popular in. Releasing at a good time of the day will help ensure that the most people see it.

, The best way to get people to subscribe to your channel is to simply ask them to. End each of your videos with an annotation that will allow them to subscribe to your channel with one click. If the viewer liked your video, there is a very good chance that they will click the link to receive updates when your new videos get uploaded.


You can use annotations to link to other videos on your channel as well. This can be useful for people that arrive at your video without visiting your channel, or to draw attention to an old video that is still relevant. Just make sure that your video isn't constantly obscured by annotations.

, Playlists are collections of videos that the playlist creator feels are related. If you have a lot of related videos on your channel, or you are creating a series, a playlist is a great way to get more views for all of the videos included. Playlists also show up separately on searches, giving you double exposure for your videos.

, YouTube is a community of creators, and you need to take advantage of that. reach out to other content creators in your niche and work out some cross-promotional material. Guest appearances are very popular, and can help you catch the attention of the other user's viewers.


When making a video with a guest appearance, it will help if you can be in the same room as the other person, but you can record clips remotely and splice them together to great effect.
Reach out to as many people in your niche as possible, but don't neglect creating your own content. You aren't likely to get positive responses from other creators until you have a decent amount of your own content.

, It's not enough to just have a YouTube Channel. If you want to bring in new viewers, you'll need to be pushing updates through other forms of social media. You automatically get a Google+ page when you create a channel, but you'll also want a Facebook page, a Twitter account, a blog, and even an online store.

, Every time you release something on your Channel, you should link to it in a tweet. Many people rely on Twitter to stay connected to their favorite content, and timely tweets will keep them informed.

, Your Comments section is a great way to stay in contact with your loyal viewers, but can also be a cesspit of trolling. Do what you can to respond to genuine viewers and moderate the Comments section to the best of your abilities to keep the community friendly.


Twitter is another way to stay connected with your audience. Beyond tweeting new releases, you should be interacting with your more loyal viewers and other content creators. Retweet good videos that you find, and respond to inquiries from your fans.
Behind-the-scenes looks at your process are a great way to let viewers feel more involved.

, Every new video you create should be posted on Facebook as soon as it is uploaded. As the video gains Likes on Facebook, it will become more visible, and can draw people to your Channel. Make sure to include a link to your Channel page in the post.

, You can embed your videos in your blog so that your readers who might not visit YouTube can see them. Your blog can act as an inside look into your process, or a way to expand on topics covered in videos. Make sure that your blog is linked in your Channel's About tab.


You can add a YouTube widget to your blog that will allow readers to quickly subscribe to your YouTube channel without having to search for it. The Google Developers site has detailed instructions on embedding the widget on any website.

, If you're having difficulties getting your channel kickstarted, you can try purchasing views. These typically come by the thousands, and there are a variety of services online that offer views for sale.


Many music labels purchase views to ensure that new songs start off with high amounts of views. Videos that have lots of views are more likely to be viewed by real viewers, as the number of views acts as a sort of validation about how good the video is.Make sure that the service you choose offers real views, where each view stays and watches the entire video.
YouTube frowns upon the purchasing of views.

, Looking at what other popular YouTubers are doing is a great way to learn some tactics for increasing your viewership. Look at all of the pieces that make up their YouTube presence: Channel identity, video quality and techniques, social media outreach, and interaction with the community and other content creators. The following steps will give you some starting places for your genre of choice.

, How-To and tutorial videos are a very popular genre on YouTube. These can range from tying a tie to using an image editing program. A good how-to video will clearly lay out the steps and provide good visual examples. Popular How-To channels include:


Howcast
Make Magazine
Houdini
Khan Academy

, Gaming videos have quickly become one of the most popular genres on YouTube, with hundreds of different channels all talking about and showing games. Gaming channels can range from talk shows about the gaming community to in-depth reviews and gameplay videos. Some of the most popular gaming channels include:


PewDiePie
Rooster Teeth
Total Biscuit
CaptainSparklez
Angry Joe

, YouTube is a bustling hub of up-to-the-minute fashion news and trends. Many of the more popular fashion channels are focused more on what the personality is wearing than any specific tips. If you have an eye for fashion, check out some of these popular fashion channels for ideas on making your own:


Weylie
Zoe Sugg
Patricia Bright

, If your goal is to make people laugh, you're in the right place. YouTube is home to countless comedians, and many got their professional start on YouTube. Check out some of the more popular ones to see how they did it:


Jash
Nerdist
JennaMarbles
Just For Laughs Gags

Choose a service according to your budget.",How to Get More Views on Your YouTube Videos," This is a good place to use specific keywords, or terms that people may type into YouTube search. If you want people to find your video under the search term ""funny things to do with your lizard"" then that should be the name of your video. This will also help your video be found under the word ""lizard"" and term ""things to do with your lizard"". Make sure you include all of your keywords in the video file.;
, It should be short, engaging, and to the point. If your video is about your kid spilling macaroni and cheese everywhere, just call it ""Mac and Cheese Disaster."" It should pique your viewers' interests without giving too much away.


A very effective technique to boost views is to write a title that makes people want to click on it, this is called ClickBait. For example ""What this lizard does next will surprise you"" or ""You wont believe the weird thing this lizard can do"".
Consider using your keywords in the videos title. This is one of the main bits of information that YouTube and Google use to decide what your video is about.
If your video is about another YouTuber then use their username in the title, this may help your video show up more in their related videos section.

, Most people ignore this step, but you should take it seriously to increase your views. Describe your video as accurately as possible in the space you are given, taking 2-3 paragraphs to write an interesting and precise description of what people can expect when they see the video. This is another great opportunity  to include your keywords and search terms for a higher chance of your video being found.

, Use all of the keywords from your title and description in the ""tags"" section to get more viewers interested. The more relevant tags you use, the more often your video will pop up when people search it. For example, if you're posting a video of your cute sleepy dog, you could use words like ""Sleepy,"" ""Dog,"" ""Hilarious,"" and ""Cutest."" Make sure you don't include extra tags in the description, as those are not included when people search for them.


You can use tags that describe your video as well as other relevant popular videos to make sure that as many people as possible see your video when they are searching YouTube.

, The earlier you share it, the more likely it will be to be a YouTube sensation. If you wait a week to share it while it barely gets any views, it'll be much more likely to be forgotten by the YouTube community. Remember, timing is everything. Think of when your audience is likely to watch your video and release right before then (evenings and weekends are a good suggestion).

, Create an email list consisting of the people who know you well enough to be actually intrigued by your new YouTube video, and send them the link and encourage them to watch it. You can even add, ""I can't wait to hear what you think!"" to show that you really expect them to watch your video. If you don't care about potentially annoying people, just send it out to as many people as you can.


If you have an intriguing subject and a persuasive email, there's a good chance anyone will look at the video without even knowing you very well.

, Post your video on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google Plus, and any other social networking sites that you've joined. Ask your friends to like, comment on, and share your post. This will help gain some traction on your video post and it may even go viral.


Connect your Google Plus and Twitter accounts to your YouTube. Then YouTube will be able to automatically share each new video you upload. You can also use online automation sites like ifttt.com to post new videos across all your social media accounts automatically.

, If you have a blog or a website, you can use it to market your videos. If you don't have a blog or website of your own but know friends with websites or blogs that are popular, ask your friends if they can help you out by sharing your video with their fans. Embedding your video on websites can help your video rank higher in both YouTube and Google.


If your video is something news-worthy then consider submitting your video to a news website like Mashable, if its accepted and posted on a news site then you will be guaranteed  to have many more views.

, Create your video, then go into an editor and remove the long pauses, and other distractions in the video. If the video paces faster, people will continue to watch.


Try to have the same lighting while recording your video and keep the same distance from the camera to make the video cuts blend together better.

, A good audio track can spruce up the video and disguise any audio problems you may have had. YouTube just released an audio library you can choose from at If you want to monetize your videos then avoid using copyrighted music and stick to public domain music or the YouTube library.

, This includes an email address, website, twitter handle and more. Some people may not be watching this video on YouTube. You want them to know who you are in those cases. Text can also keep or direct attention on-screen. Use it to your advantage.


Including a link to your channel and other videos in the description can help you get more views.
If you want to include links that look a bit too long you can use a link shortener like goo.gl which will make them much easier to read.

, Put something at the end of your videos to point where they can find you. Add some bloopers or extra footage. People love to see the extras at the end and your watch time might increase. Alternatively you could have a second separate video that contains the bloopers. You can mention and link that video at the end, this way if someone watched it then you will have 2 separate video views from the same viewer. People who watch more of your videos are also more likely to subscribe to your channel.

, Annotations are an amazing way to increase your video views. They can link one video to another, or they can link a video to your playlists or channels. An annotation can tell viewers to link to a different similar video if they like the one they're watching, and can keep them viewing all of your different videos for hours.

, Getting subscribers is an excellent way of guaranteeing that more viewers will watch your videos. If someone subscribes to you, then they will see all of your newly-uploaded videos on their homepage, and they can even select to be notified via email whenever you've posted a new video. If you want to get more subscribers, you can ask people to subscribe at the end of a video, include an annotation that encourages people to subscribe to your video, or even ask people to subscribe to you over email. When asking people to subscribe to your video point towards the subscribe button. This will draw focus towards the button and can result in more subscribes.

, At the end or anytime during the video, ask the viewers to like it or share it by mentioning things like 'it would take 0.12 second to hit that like button'. Its because most of the time, even after people like the video, they don't notice it.


Say something in your video that many people have an opinion on and then asking people to click like if they agree or to comment if they disagree. For example at the end of a video about your dog you could say ""I don't think dogs should be on a leash when in public. Hit like if you agree, or tell us what you think in the comments"".
Simply asking a question in your video can also result in an increase in comments.

, Playlists are lists of videos that play one after the other, just like a playlist of music. If you create an entire playlist of videos, then viewers will be more likely to view more of your videos. For example, if you create a playlist of different videos that display different gymnastics skills, your viewers can watch your video about cartwheels and then transition right into your video about handstands., Make sure to be nice. Some people might click on the commenter's channel to check out their videos., Depending on your account and how it is done, this can violate YouTube's Terms of Service and risk the termination of your account.Like any slightly sketchy internet service, it also comes with the risk of being scammed.

, Choose a provider which guarantees your video won't be removed or your account won't be banned. The best services will offer the following characteristics, some will even offer a money back guarantee:


High retention views: this means the users watch the entire video or at least most part of it. If you buy a lot of views that only watch the first 5 seconds of your video then YouTube may consider your video as something that is boring or uninteresting and they will show your video less in the YouTube search results & recommended videos.
Non mobile only views: in the past some users and services have abused of this kind of views causing banned accounts and removed videos.
Drip Feed views: it means the views for the video will increase slowly but steady so it looks natural to YouTube.
Mixing your views with extra likes, comments and subscriptions: this will make the growth in viewership seem more natural.
Getting Views from bots effects your Channel. So it is better to Buy Views from those who provide Real Human Views like , There are a variety of companies that offer this service at different rates. Choose a reliable company and do your research to find out which one fits your budget, and read up on reviews and customer experiences to avoid getting scammed. Look for services that offer world wide views and do not just provide views from third world countries as that may cause suspicion.


When choosing a company make sure they accept a safe form of payment such as PayPal or Bitcoin. Try to avoid entering in your credit card number directly into the website.
Never give the company or website your YouTube password. No company should ever need this to increase your views.

You can include links to your other websites in your channel description as a way to promote yourself online.
Connect your other social profiles to your YouTube account so that people can follow you on other social media. This will help build your own community.

, This part is important. Without the right tags, no one's going to find your videos! When you upload a video to your channel, choose tags that are descriptive and specific. You don't want to use the exact same tags as everyone else, because your video will get buried that way.Choose keywords that apply to your video - don't mislead viewers with a keyword that's not really relevant.
Use both broad and specific tags to get the most views. Tag with the names of people you mention, keywords related to events you talk about, and so on.
Find out the tags that people are searching for and use them. There are many tagsforlikes websites that will help you find these tags.

, If you don't have a relationship with someone, don't ask them to watch or link to your video. This is a faux pas in the world of YouTube. Instead, work the relationships you already have and let the viewership build naturally. It's not going to happen overnight, but with persistence you'll see your views going up.


Share your videos via other social networks like Facebook, Google Plus, and Twitter.
Never spam people you don't know with links to your videos, either on their walls or in their comments.
As a last resort you can artificially boost your view count by buying views on sites that offer that service; however do so only if you have tried everything else first, as these views may not always result in many subscribers.

, To gain popularity, respond to each and every person who leaves you a comment. This is a good way to start building new relationships with your subscribers. If someone leaves you a nice message, respond! If they ask for advice, give it. Be genuine and friendly, and you'll attract more and more people. Here are a few other good ways to interact with your subscribers:


Friend subscribers who friend you. Spread the love to other people!
Get a Twitter account and follow people who have followed your YouTube channel. Interact with them as much as possible.

, YouTube is a community, and if you want to be popular, you need to participate. Interact with other people on their walls, via messages, on Twitter, and in any other way you can. Give genuine positive feedback.


Make sure you actually watch videos before leaving a comment. People will know if you're being fake, especially if you spam them with a link to your channel.
Keep your own viewers in mind when you engage with other channels. Like videos you think your viewers will benefit from. Link to videos that will enhance your channel, too.
Mention the YouTubers that you watch in the videos you make.

, To keep people coming back, you need to update your channel frequently. If possible, do it on a schedule so people will know they can expect to see new content on a certain day. Make videos that are consistently high quality and offer something original every time.


In between new videos, spend time ""liking"" other people's videos and promoting other content so your subscribers will have something to keep them occupied until your next video is ready.
Keep engaged with your subscribers throughout the week, not just on the day you post videos.
If you know you will not be able to post on a certain day or week then make a video in advance and schedule it.
Post as frequently as possible, the top YouTubers will often post videos daily.

, Viewers will be able to tell in less than 10 seconds whether you're being genuine in your videos. Are you funny, intense, or sweet and bubbly? Whatever your unique personality traits might be, show them off in your videos. The same way you'd be yourself with your family and friends, you need to be you in your videos. Otherwise, viewers will look elsewhere for authenticity and entertainment.


You're going to be nervous the first few times you make a video - that's normal. If it helps, think of the camera as your friend, sister or brother. Joke around or get deep the same way you would with someone you trust.
Don't be worried about embarrassing yourself! If you stumble over your words a little or say something that's not very funny, your viewers will relate to you even more because they'll see you as human. People don't go to YouTube to find polished Hollywood-esque stars. Be relatable.
Don't copy other people's styles. Figure out what's original about you and play it up.

, If you look through the most popular YouTube videos, you'll see that each one offers something interesting. Some offer amazing music, others offer thoughtful advice, and still others offer a few minutes of hilarious entertainment. What are you going to offer to people watching your video? Keep this in mind with every video you make.


What's your area of expertise? Your own life is a good place to start. Offer advice based on what you've experienced, like how to become the most popular girl in school, how to kiss, how to play guitar, how to build a robot, or how to straighten curly hair.
Offer opinions. What's your take on world politics, pop culture news, sports, music, etc.?
Offer something that will make people laugh. Tell jokes, show your pet's antics, parody someone else's video, or do impressions of a famous person.
Ask for other peoples opinions at the end of your videos and encourage them to comment. This will help to build your community.

, Just like you would in front of any audience, you need to speak clearly and make eye contact with your YouTube audience. This holds viewers' attention and makes your videos much more interesting to watch. Look directly into the camera and enunciate your words!

, This is YouTube, so no one's expecting your video to be perfect, but if it has terrible lighting and bad sound, people are going to click away. The best way to have good video quality is to use a decent video camera. Some phones come with pretty good video features, so this shouldn't be too hard to do. No matter what kind of video camera you're using, do the following things to improve the video quality:


Turn on lights for indoor videos. This will brighten the picture and make everything look more colorful and interesting. Experiment with turning on lights placed in various parts of the room until you're satisfied with how your videos look. Make sure your face and features are clearly visible, even if the background isn't. The light should be facing whatever it is your recording.
Eliminate background noises. Turn off your air conditioner, get your dog to stop barking, and turn off the TV in the other room. These noises will lower the quality of your video. Try to record your videos in rooms that do not have an echo.

, Use Movie Maker or another type of video editing software to boost the quality of your videos and make them a lot more interesting to watch. Aim to edit them down to about 4-5 minutes — anything longer isn't going to hold people's attention unless it's truly fascinating. Keep these pointers in mind when you're editing:


Use tools to brighten the video. It shouldn't look too dark and dreary.
Edit out the boring parts. Pauses, dull expressions, coughs, sighs, and other boring interludes can be cut to give your video a faster and more interesting pace.
Use text and music to add more personality. This isn't totally necessary, but you can add background music and text to your videos for a little extra oomph. It's a good opportunity to include a message to ""like"" your video, include some funny descriptions of what you're doing in the video, or promote your Twitter or Facebook account.
Your videos aren't complete until you give them awesome titles and descriptions, and make sure the thumbnail is an attention-grabber. Include keywords and search terms within these fields to maximize the chance of your videos being found.

Watch videos at lower quality.",How to Make YouTube Videos Load Faster2," Sometimes all it takes to speed up YouTube videos is a simple browser update. Take steps to update Google Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer and see if that improves things.

, This can greatly affect the quality of videos. You'll need to find the driver on your computer, install any updates you find, and restart your computer.

,


Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera are all modern browsers that work well with YouTube.

, If it's not so important to see the videos clearly, you can try loading them at a lower quality, like 360p instead of 720p. The higher the video quality, the longer it takes to load on many browsers.


You might also try using a smaller image size when you're watching videos. Things might speed up if you don't use fullscreen mode.

, all you need in order to record audio is a microphone. Some microphones can connect to your computer via a USB cable, and others need to be hooked up to an audio interface. Do not forget that most smart phones are also able to record audio, yet the quality is usually lower than using an external microphone. Most digital cameras also have microphones built in, but if you are looking for higher end quality, this is not the best way to go. An external microphone can be added onto your camera for superior quality, or you can record the video and audio separate.

, It is common for many people to record a video in addition to the audio. This can be achieved by using a a high quality digital camera, a computer webcam which is convenient because it connects to your computer, or even your smart phone. Usually, the camera is directed to you and your instrument, but the video can be about anything you desire.

, Have an audio and video program on your computer ready to edit and enhance your video.


In regards to audio, many programs and software are available to use. If you are recording your audio alongside your video with a video camera or smart phone, you can use a video program to process both, but if you are choosing to record your audio separability, you can utilize your computer's ability to process audio and create a home studio. You can use programs such as Garage Band, Pro Tools, and Reason to record your audio, and if you have a midi controller or keyboard, you can add sounds and effects onto your audio such as drums, guitars, organs, strings, or even sound effects. The possibilities are limitless.
For the final video, basic iMovie or Movie Maker will be able to create a clean cut movie. If you are using Linux, or you do not want to use the other programs, free alternatives are available, including Lightworks and Avidemux. Other programs such as Final Cut Pro offer more features and options, but are not absolutely necessary.

, Once you have your song ready and equipment to use, you can now begin to record yourself. Don't worry if you need to multiple takes, you can edit everything out later. Be sure that your camera lens is focused and that you have proper lighting. If you are using an external microphone, make sure your audio program is on and recording.

, Now that you have everything recorded, you need to upload it to your computer. Cameras and phones can usually connect via USB, while webcam footage and audio software can save directly to your computer.

, The difficulty of this step varies depending on the equipment you used. If you used a smart phone or digital camera with a microphone built in, the audio and video will already match up and you can easily edit out unwanted segments. If you used audio separate of your video, you will need to align both together. Various effects can also be added. Once you are done you need to export the video to a location on your computer.

, Now that you have the video, you can go ahead and publish it onto YouTube. If you don't have an account, create one and click the “Upload” button on the upper right hand side. From there you can select your video from your computer to upload. You can then title your video, add tags, and create a description. Larger videos might take longer to process. Once you click “Publish,” your video is then uploaded.

, If desired, don't forget to share the video with friends on social media sites.

Check the boxes signifying that you agree, then sign your name.,
Click submit and wait for a decision.",How to Unblock Copyright Infringement on YouTube," Content ID is a system that identifies potential copyrighted content in videos by scanning uploaded videos for previously-uploaded content. The system will scan for audio, video, and images. If a match occurs, the original owner is notified and a Content ID claim is filed.


The original owner can choose to do nothing, mute their audio in your video, block the video from being viewed, monetize the video, or track the video's viewership.;
, Content ID claims are not necessarily a negative thing for your account. If you're fine with part of the audio being blocked or with ad revenue going to the original owner, you can decide not to do anything.


The only time a Content ID claim can be negative is when the owner blocks your video globally. This can put your account in bad standing.

, If your claim was because of a song used in your video, you can try Youtube's automated removal tools to take the song out without having to re-upload the video:Open the Video Manager page and find the video you want to remove or swap the song from.
Click the ▼ button next to ""Edit"" and select ""Audio.""
Click ""Remove this song"" next to the Content ID'd song you want to remove. This may not be possible on all videos.
Select a replacement track if you'd like from the YouTube Audio Library. Many of these songs are free to use and monetize.

, This is mainly for uploaders that create cover songs, and allows you to share revenue with the original owner:Find the video in your Video Manager. You can see which videos apply for this in the Monetization section of your account.
Click the gray ""$"" button next to the video. This will only appear if the content owner has enabled the revenue sharing feature on their end.
Wait for the request to be reviewed and approved. You will be notified if the owner approves sharing revenue.

, If you believe the Content ID claim is not valid, you can file a dispute. The claimant will have 30 days to respond to a dispute. You should only dispute if you believe your video was misidentified because you own or have rights to all of the content. If you dispute without a valid reason, you can receive a copyright strike.

, You can open it directly at youtube.com/my_videos_copyright.

, This will display what content was flagged by Content ID.

, If you still believe the claim was invalid, proceed.

, You'll only be able to continue if you select the last four options in the list. Only choose a reason that is actually true, or you will receive a copyright strike. These include:


The video is my original content and I own all of the rights to it.
I have a license or written permission from the proper rights holder to use this material.
My use of the content meets the legal requirements for fair use or fair dealing under applicable copyright laws.
The content is in the public domain or is not eligible for copyright protection.

, You'll be asked to review your choice and check a box to confirm that you're sure the claim is false.

, You'll be asked to type out a short summary of why you're filing a dispute. Make sure to clearly explain why you believe your video fits the description you picked above. Keep the message short and to the point.


Don't worry about using legal language here, just write natural sentences explaining why you believe your video should not have a Content ID claim filed against it.

, This will formalize the claim, and it will be sent to YouTube for review. Filing fraudulent disputes can lead to your account being disabled.

, If you've received a copyright strike on your video, it's because the original creator or owner has decided that your video does not fall under ""fair use."" Fair use allows you to use content that others have created, but only in specific circumstances that are decided on a case-by-case basis. Fair use is a fairly complicated topic, but generally your video will be measured against the following four factors (in the US):The purpose of using the copyrighted content. The video needs to add new expression or meaning to the original copyrighted content. Non-profit and educational uses are given more leeway, but are not exempt. If your video is monetized, your chances of claiming fair use diminish.
The nature of the copyrighted content. Using factual copyrighted content (e.g. news reports) is usually considered more fair than fictional content (e.g. movies).
The ratio of copyrighted content to your own content. You'll have a better chance of claiming fair use if you only use a few bits and pieces of the copyrighted content, and the vast majority of the video is your own work.
Harm done to the potential profits of the copyright holder. If your video can be perceived to cause a negative impact on the owner's profits, you are less likely to be eligible for fair use. Parody is the main exception to this.

, A copyright strike will stay in effect for six months on your account. During this time, you'll lose access to certain YouTube features, such as uploading videos longer than 15 minutes. This is your only course of action if the copyright claim was legitimate and you did in fact violate a copyright when posting the video.


During the wait, you'll need to complete the YouTube Copyright School by watching a video and answering a few questions at youtube.com/copyright_school.
If you receive another copyright strike during this waiting period, your six month waiting period will restart.
If you receive three strikes, your account will be terminated.

, If possible, contacting the claimant may be quicker than appealing your strike. If the claimant has a YouTube account, use the private message function to send them a message. If a corporation or other entity filed the claim, you'll need to find and contact their copyright department.


Be polite when requesting a retraction, and clearly explain why you believe the strike was a mistake. Don't just say ""fair use;"" give evidence for why you believe the claim to be wrong.
The claimant is under no obligation to retract the copyright strike claim.

, If you believe your video does not violate fair use, or you think the copyright strike was an error and you don't actually use copyrighted material, you can file a counter-notification.This is a legal claim. By filing a counter-notification, the claimant will be able to see your personal information, and you open yourself up to lawsuits.
The counter-notification takes ten days to process. The claimant may file a court order during this time to keep your video offline.

, If you decide you want to submit a counter-notification, you can do so from the Copyright Notices section of your account (youtube.com/my_videos_copyright). All of the videos that you have received strikes for will be listed here.


If you see a ""Matched third party content"" or ""Video blocked"" message next to a video, this is a Content ID claim, and is handled differently than a copyright strike. See the next section for details.

, This will begin the submission process.

, You will be warned that you should not proceed unless you are prepared to take your case to court. You should only proceed if you are sure that your video should not have received the strike.


Check the ""I have read the above statement"" box to reveal the form.

, You'll need to enter your real name, address, and phone number. This information will be made available to the claimant.


If you have a lawyer, you can enter your lawyer's contact information instead.

, Enter in your reasoning for why your video falls under fair use, or why it was mistakenly identified. You don't have a lot of room in this field, so be clear and to the point. This will not be sent to the claimant.

, You can include a message to the claimant as well. You may want to reiterate why you're filing the claim, so that they can retract the claim if necessary. Avoid attacks in this message.

, This will make the form legally binding. You'll need to agree to all of the statements to proceed.

, The process takes about ten days to complete. If your video is found to be covered under fair use or was mistakenly identified, it will be restored and the strike removed from your account. If the claim is denied, the video will stay offline and the strike will remain. In very rare cases, you may be sued by the claimant to keep the video offline.


If you are unable to submit an online counter-notification because your account has been disabled, you can send one via email, post, or fax. Include your name, address, phone number, video URL, and signature. Make sure to also include the two required statements on this page, where you can also find the mailing address and fax number.

YouTube is not a pornography site. Please, keep it clean and appropriate! Do not upload images involving body parts or people having sex. YouTube just is not the right website for such. Such videos will be deleted, so do not waste your time.

YouTube is not a plagiarism board. Do not upload videos that do not consist of your help of production. In other words, do not upload the video if you did not make the video yourself or if it came from another company.
YouTube is not for violence. Do not upload videos that violate the safety and/or privacy of other people.
YouTube is not a hate campaign. Do not upload any videos that are damaging, threatening or violent (for example, “I’m gonna blow your brains out.”) Such videos will be deleted.

First of all, many people who write hurtful messages about the way you look or talk may be jealous.,
Another thing may be the fact that they may get paid to write spammy stuff like this:

"" I love your music!,

Another kind of unwanted comment is one user that keeps commenting a video of yours!,

If you have a YouTube account, make a second one, or make two more.,
Find a video to talk to yourself on.,
On one of your two accounts, say something that would likely go against the opinions of the people who are watching the video.,
Log out of your account and log into your second account, go back to the video, and change character - then reply to the comment you left with your first account with an opposing message, like ""You idiot, this film looks bloody awesome."",
Switch characters and accounts back and forth to pretend to have an argument over it!,
As more people get involved, you might notice other people starting to have a bit of a row with each other.,
If you want to make this joke even more diverse, make another account and throw in a third character.,
The funny thing is, nobody will know it's one person.,
If you want to, you can have your two account characters ""make up"".,
Once you've had enough, just abandon the video.",How to Talk to Yourself on YouTube," If you haven't made a YouTube account yet, make two. Simple as.;
, The best videos to do this are ones where a lot of people are debating on the quality of something, such as a music video or a film trailer. Find a video with a high amount of views to ensure that it's being viewed frequently (but not so frequently that comments are appearing every few seconds).

, Say anything you want - after, all, you're going to argue with yourself. Here's an example. On a movie trailer, say something like ""Gee, this film is going to be awful."" even if you think the film looks good.

,

, Make it long and detailed to get people's attention. Then, if anybody argues with you (""Stop fighting guys!"") just use both your accounts to argue with other people: ""But he started it!"" *switch account* ""No, HE started it!""

, As you continue talking to yourself remember to have one account make friends, the other make enemies, and vice versa. Attempt to get people to join each side to flesh it out. Depending on how much there is a debate on the video it might be difficult, but try your best. Then just watch the chaos unfold.

, The third character could be a mature person who's trying to sort the other two characters out.

, It can't be proven, especially, if you make both channels invisible, and if anybody seems suspicious, just have one of your accounts say ""I'm the same guy as that loser?! No way!"" and the other say ""Too right, I wouldn't want to be like him!""

, Because you are in control you can take the joke to any extent you wish. Whether you let everybody know that you were playing pretend with yourself all along is up to you. It's not really a good idea, but some might find it funny, so go ahead if you want to.

, Next time you feel like doing it again, just find another video and start over from scratch.

Redirect your need for gratification.,
Find a different hobby.,
Play a sport.,
Play music.,
Establish internet-free zones.,
Go on a tech vacation.",How to Stop Being a YouTube Addict1," Addiction happens when you start to need a particular stimulant to feel good or fulfilled. Explore other, more positive and healthy alternatives to achieve the gratification you seek.;
, Finding something else to do that will take your mind off all those oh-so-watchable videos is ideal.


Arts and crafts. You’ll find that making stuff, even if it’s just silly paper mache sculptures or origami, will not only help relieve your need for endless video gratification, but will make you feel much more fulfilled. Painting or drawing. Creating is positive; watching endless videos is not. You can gain a sense of real fulfillment by engaging in creative arts, while simultaneously removing yourself from the situation (i.e. having nothing better to do, or even having a void in your life) that is causing your video addiction. , Getting outside and getting physical is one of the best alternatives to engaging in an unhealthy, addictive behavior. Not only will your physical health improve, but getting involved in a team sport is beneficial for your social, mental, and emotional well-being. If you don’t have friends interested in playing, you can always just show up at a local park with a basketball and shoot some hoops.
Find a local intramural league for your sport of choice.
Locate a local establishment for some shuffleboard, chess, checkers, or even “cornhole” if you’re not into the more physical sports.

, Musical creativity is another great alternative that can have benefits aside from helping with your addiction. Get friends interested in playing music with you. This is another way to benefit your social life while eliminating your addictive behavior. Playing music not only can help you treat your addiction directly, but also has benefits such as refining your time management and organizational skills, which can in turn help you manage what you do other than losing yourself in YouTube. If you used to play an instrument, dust it off and start practicing again.
Take music lessons. Always wanted to sing better? There are lots of voice coaches out there. Rather than watching YouTube videos, tape yourself playing or singing and post videos of your creativity.

, When you’re addicted to a something on the web, such as YouTube, it’s a good idea to implement areas in your daily life that are completely free from the internet, or even better, all tech. Leave the phone or tablet at home when you’re going out for a hike or a walk around the lake. Even though we think we’re doing something solely outdoors or generally active, there are usually still opportunities, even, say, camping, for logging on for some of those addictive videos.
When you go to lunch at work, take a magazine or book to the cafe instead of your tablet; even if you're planning to read a book on that Kindle Fire, it’s way too easy to start browsing the videos as well.

, There are actually camps where you can go with the sole purpose of freeing yourself from the need for internet, networking, and social media. Getting out and having a week or even a day or two with absolutely no access can be great for breaking the cycle.
Getting completely away from the ability to feed your addiction can help you control your use, rather than having to live completely tech-free. "

Delete all apps and bookmarks.,
Deactivate your account.,
Block the site.",How to Stop Watching YouTube1," Get rid of temptation by deleting any one-click links and icons that you have on your computer and mobile devices. Force yourself to start typing each letter in the web address whenever temptation strikes. Give yourself more time to reconsider visiting the site before you get there.

Since YouTube is a pretty popular site, the autofill feature in browsers will likely suggest it after the first couple of letters. Make a point of filling in the whole address on your own. Always give yourself more time to back out.;
, True, you can still watch YouTube without being logged into a personal account, but delete your account anyway. Rid yourself of all the channels that you’ve curated over time. Force yourself to spend more time searching for videos if temptation leads you back there. This way you have more time to reconsider what you’re doing. To deactivate your account:Open the Account link in the YouTube menu.
Select “Delete Account.”
Type in why you’re closing the account when prompted.
Type in your password.
Click “Delete My Account.”

, If you find yourself succumbing to temptation again and again, prevent yourself from being able to visit the site at all. Open the settings to your Internet browser, search for its blocking features, and add YouTube to the list. If needed, download the appropriate add-on for your browser if it doesn’t allow blocking as part of its original features.Internet Explorer and Opera should allow you to block sites without needing to download any add-ons.
Firefox may require you to download the add-on LeechBlock.
Chrome may require you to do the same with StayFocused.

Block YouTube on your computer.,
Limit your computer time.,
Take control of your computer time.,
Get computer work done first.",How to Stop Being a YouTube Addict2," If you want to make a clean break, have a friend or parent set a block password on your computer so that you won’t be able to access YouTube. , Put a strict personal limit on how much time you spend with your eyes on a screen- it’s generally considered unhealthy to spend more than four hours a day in front of a computer. Excessive computer use can lead to various issues, such as:


Musculoskeletal problems.
Headache.
Repetitive stress injuries.
Vision problems. , If your addiction is in the early stages, you may be able to gradually lessen your need by managing your computer time.

, Within your allotted computer time, make sure you take care business first, before going on to YouTube videos. One of the benefits of breaking your addiction is that you will be in control of your time- rather than your addiction being in control of you.


Get time management software. There are programs available that can track your time spent on different applications, so you can have an accurate idea of what you’re spending the most time doing (or not doing). Use an “internet nanny” service, such as Net Nanny or K9 web protection. These are parental control programs which can set blocks on certain websites, or control the amount of time certain applications are available each day. Use the internet to further yourself, rather than getting swept up in entertainment for instant gratification. The internet is a gold mine of current information, history, and every other kind of knowledge there is. Use it to learn. "

Accept that you have an addiction.,
Recognizing alienation.,
Examine your health.,
Be aware of excuses.,
Realize when there are consequences on your life.",How to Stop Being a YouTube Addict3," Just like with any addiction, the first step is recognizing you have a problem. YouTube attracts millions of viewers, and it can be easy to start spending much more time than you ever intended watching videos. . Recognizing the early signs of addiction in yourself is crucial to treating the problem.

, Are you pushing away friends or family, those who care about you? When someone is addicted, be it to drugs, alcohol, video games, or even YouTube videos, one of the first behaviors they tend to exhibit is only wanting to be around those who enable their addictive behavior. , Addiction, even if it has nothing to do with substances, often causes one’s health to suffer.


Has your bodily hygiene gotten worse? Have you begun to neglect your hair, nails, teeth?
Look at your eating habits. Behavioral addiction can lead to less awareness of the sustenance you are putting into your body.
Do you have sudden mood changes? Irritability, especially when you are unable to engage in your addiction, depression, and anger can be signs that you have a problem. , Another sign that there is a problem is a tendency to make excuses or rationalize why it’s OK to continue with your addictive behavior.


Non-addicts will see a negative behavior and want to eliminate it.
If you have an addiction you may find yourself rationalizing why it’s not a problem-which can mean that it is. , If you’ve begun to reach the middle or late stages of YouTube addiction, you will begin to experience a detrimental effect on other, more positive aspects of your life.


Is your work suffering? Do you ever miss work as a result of your need for video streaming?
Do you spend less time engaging in other physical activities? Often an addiction will lead to a sharp decrease in time spent exercising, going to events, or other social and physical activities. "
"
Hide apps and bookmarks.,
Block the site selectively.,
Designate device(s) for YouTube viewing.",How to Stop Watching YouTube2," Of course, as addictive as YouTube might be, you may still have valid reasons for watching certain videos. If you’re looking to spend less time on casual viewing only, bury apps and bookmarks in new folders. Hide them so the icons and links aren’t there to greet and tempt you first thing.

With phones or tablets, you can also take the added step of creating additional pages to your home screen. Banish the YouTube app to the last one, well away from those you use the most, so you have to swipe a ridiculous number of times to reach it.

, Maybe your problem is that YouTube distracts you when you’re supposed to be concentrating on something else, like work or studies. If that’s the case, go to the site-blocking settings in your browser or its add-on. Then, instead of having it block the site all the time, enter a start- and end-time to block it during those hours that are supposed to be devoted to other activities.There are also numerous apps available for download to accomplish this.

, Part of what makes YouTube so addictive is that it’s available on so many devices. Pretend that isn’t the case. Choose just one or two to use for YouTube while eliminating it from all the others. Which to choose will depend on your situation. For instance:

If your job or studies require you to watch or post videos, designate your computer as your sole YouTube device. Then refrain from watching it on your TV, phone, or tablet.
If you need it for, say, video tutorials on DIY projects around the house, designate a single mobile device as your tool instead.

"
"
Write down what you intend to do online before starting.,
Plan other activities.,
Divert your attention to something else.,
Keep track of your relapses.",How to Stop Watching YouTube3," Whenever you need to use the Internet, jot down what you plan to do on a piece of notepaper first. Keep this with you when you sit down at the computer (or even hold it in your other hand if you’re using a phone). Give yourself an itemized to-do list so you have a plan to stick to. This will make it harder to stray into temptation.This is also a good idea whenever you’re working on a device connected to the Internet, even if you don’t intend to go online.

, If you tend to watch YouTube at a certain time of day, fill that time slot with a new activity. Busy yourself with new habits to avoid lapsing back into the old ones. Ensure success by choosing something that doesn’t require a device. For instance, you could:Create or adjust your exercise schedule to fill that time slot.
Dedicate that time to reading a book, newspaper, or magazine.
Cook meals in advance for the days or week ahead.
Enroll in a class or group activity that meets at that time.

, Keep a to-do list of stuff that needs to be taken care of around. Then, whenever you find yourself a click away from wasting the next half hour on YouTube, refer to that list to find something else to occupy yourself immediately. Failing that, come up with some fallback activities that you can do instead of succumbing to temptation, like:Calling, texting, messaging, or emailing friends or family that you haven’t reached out to in a while.
Stepping away from your device for some impromptu exercise, like pushups, situps, or even just taking a walk.
Engaging in some other interest or hobby of yours, like writing, painting, or playing an instrument.

, If you do find yourself back on YouTube, grab a piece of notepaper, write down the date and time, and make a tick for each video that you watch. Save this and add to it every time you stray back to the site. Create a visual record of your relapse to keep track of your progress, as well as identify any patterns to your success and/or failures. For instance:Say you find yourself back on YouTube at roughly the same time each Saturday. Now you know to block the site during those hours and/or make a point of planning another activity.
Now say you find that you do pretty well in staying off YouTube all day long on Sunday. Now you can model other days of the week with a similar schedule to mirror that success.

Make your first video.,
Plan ahead with plenty of buffer space.,
Come up with a variety of ideas.,
Create videos that have some relevance to recent news.,
Focus on the cute.,
Keep it simple.,
Use good filming techniques.",How to Start and Maintain a Successful YouTube Career2," Choose a subject to talk about, particularly a subject that you know well or have a strong opinion about. You may want your first video to be an introduction to your channel and give people a taste of what you have to offer them.


For example: Tell your viewers about future topics, dates on which your next videos will come out, and the bottom line is make them want more of you.

, Future dates and ideas means having a plan in place at least several months ahead. Draw one up and follow it fairly closely, with a bit of flexibility to meet viewers' requests, etc. Keep buffer space for the times when you're going to be too busy, too budget-crunched or even unwell or dealing with personal issues to be making a video.


If you know you will not have time in the future to make or upload a video consider making it now and scheduling it in YouTube for a future date.
Quality over quantity is often the best aim.

, If you cannot think of something to talk about or do, watch other videos and gather ideas. After watching some videos you may be inspired to make a video response or even a spoof of their original video.


Don't copy other people's ideas. Parody is usually okay, as it is a common form of artistic expression that is not considered copying. But pretending another person's video script is also yours, for example, is copying.
Some great ideas that have worked in the past are; prank videos, product reviews, how to videos, reaction videos, game play videos, makeup & shopping haul videos, video memes, unboxing videos.
If you want to make a video that does not require much editing and can be done in real time, for example a video of you playing the latest computer game, then consider live streaming it. That way you will be able to interact with viewers which will help build an audience base, and YouTube favors live streams and will rank it higher in search results during the stream.

, Make video responses to well known or popular videos. These are topics that are currently being searched for a lot on YouTube and in Google search, making a video relevant to these topics have a good chance of being found.


You can find the latest topics by going to Google News or the trending topics section of Twitter.

, Kittens, puppies, babies, laughing babies, children doing hilarious things, smiling, hugging, etc. are the sorts of things human beings are suckers for. Somehow, there is always room for more! Find the sorts of things your viewers like by way of cuteness, and keep delivering.


Cute videos have a high sharing potential on social media, everyone loves seeing cute videos in their news feed. Make sure you share these kinds of videos on social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for a chance of your videos going viral.

, Once you've cottoned onto an idea that works for you, don't embellish it or deviate from it too much. People like a certain style and brand when they start subscribing and will expect more of the same style as you add more. Of course, this doesn't mean you can't grow and change for the better; it just means don't leap from punk one week to preppy the next. (Unless, of course, that really is your channel's idea!)

, Natural light is the best lighting you can use when filming for YouTube. Successful YouTubers use studio type lights or white lights, which also give you good lighting. But natural lighting is the best. Make sure you have the lights facing you and not behind you. Be aware of where shadows are and make sure they are not covering the main focus point of your videos.

Backgrounds are also good to have. You don't want a dark and dingy background or a background that blends in with you outfit, you can buy or make backgrounds. To purchase a cheap background, go on eBay or other selling sites to find a great background. Alternatively you can film you videos outside at places like the beach, your local park, or even your backyard.
Consider purchasing a green screen, this way you will be able to make your own backgrounds for your videos.

Film with a good quality camera.,
Record with a high quality screen recorder.,
Choose good tags.,
Try to get lots of subscribers.,
Don't spam.",How to Start and Maintain a Successful YouTube Career3," Webcams are out. The video and audio quality are not very good on webcams, so try to invest in a good video camera. It doesn't have to be a $500 camera, it could cost $20 as long as the quality for audio and visuals are good your video will be good too.


Many digital cameras now have excellent video capacity.
Look for used options on auction sites or classifieds if you haven't a lot of money to spare. Some great sites to find used cameras are eBay and Craigslist.
The latest mobile phones are also capable of creating good videos.
Consider using a tripod to avoid having a shaking video effect.

, This only applies if your video involves you recording your screen. HD video's are the norm nowadays, so make sure it can record at 720p or above.


It is best to invest in one rather than download a free one as they often have a ""Free Trial"" or ""Demo"" watermark across the screen on export.
If your screen recorder does not have options to record audio as well then you need to invest in a good quality microphone - or another screen recorder. One many YouTubers use is the ""Blue Snowball"" or ""Blue Yeti"", but any cheap, high quality microphone will do the job.

, Choosing tags is a pretty important step to the video upload process, choosing popular tags will make it harder for people to find your video. Choosing unique but accurate tags should bring you more views.


Use concise titles, descriptions and tags. YouTube sorts videos out based on the title of the video, the description and then the tags, in that order.
Consider which search terms you would like your video to be displayed under and also use those search terms in the title, description and tags.
Place tags in your description as well as it is more likely that you will get views on your YouTube video.
For example: If you were uploading a video about what you thought of Lil Wayne's music career, you wouldn't just put ""Lil Wayne"" because there would be too many results to sort through. But if you were to put Lil Wayne, Cash Money, Music, Career, and History, you would probably end up with a lot more views; not because there are more tags than just Lil Wayne but because it really narrows the search results down.

, Having subscribers is one of the most important things to have while on Youtube. When someone subscribes to a channel, they become your fan; this can be very rewarding to some people.


To gain subscribers: On every YouTube channel there is a box, called a description box. Many people take this space for granted but anytime someone views your channel they will see what you write there, so you may want to give clues about future videos or tell a little about yourself, if you write some good convincing material this can be a great way to gain subscribers.
To keep subscribers: The best way to keep subscribers is to always keep your word. For example, if you say your video will be out on Friday, you make sure you have a video posted by Friday (see the ""planning"" discussion above). Another way to keep subscribers is to have a steady pace of videos, like one per week, two per week, or whatever it may be; just keep it reliable.
A quick and easy way to get subscribers or even views is to use an online service that offers YouTube promotion. However by buying subscribers or views you are not guaranteed that these people will have many interactions with your account. If you use this method never give out your YouTube password and always choose safe payment methods such as PayPal.

, People will find you, there is no need to spam. The only thing spamming will do for your YouTube career is ruin your credibility and reputation. Spamming includes constantly commenting on other peoples videos with the same message, or something irrelevant to their videos. Or mass sending messages that promote a single video.

"
"
If you want to do reviews on your channel, keep up with the latest version or item that interests you.,
Add your own personal touch, don't use the same thing as other YouTubers.,
Keep your review as non-biased as possible.,
Don't get too excessive with the bad opinions.",How to Start and Maintain a Successful YouTube Career4," Don't get too off-topic; this risks becoming it boring and viewers will click out. Keep your video simple.


If you want to discuss a longer topic, choose wisely and only talk about the topic. Again try to keep it simple and short.
If you really want to go for a long topic, make them into smaller parts and serve them as different videos, such as ""Part 1, Part 2"" etc. That will make the viewers that enjoyed the first one go for the second one.
If you are planning to make parted videos, make a video that act as a hub for viewers, such as having a short video which links to the different parts.
To promote interactions on your video ask people to comment with their thoughts on the product you were reviewing.

, Create your own online persona and stick to it.

, Have a descriptive opinion on it.


Try to compare it to other similar products.
Talk about the differences and what you like about it and what you don't.
If your review videos are already getting a lot of views then consider asking brands to provide you with new or unreleased products for you to review. This will give your videos an edge.

, It may offend some people, so keep it descriptive and stick to the facts.

Gain some confidence.",How to Start and Maintain a Successful YouTube Career5," YouTube can be a great place but can also be a very demoralizing and nasty place when the haters get involved. No matter what you do, no matter what you look like, there are people out there who will say negative things to try to make their lackluster little lives more interesting as they hide behind the shield of not being seen. The best thing to do when receiving a nasty comment is to delete their comment, block the commenter and never respond to them. You don't want to give them the satisfaction for being an idiot. Keep your head held high and don't let anybody bring you down.


Decide whether you'll even leave a video open to commenting. It's not always the right thing to give people air space to trivialize or downgrade your hard work.
Don't take any of the snarly, self-centered comments personally. Some people really get enthused about being creepy and picky online. Don't give them the time of day. Civility is the byword.
Whenever anyone starts up on the ""freedom of speech"" spiel, gently remind them that they're already exercising it. It's become a standard bore to read this baseless whine in nasty criticism.
Focus more on the positive comments rather than the negative ones.

Decide what you want your group to be about.,
Make a YouTube account.,
Click Accounts -> Groups -> Create a Group.,
Fill out your group information.,
Invite your friends.,
Collaborate on content.,
Upload videos regularly.,
Make your group known.",How to Start a Group on YouTube," Before you get started with making the YouTube group itself, you should have some idea what you would like to accomplish with it. The more specific, the better. If you choose to specialize in something, you'll have a much better chance of standing out from all the other groups on YouTube. , Chances are you already have a YouTube account if you're reading this. If not, then do so before you think of making a group. It's easy and free.

, Once you're logged into your spiffy YouTube account, it's pretty easy to get to creating a group. Put your cursor over 'Account' at the top of the screen. From there, click on the 'more...' option that becomes available. From there, go to the Groups tab, and lastly, 'Create a Group'.

, From here, you can fill in a form that will forge the basis of your group. Fill in the requested data. Picking out a great name in particular can make or break your group. Pick something witty that aptly describes in a few characters what your group is going to be all about.

, Once you have the basic group set up, it's time to lure others to the fold. While some may recommend you invite as many people as possible for the best results, it's generally better to be selective at first, adding people you think will be just as interested in the topic as you are. A group with less people to start will make those invitees feel more exclusive, and thus more likely to keep returning.

, The most enjoyable thing about being in a YouTube group is the fact that you can collaborate with people with the same interests as yourself. What kind of stuff are you guys mutually into? Better yet, what do each of you bring to the table? How might it be translated into top-notch content for your particular area? Get together and decide what you're going to want to do together. If you're doing a Let's Play video for example, maybe get two people to write and perform the dialogue, and a third person to do the editing magic.

, Once you've got a strong core of members, it's just as important you keep your group consistently busy and active. Uploading at least weekly is a good idea. Getting that rate up to daily is even better once you have a steady following, but might not be worth the time or effort if you don't have many subscribers yet. Above all, give viewers the impression that your group is alive and well.

, Now that you've got the basics of your group built up, it's time to get a following! You and the other members of your group should share and promote the group via social media and other available outlets. Once you reach a certain threshold of active subscribers and gain a reputation for high quality (or at least engaging) material, you'll find your following will increase naturally.

This means every Roku device except the original Roku (released in 2010) can now add the YouTube channel.Note: Roku's model-naming system can be very confusing. The original Roku launched in 2010, and the Roku 2 launched in 2011. After the Roku 2 came out, they released a new Roku 1 and Roku 2 in 2013. This means that the Roku 1 and the original Roku are actually two completely different models.If you have the original Roku from 2010, the only way to get YouTube videos is to install the Twonky channel, which requires a subscription.;

The browser you choose shouldn't affect your experience. You may even be able to reach the YouTube site on a different browser you've downloaded (like, for instance, the UC Browser.)However, if you experience problems with one, you may want to try the other. If neither works, try one of the alternative app solutions listed in the section below.;
, In the browser’s address bar, type in m.youtube.com. This should take you to the YouTube mobile site, which is optimized for the mobile viewing experience.


If you cannot reach m.youtube.com, you may have a problem with your phone's wi-fi settings. Try using a computer to browse the official support pages for the C3-00 and C3-01 for additional help., Select the search bar of the mobile YouTube page, then use the C3's keyboard to type in the title of a video you want to watch or enter keywords for videos you’re interested in viewing. For example, if you want to watch music videos, type in ""music videos"". Click the phone's ""enter"" button or select the search button in the browser window to continue.

, You should now see a list of videos that match your search terms. Select a video from a list of search results. Click the title of the video and the video should begin to load. Enjoy your video!


It bears mentioning that you may want to keep your expectations for your video-viewing experience in check — though C3 series phones can play a variety of video formats, they only have a 320 × 240 pixel display and a limited amount of internal memory — thus, video quality and loading speeds are unlikely to be as good as they are on newer mobile devices."

While the official YouTube app doesn't work on Nokia C3 phones, you can download alternative apps from the Ovi Store that allow you to find and watch the same videos.


Connect to the Ovi Store by selecting Menu > Store from the phone's home screen. The ""Store"" option will look like a blue shopping bag.
Once you connect to the Ovi Store, you can use the magnifying glass option to open the search bar and start looking for video apps. Download and install the app of your choice. Below are a few recommendations that should work on Nokia C3 phones according to the official Ovi Store website.Other apps may work as well.

, Vuclip is a stripped-down video application designed to work on any phone and any network — including economy feature phones like the Nokia C3. Best of all, Vuclip indexes YouTube videos — this means that you can search for YouTube videos on Vuclip even though you may not have the YouTube app itself.

, YouTube Downloader is designed to do just what it sounds like — let you download YouTube videos to your phone so that you can watch them whenever you want. However, because C3 phones have limited built-in storage, the amount of video you'll be able to store at any one time will probably be small unless you use an external storage device.


Note that Nokia C3 phones use MicroSD cards for external storage. Using MicroSD cards, Nokia C3 phones can have up to 8GB of additional storage space., Video HD bills itself as an HD video app for YouTube. Video HD users can search and watch videos with an app interface that bears many similarities to the official YouTube app. In spite of the Nokia C3 phones' limited video capabilities, Video HD is still listed as an app that will work on C3 phones on the official Ovi Store website."

It's slightly easier with phones if you're trying to feel less embarrassed. Just be yourself. If people stare, stop, hold what you were saying and move away from them if possible. If that's not possible, just keep going. If it's a randomer, what are the chances of you seeing that randomer again?

, Each time, just give updates. You could say, So we're going to Tescos now to get some apples, pears and bananas. In the shops, vlog what you like. For example, say you were in Superdrug and liked a certain eyeshadow, you could say, ""I'm in Superdrug and just look at this eyeshadow. It's the, (insert name of eyeshadow), it looks amazing."" If you enter a restaurant, vlog before you order and say what restaurant you're in. Just the name, not the location. Then, look over the menu on the vlog and tell your viewers what you're planning on ordering. Then, say what you did order, and show it.

, This is known by the beauty gurus as a haul. Describe each item, where you got it and how much it was.

, Vlog your activities, what you watch on TV, say the names of the shows and what TV channel they are on and any other things you do. For example, what bath bombs you put in your bath, etc.

, Say something like, ""So that's the end of this vlog, give it a thumbs up and I'll see you soon"", or ""I'm gonna end my vlog here, hope you enjoyed it"", and end your video for the day.

, Import your footage onto your computer. If you used a phone, you can download or purchase an editor, but it may be easier to put the clips on the computer. Then go off, and start the next day's vlog. Some point in the day, edit your footage from the previous day together and render and upload it. Title it something exciting, from something that happened in your day. For example: Giant Pizzas & Beautiful Makeup.

, Only keep the footage from the day you're currently filming. This saves space on your device.

, Congratulations, you're in on it.

Download the file.",How to Rip Music from YouTube2," If you intend to rip audio from a lot of different videos, it may be more convenient to download a conversion program. These typically work faster and allow you to get more videos converted in a shorter amount of time. Conversion programs may also provide a higher-quality audio file than online converters. Popular programs include:


DVDVideoSoft YouTube to MP3 Converter
MediaHuman YouTube to MP3 Converter
YTD YouTube Converter & Downloader

, After downloading the setup file, you will need to run it to begin installing the program. Be very careful when installing these programs and read each screen thoroughly. Oftentimes these programs attempt to install browser toolbars and other adware unless you specifically uncheck boxes during the installation process.


If adware gets installed without your permission, use this guide to get rid of it.

, Load the video that you want to extract audio from and copy the URL from the browser's address bar.

, Open your newly-installed downloader program and paste the URL into it. The video will be loaded and you will be shown your download options.

, Most conversion programs will allow you to specify the quality of the audio. The highest quality files will also take the most space on your drive, so weigh the benefits and choose the quality that works best for you. If you don't like how it sounds, you can always download and convert it again at a higher quality.

, MP3 files have tags that identify Artist, Album, Release date, and more. Most programs will try to fill these tags automatically, but you can edit them yourself if you'd like. Before you start downloading, select ""Tags"" from the Downloads menu and fill out the fields as you see fit.

, By default, converted audio will be placed in your Music folder. You can change this by clicking Tools and then selecting Options. Click the Output tab, and then specify the folder that you want converted audio to be sent to.

, Once you have chosen your quality settings, you can start the download process. The video will be downloaded and then converted. Depending on the length of the video, this could take a few minutes, but will almost always be faster than using a web interface.


You can queue multiple files by pasting multiple URLs into the downloader program. Each program handles multiple files in different ways, but in general they all allow queuing.
Your file will be downloaded to the folder that you specified. You can then add it to your media library or transfer it to your Android phone or iPhone/iPod.

Never before has it been so easy and affordable to reach such a broad audience so quickly. That said, how about filming an alfresco reading to promote all the wonderful things about your book and your Canadian province at the same time? Then how about posting that reading on YouTube for others to enjoy?;
, When choosing a chapter or series of poems to include in their video readings, authors should keep in mind that the shorter the file is, the better. There are two primary reasons for this: it is easier to hold the attention of one's audience for briefer amounts of time, so a smaller video will improve the chance of others watching it to the very end; and YouTube limits video uploads to fifteen minutes in length and two (2) GB file sizes for standard account holders.

Wait about 20 minutes.",How to Prepare and Create a YouTube Series and Video," Before starting a series or video, be sure to have the right number of people, and that those people don't get your video off-task and won't fool around.;
, Be sure to have cameras, a PC (for uploading and editing), an Internet connection, and more things you'll need are listed under that category.

, Start filming your film, video, or show correctly and in the right places. YouTube has now increased the video time limit to the quite big number of infinity, but you should still keep your video at 2 to 15 minutes due to human's concentration limit.

, Even though no errors were made in your filming process, you still may want to edit it to cut breaks and gaps. If desired, you can add music, pictures, and put different filmed scenes in order if necessary. This way, when watching the completed version, it will seem like it's going right to it.

, Go to YouTube and click Upload in the upper-right hand corner of the home page. Follow the directions and describe the video, and set all the things you need to set.

, After 20-30 minutes, after you clicked upload video and describing it, your video should appear in public view. If not, YouTube will explain why, and you can take steps to fix the problem.

Find the video you want to slow down on YouTube.,
Look for the settings button in the YouTube player.,
Select one of the slower options from the ""Speed"" menu.,
If you don't see the slowdown option, use the HTML 5 player.,
Use the space bar for a makeshift ""frame-by-frame"" feature.",How to Play YouTube Videos in Slow Motion1," To get started, simply open the YouTube video that you'd like to view in slow motion. It doesn't matter how you get to it — you can use the search bar, the video's URL, or even find it embedded in an outside web page.;
, Once the video loads and any ads have finished, look in the bottom right corner of the video. You may see a small button that looks like a gear or cog. If you do, click this button.


Don't worry if you don't see this. As you'll see below, you can still view YouTube videos in slow motion even if this button doesn't display at first.

, Clicking the settings button will cause a small menu to pop up from the corner of the video. Click the menu next to ""Speed"" to choose the speed you'd like to play the video at. The two slow-motion options are:



0.5: Will play the video at half speed. The audio track will play as well, but it will be greatly distorted from the slow-motion effect.

0.25: Will play the video at quarter speed. The audio track will not play.

, Depending on the browser you're using, you may not be able to see the settings option to adjust the playback speed at first. The most common reason for this is that you are using the default Flash YouTube player rather than the upgraded HTML5 version. To turn on the HTML5 player, visit youtube.com/html5. If the HTML5 player isn't already enabled, you should see the option to opt in., At one point, the YouTube player allowed the option to move back and forth in the video one frame at a time by using the J and L buttons. However, this feature has since been removed. However, because the space bar still acts as a play/pause button, you can partially recreate this function.


Click the video once to select it. This will also pause it. If it is paused, click it twice.
Hit the space bar to play the video. Hit it again to pause. For a ""frame-by-frame"" effect, hold down the space bar to rapidly switch between play and pause.
Set the video to 0.25 speed and use the space bar for the closest thing to frame-by-frame possible with the basic YouTube player.

Visit RowVid.com.,
Paste the URL of the YouTube video you want to slow down.,
Use the speed options below the video player to slow down the video.,
Use the < and > buttons to move frame-by-frame.",How to Play YouTube Videos in Slow Motion2," Another way to watch YouTube videos in slow motion is to use an external site with a slow motion feature. This is a good choice if you can't get the standard slow motion method above to work. There are many different sites that will allow you to do this, but Rowvid.com is a particularly good all-around choice.This section will use RowVid for example purposes.


Another great choice is the aptly-named Youtubeslow.com.One big advantage of Youtubeslow.com is that it works on mobile devices.


, On the main Rowvid screen, you'll see a text box in the center of the screen. Find the URL of the YouTube video you want to slow down, copy it to the clipboard, and paste it into this box. Click ""Watch Video"" to proceed.


On a Windows PC, the keyboard shortcut for copying text is Ctrl+C and the shortcut for pasting is Ctrl+V. For Macs, use Command+C and Command+V.

, On the next screen, you will see the YouTube video you've chosen load into a large player. The video will start playing automatically, but you can pause it by clicking the video as normal. Below this, you'll see various options for adjusting the speed of the video.


Clicking 0.25 and 0.5 will change the speed to quarter or half speed. 1 will change the speed to normal.
Note that you may be directed to youtube.com/html5 to change your browser settings when you try to adjust the video speed.

, One option that RowVid has that the standard YouTube player doesn't is the ability to go through a video one frame at a time. Use the > button in the bottom left to move one frame forward and use < to move one frame backward. The player will pause automatically when you click either of these options.

Write down a list of your personal traits.,
Have fun with wordplay.,
Try a one word name.,
Combine two words related to your content together.,
Define the purpose of your channel.,
Relate the name to your content.,
Target your audience in the name.,
Choose an easy-to-remember name.,
Avoid using profanity or vulgar jokes.,
Stay away from broad or cliched names.,
Do not add symbols or numbers.,
Avoid names that are already taken.",How to Pick a Good YouTube Name," Part of creating a YouTube channel is learning how to market yourself. Your channel name should say why someone should watch your videos and not someone else's. Brainstorm words that apply to you and how you want to portray yourself on this channel.Maybe you want to make a comedy YouTube channel and you describe yourself as ""mischievous,"" ""snarky,"" and ""hyperactive."" You could name yourself ""Snarky Snippets"" or ""Mr. Mischievous."";
, If your name is snappy, your audience will be more likely to remember it. Try rhyming, using alliteration, or synonyms. If all else fails, you can never go wrong with puns.Don't get too complicated or obscure with the wordplay.

Suppose you're making a cooking channel. You could name yourself ""Ready Spaghetti"" or ""Baking Bread with Betty.""
Examples of word-savvy YouTube usernames: Periodic Table of Voices, Crash Course, BoredShorts TV, and Sick Science., Trendy names are often one word related to your content. Your viewers will be more likely to remember your channel name if it's short and sweet. Scour a thesaurus for unique words, and look up their meanings in a dictionary. If the word seems to fit and feels natural when spoken aloud, you may have found your username.

Examples of simple YouTube channel names: Kurzgesagt, Flula, and Smosh., A portmanteau is a word made up of two different words. Examples of portmanteaus are ""brunch,"" ""smog,"" or ""sitcom."" Take two words that describe your channel's content and mesh them together. Try brainstorming a few different portmanteau until you create a witty one.If you're a video game channel, for example, you could combine the words ""RPG"" and ""Gamers"" to create ""RPGamers.""

, To create a popular name, you will first want to decide what your channel will offer. What do you hope to provide that nobody else can? Maybe you have a certain brand of humor, are an excellent baker, or have a brilliant idea for a web series., A relevant name will get you far in attracting potential viewers. Your name should give your audience a good idea of what your channel's about. Having a specific, relevant name will attract a larger audience.

If you're making an art history channel, for example, you might want to name it ""History Talk"" but your viewers won't know that it's about art. Naming it something specific, like ""What's Van Goghing On?,"" will help your potential audience find it.

, Understand what your prospective demographic is and and what they're looking for in a channel. Think about your target viewer's age, interests, and personal needs are.

Suppose, for example, you are making an astronomy channel.Think about words that might appeal to space fans (like ""universe,"" ""asteroid,"" or ""galaxy"") and use them in your channel name. You might name your channel ""Our Breathtaking Universe"" or ""Marvels of the Galaxy.""

, Word-of-mouth is going to be crucial when expanding your platform. A complicated name will be hard for your viewers to remember or recommend to others. Pick a name that is easy to spell and remember so people can start talking about it.""Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis"" might seem like a great name for a medical YouTube channel, for example, but your audience will have a hard time pronouncing it., While you do have freedom of speech on YouTube, putting profanity in your username will seriously limit your fanbase. You may give the impression that your YouTube channel is cruder than it actually is. Keep your YouTube name tasteful, and stay away from bathroom humor., Specific names will make your channel stand out. Avoid broad names like ""Writing Tips"" or ""Movie Facts."" Make your name unique, and avoid cliches or overdone phrases. Cliches will cause your audience to tune your username out and give the impression of laziness.You can transform a YouTube name from boring to unique by giving a twist to an old cliche. Instead of ""When It's Said and Done,"" you could name your book review channel, ""When It's Read and Done.""

, A good Youtube name is easily searchable. Don't clog your username up with underscores or too many numbers. Your viewers might hear about your channel and try to search for it, only to forget a symbol and miss your channel. Usernames with letters only will look sleek and professional.

""Joseph_599485,"" for example, is going to be hard for people to remember. Pick a memorable name like, ""Yo Joseph Yo"" or ""Josephasaurus Rex.""

, Before you make your YouTube name official, run a quick internet search to make sure the name isn't taken. If someone has a YouTube channel that sounds similar to your prospective choice, try naming your channel something else. You don't want your channel constantly mixed up with another one."

In the upper portion of the screen you should see ""'s Channel.""

, Tap the icon that looks like an arrow pointing upwards. This is the upload icon that YouTube primarily uses.

, Select a video from the upload screen, the options will be slightly different for Android and iPhone users.



For iPhone Users: Select a video from your camera roll. This should be the only option available to you.

For Android Users: Choose a source. Click the Guide button (three horizontal lines) in the upper left of the screen, then choose either Recent, Videos, or Downloads


Recent shows new videos on your phone. If you just took the video, you will easily find it here.

Videos: This will show videos from all different applications which either play or record video. This includes apps like GroupMe, Snapchat, and others.

Downloads: This will show videos that you have downloaded from the web. Be aware, though, that you must have ownership of the video to upload it to YouTube. Otherwise, your video will be taken down.



, The YouTube application includes a brief trimming feature. Drag the blue circles on either side of the blue rectangle to trim down the length of your video.

, Try to make the title relevant to the content of your video. This will make it easier for people to find your video. Avoid titling the video something irrelevant just to get more views. Not only does this aggravate viewers, it also almost guarantees lower likes on your video.

, You don't have to include much in your description, but it helps viewers know what is happening in the video. For example, if your video is of fireworks on the 4th of July, think about including where you saw the show. Try to anticipate questions your viewers will have, and include answers in the description.

, You will see three different options for privacy options under the ""Privacy"" header. You can change the privacy options later on, even after uploading the video.



Private: Only you will be able to see the video. This is a useful option if you want to just have a place to store your video. It is also a useful option for testing out how a video looks on YouTube before making it public.

Unlisted: Only people with the link can view your video. This is a useful option if you only want to share your video to certain people, such as friends or family. Be aware, though, that nothing stops them from sharing the link with others.

Public: Anyone can view your video by searching for your title or by seeing it in their suggested video list.

, Tags help YouTube in determining when to show your video when a user searches for a term. For example, if you had a ""League of Legends"" tag on your video, it will be more likely to show up when a user searches for a League of Legends video. Adding tags will also make it more likely that YouTube will suggest your video to users interested in your tag.


Try to keep the tags relevant to your content. You could get a spam notification if you are too liberal with your tagging.

, If you are an Android user, press the icon that looks like an arrow pointed to the right. If you are an iPhone user, press the blue button that looks like an arrow pointed upwards.

Private: Only you will be able to see the video. This is a useful option if you want to just have a place to store your video. It is also a useful option for testing out how a video looks on YouTube before making it public.

Unlisted: Only people with the link can view your video. This is a useful option if you only want to share your video to certain people, such as friends or family. Be aware, though, that nothing stops them from sharing the link with others.

Public: Anyone can view your video by searching for your title or by seeing it in their suggested video list.

, Tags help YouTube in determining when to show your video when a user searches for a term. For example, if you had a ""League of Legends"" tag on your video, it will be more likely to show up when a user searches for a League of Legends video. Adding tags will also make it more likely that YouTube will suggest your video to users interested in your tag.


Try to keep the tags relevant to your content. You could get a spam notification if you are too liberal with your tagging.

Establish a budget.,
Consider your camera options.,
Invest in a dedicated microphone.,
Get some lighting.,
Make sure you have video-editing software available.,
Figure out your video's theme before you begin filming.,
Choose your background.,
Place your camera.,
Place your lights.,
Use the rule of thirds.,
Make sure your shooting location is quiet before filming.,
Edit your video.",How to Make Professional Quality YouTube Videos," Before you sit down to create your first video, you'll need to gather a few pieces of equipment--namely, a camera, a dedicated microphone, and lighting hardware. While this list may seem daunting, you can easily build up an equipment inventory on a budget. While establishing your budget, remember a couple of things:


Don't immediately assume you'll need the highest-quality equipment you can afford. It's better to have a cheap camera that you know how to operate than to have a $1000 DSLR that you can't make the most of.
Prioritize your equipment in this order: audio (microphone), video (camera), lighting.It's okay to improvise. For example, refrain from spending $80 on a tripod when a stack of books might better suit your videos instead.;
, Depending on your budget and the types of videos you want to shoot, you can use anything from a simple built-in webcam to a film-grade DSLR camera. Some of your simpler options include the following types of camera:



Smartphone - If you have a smartphone, you'll be able to record fairly high-quality videos with the touch of a button. Smartphones are also easier to transport than larger, bulkier cameras, meaning you can record on-the-go if you like. You can also purchase a smartphone-specific tripod for under $30 if you plan on filming vlogs or the like. The largest drawback to using a smartphone is the lack of available audio input--you'll either need to record audio separately on another device and then synchronize your video and audio later, or you'll need to settle for the in-camera microphone.

Camcorder - A camcorder is a perfect balance between a smartphone's portability and a DSLR's high-quality shooting capabilities. You can purchase a camcorder that shoots in high-definition (720p or higher) for relatively cheap--around $120--but keep in mind that you may also need to buy an additional memory card to accompany it.

DSLR Camera - Digital Single-Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras include a wide array of devices, but generally entail a high standard of quality. You'll want to tend toward high-profile brands like Canon or Nikon if purchasing a DSLR, but remember to ensure that your selected camera includes video recording as an option. Also keep in mind that DSLR cameras require a higher level of skill and patience to operate effectively. If you aren't already well-versed in DSLR camera operation, consider using a cheaper alternative., Even if your footage is beautiful, poor audio will severely detract from the overall appeal of your video. Think of it this way: you want your audio's quality to match--if not exceed--your film quality, and using your camera's built-in microphone will make it difficult to achieve this task. You'll want to look into the type of microphone your camera supports (e.g., USB) if you want to record both at the same time.


""Audio-Technica"" and ""Blue Microphones"" are both reputable companies with a wide variety of stock from cheap, accessible microphones to studio-grade ones.Spending around $100 will net you a professional-sounding microphone.
If you're working with a limited budget, consider opting for a cheaper microphone.
Using a dedicated microphone can also minimize the amount of echoing and background noise in your video since your microphone usually sits much closer to your mouth than your camera.
Consider purchasing a pop filter to place over your microphone in order to reduce audio feedback during the editing process.

, This can be anything from a desk lamp or two to a professional-grade lighting kit. For best results, you'll need to use lighting in a static location (such as a room in your house).


When setting up your lighting for a room shot, you should have three separate sources: one behind the camera (facing you), one placed 45 degrees to your left or right (facing you and the wall behind you), and one on the opposite side of the second source strictly facing the wall.You can also use natural light (e.g., a window) to illuminate your face from behind the camera, though you'll need to shoot consistently during the daytime.

, Most computers come with stock video-editing software (e.g., iMovie or Windows Movie Maker)--these will get the job done in a pinch, but you can easily download or purchase much more advanced software that will give you the control you need to produce a high-quality video.


""Wondershare Filmora"" is an excellent free option for beginners on both Mac and PC, while Lightworks caters to a more intermediate film editing audience (PC only).
If you're willing to spend some money, Apple Final Cut Pro X (Mac, $299) and Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate (PC, $129) are well-reviewed choices., While this isn't technically equipment-based, your video's conceptual focus is perhaps the most important aspect of your finished product. Before you sit down and press the ""Record"" button, know the following things about the video you want to shoot:


The subject of the video
The purpose of the video
Your target audience
Your script

, If you'd prefer to have a blank background, for example, you should shoot with your back to a blank wall. You can also put up a sheet of paper or something similar.


Your background will eventually become a key aspect of your videos if you use the same one enough. Keep this in mind when choosing your background.

, Naturally, you'll want it to face the area in which you (or your subject) will sit.


If you're using a tripod, this is a relatively easy step. Otherwise, set up a pile of books or a small shelf for your camera to rest on.
You'll also want to situate your microphone during this time. You may have to play around with your camera's zoom level and your microphone's location in order to keep the microphone out of your shot.
If you're filming with a smartphone, camcorder, or webcam, refrain from zooming in. Doing so constitutes using a ""digital zoom"" (as opposed to the optical zoom used by DSLR cameras) that distorts the video quality.

, Remember, you'll want three lights in different locations--one behind the camera, one to your left, and one to your right--for optimal visuals.


While this is a good guideline, every room is going to mandate different lighting. You'll need to experiment a bit before you find the sweet spot.

, This rule dictates that, given a set of three-by-three lines dividing the frame into ninths, the subject of your shot will fall somewhere on intersecting lines. This essentially means that you don't want to center yourself in your camera's frame--instead, sit a little bit to the left or right.


If you have a picture or something similar on the wall behind you, try sitting opposite of and below it for your shot.
Most smartphones have a camera-related option that displays a three-by-three grid of lines on the screen while filming.

, Background noise is a huge detractor from the quality of your content.

, Depending on your preferences, this process will vary. Once you've completed your shooting and editing, you're ready to upload your video to YouTube!


If you're trying to produce dynamic (e.g., quick and engaging) content, consider cutting out any awkward silences or pauses in conversation.
Most video-editing programs come with a ""noise-cancelling"" feature included. You can use this to lower the overall background noise in your video.
This is also a good point for you to add music or other effects.

, If you can, design a background yourself as it makes it far more personal and of interest to viewers who can then identify with your personal style. Once you have a suitable background, always keep specific, identifiable elements of it that represent you when you change your background, and don't change it too often.


Include links to your blog, website, etc. as part of your background and profile material. This helps viewers to gain a broader picture of who you are and what you provide online.

, When people are looking for a certain type of video, they will see many different ones when they search something. If your cover picture of the video looks bright with good editing, it will catch the person's eye and they will more likely click on your video.

, Make the titles interesting and intriguing without being over the top.

, No matter what else, avoid the poor quality video or your prospective viewers will take one look and move along. The picture and sound quality must be good to excellent, to keep the viewer interested in continuing with your work. Things to bear in mind include:


Ensure that the lighting is good. Bad lighting is irritating because there are shadows, blurry bits and an inability to focus properly. All of this suggests poor quality and soon becomes so annoying it's hard to persevere with. Film with daylight where possible or use excellent indoor lighting in the filming areas.
Don't have annoying or distracting noises in the background of videos. Such noises can make it difficult to hear your voice may over them. In general, it reduces the professional nature of your work.
Make use of sound effects. For example: If someone is meant to be slapping someone, use sound effects, so that it seems real. These help to make the video more professional.
If you're recording videos in real life, don't use your phone; use an actual camera. If you're making videos on your computer, don't use a camera; use screencasting or video capture software like Hypercam or Bandicam. If you're playing on a game console, use a capture card.

, Don't copy other videos. While it's okay to be inspired by the different ideas you come across in other videos, place your own mark on such ideas by expanding on them and mixing them up in your own way, so that your content is wholly unique and yours. Where you do rely on information from others, cite the sources and give them a kudos for an idea well executed, then borrowed by you. You'll win fans by being honest and by being supportive of other video makers.


If your videos are the exact same as other people's videos, that won't be too interesting. It's okay, to have the same general theme but make it unique. Remember that people are meant to want to copy your videos, not the other way around!
Adhere to the rules about copyright. Avoid using music, stills and video clips that are copyright unless you have the permission for them. It's demoralizing to have your video taken down because the copyright police found your content in breach of the rules.

, You don't have to plan everything you say word for word. But have a good idea of what you're going to be explaining or talking about. Planning ahead avoids things such as you stumbling or stuttering over words and so on.

, Good editing makes the difference between an amateur and a serious Youtuber. If you want to add special effects, this is the time to do so, provided they're good and make sense for the video.

, If you're all serious in your videos, it will bore people. Keep it professional but still be a little light-hearted and positive, as it helps you to connect with people and show them that you're truly likable.

, When shooting a video, don't be afraid or camera-shy. If your video is professional looking and interesting, then the only other thing needed is a confident YouTuber! The YouTube channel is yours, so don't be scared of what other people will think of you.

, See what sets them apart. Then set about promoting your personality with the same confidence and self-belief that what you have to share is worthwhile.

, If you strike a person emotionally, the person is definitely going to like you, follow you and subscribe to you. This means being a friendly, affable person, responding to your viewers in a timely and thoughtful way and being professional. Accept that there will always be detractors–-they're usually bored, lonely or puerile, so they can mostly be ignored but it someone has genuinely constructive feedback, acknowledge it politely and let the person know you've taken their feedback on board and will try it differently next time. Never be personally rude when you talk about others; you've no idea what has motivated them but it's okay to call out bad behaviors that are not appropriate without personally attacking.

, For example, Shane Dawson and Jenna Marbles are all bold. They make their videos sensational and people want to keep coming back for more.

, There's absolutely no point in having a YouTube channel unless you're going to be uploading new videos at least once a week. That way, people will be kept satisfied with new videos to watch and enjoy and they'll probably subscribe to your channel.

, Make your commentary engaging, interesting, or controversial. The more charisma and energy you put in your commentary, the more fun it is to watch!

, Do not leave negative comments for other YouTube users. This will make people go on your channel and post mean comments in return, which will drive people away from your channel. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.

, When you are promoting your channel, also write 'Subscribe. This will help you to get in touch with your viewers. Never write ""Please Subscribe to this video"". This is a direct command. Not all people love others being straightforward.

, Remember, not to add trash info/extra sweet Information. This will make you and your channel unpopular among friends.

, Once you are ready and have a solid idea. You need to have a plot outline for the season. Do this EVERY season. Write the plots for all the episodes you plan on doing. Try a minimal amount of episodes for the first season. Most do 6 for small. But if you are sure it is going to be great you can do 12.

, NEVER create a series and not plan it or release anything before the series is done.Keep in mind of what's available to you. You cannot afford to blow up a building. Think in mind of things you have that you can use in the show. Keep the episodes under 10 minutes or less.

, Camcorder, Tripod(optional), Computer, DV tape. If you have an HD camcorder it will be better quality for your show but is not necessary.

, Cast and crew. Your friends are not always the best choice. Try to ask people in drama if you go to school. Or put up flyers for an audition. If you don't own the camera then let the person who owns it operate it. If it is yours don't trust it with anyone you don't know. Make sure your cast and crew are dedicated and will do another season.

, Film your first episode then edit it. After that do it with all the other ones. Shoot the take a few times from different angles. If there are two people talking have two close ups and a wide shot. So do three takes.

, So you shot everything, all your angles. Now put it all together. Use Windows Movie Maker if you don't already have an editing software. When somebody talks cut to then if the character says something shocking cut back to the other person for their reaction. If you think your done then save it as an AVI or WMV.

, Then cut a trailer using all the episodes and put it on YouTube. Leave it until it gets a bit of interest and views. Build hype. Then if you get people interested enough put out the release date for the series. Then put out an episode every week when the series is supposed to come out.

, Then count all the views together that the episodes have and decide if you think you have enough to go for another season , or if fans are begging for more. If you think and everyone else thinks it's a good idea then repeat all this again. Have fun. And if you want to do a lot more episodes next season here is a fact, real tv series have 22 episodes per season.

Keep a regular posting schedule.",How to Make a YouTube Video," Most smartphones on the market come with two video-making essentials: A video camera feature to record videos, and a large hard drive to store them. While smartphones are portable, the audio and visual quality may be inferior to that of a dedicated video camera.


Depending on the phone you're using, the camcorder may have its own app button, or it may be contained elsewhere, typically in a sub-menu of the camera app. If you're having trouble finding your phone's camcorder function, review its instruction manual or check online.
Videos take up a lot of storage space. You may need to transfer your videos off of your phone after recording.;
, As with smartphones, most laptops made within the last 5 years come with an integrated webcam (usually just above the monitor). Webcams tend to have much poorer quality than a standard video camera, but if you can't afford to purchase a smartphone or dedicated camera, they will get the job done.


If your computer doesn't have a webcam, you can usually purchase and install one for under $20. You'll likely spend more for a higher-quality camera.

, You can find decent-quality video cameras for under $50 on Amazon, or you can spend around $120 on a high-quality video camera. Video cameras typically have better display quality than a smartphone or webcam.


Most modern video cameras have a removable SD card that can be used to transfer videos from the camera to the computer. Double-check to ensure that your selected camcorder has an SD card before purchasing it.
Avoid using VHS camcorders or Super 8 cameras, since transferring their information to a digital format on your computer is more hassle than the limited video quality is worth.

, This can be accomplished by downloading 3rd party software that will allow you to record your screen. If you're recording tutorials or video game footage, you'll want to use such a program.

Some notable options for recording your monitor are: Hyper Cam, Open Broadcast Software, XSplit, and CamStudio.
You can always purchase software to record your screen as well. Many programs also give you the option to live stream your content, so keep that in mind when searching for software.
Many programs enable you to have several videos being recorded at once. If you wish, then you can easily set up a face-cam using the previously discussed webcam. By doing so, you can record the main content while having your face-cam as an overlay on the surface of the main content. This is mainly done by streamers, but many people also use this technique for YouTube Videos.
When recording, be sure that both the audio and video are properly being recorded by first making a test clip and viewing it.

, While not imperative, good sound quality can make or break a video; to this end, relying on your recording device's built-in microphone isn't ideal. If you can find a reasonably priced microphone that is compatible with your recording device, your videos' quality will improve immensely.

Some video cameras come packaged with a dedicated microphone and all of the hardware you need to connect the two.

, While optional, doing this before settling on a video genre will help determine the kind of video you wish to record., YouTube hosts videos from millions of users, but some types of video are more popular than others:


Video blogs, or “vlogs,” are regularly-updated video series featuring the creator talking about whatever is on his or her mind, usually for 10 minutes or less.
Video game-related videos attract a fair amount of traffic, especially if you cover recent releases.
Tutorials can encompass literally any topic in which you are skilled.
Montages are videos filled with images or video clips, set to music.
Pet videos are always popular. These are typically recorded with a hand-held device, such as a smartphone or camcorder. They often feature the creator's pet doing something funny or endearing.
Reviews are video blogs that review a product or service. Being sardonic and funny when reviewing something will get more people to watch.
Comedy videos encompass a wide range of styles and approaches. They're best done with friends, and can feature anything from practical jokes, to silly dancing, to scripted sketches and beyond.

, If you'd like to share an experience with friends or relatives who can't be there to live it with you, YouTube is a great way to bridge the gap.


Plan ahead of time to film events like family picnics, weddings, and birthdays so that you'll have the raw video to edit and upload to YouTube later.
You can choose to lock a video so that only people with the specific URL (web address) of the video can view it, but that's no guarantee it won't eventually be seen by third parties. Keep the content of your video clean and in accordance with YouTube's guidelines.

, This practice is especially popular with clips that don't belong to any specific YouTube user, such as clips of old cartoons and TV shows.


If you're taking this route, you won't need video recording equipment, but you will need source files in the form of downloadable video clips. (YouTube clips aren't normally downloadable.)
These ""remix"" videos often exist in legal limbo. You're unlikely to get in any trouble for making one, but if one of the copyright holders for the original clips in your video requests that YouTube remove it from their site, they will do so immediately.

, If possible, film during the day, using natural daylight. If you're planning to do a nighttime scene, provide a little bit of light so people can see what you're doing.

If you're recording yourself, you should sit facing the light, and the camera should point toward you.
If you need alternate lighting in the room, just get a lamp, put a white lightbulb in it, put a thin cloth or sheet over the light, put it behind your iPhone/iPod/camera and point it towards your face. It should work for a good White Light! Just make sure it is not too harsh, but not too dim.
This step doesn't apply for screen-capture videos.

, Once you've settled on an idea for your video, perform whatever tasks you must to set up and prepare, then record the video.


You may have to record multiple takes. This is completely normal, especially for a beginner.
Record more than you plan to use. You can edit out the extra bits later on. There's no reason to worry too much about getting the timing perfect from the beginning.

, This serves the dual purpose of both ensuring that you make the most of your audio quality and capturing your audience's attention.

If you're using a microphone, speak directly into it. This is especially important when you're using a recording device with a built-in mic.

, Make sure you definitively press the ""Stop"" button on your selected device. Doing so will typically save your recording automatically. Now that you have your video, it's time to move the file from your recording device to your computer., For Example: Pink Walls: Don't wear anything pink or purple. But, if you have white walls, you can wear any color including white!, People will think you are unorganized and messy if your background isn't clean enough., Most likely you won't want anyone knowing where you live or what your number is., Either connect the phone to your computer, or send the video there wirelessly.

To copy files from your phone to your computer, connect the devices with a cable and use your phone's software (e.g., iTunes for an iPhone) to transfer the files.
To share the video to YouTube directly: open the YouTube app, make sure you're logged in with your Google account, tap the video camera icon, and select your video.
You can also upload your video to Google Drive and then open it from there in YouTube. You must use the Google Drive account that's tied to your YouTube Google account.

, Connect the camcorder to your computer via USB cable, or insert the SD card into your computer's SD card slot (typically located on the right or left side of a laptop's housing).


Your computer and the camcorder should both come with features to make the transfer easy. Generally speaking, all you have to do is highlight the video file(s) you want inside the window that displays the contents of your camcorder or disc, and drag the file(s) onto your desktop (Windows) or hard drive (Mac).

, Find the file where the video clips are stored and select the one(s) you want. Since they're already on your computer, there isn't much else you have to do.

, This can usually be located in the same folder that the software itself is in.

Some programs save the footage in your computer's ""Videos"" folder.

, To do so, first open it in your editing program of choice. You can research the right editing program to fit your needs and there are lots to choose from for every platform.

Several free options include:


iMovie - This app comes pre-installed on Mac platforms. It's also an iOS 10 app, meaning you can edit your video on your iPhone.

Davinci Resolve - This free editor also has professional color correction features and is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

HitFilm 4 Express - This is has a lot of features including visual effect tools and is available for Mac and Windows.


Several professional options include:


Final Cut Pro X - Costs $299 in the Apple App Store.

Vegas Pro - Originally developed by Sony and costs $399.

Adobe Premiere Pro - Licensed as a subscription service starting at $19.99 a month.



, Be sure to export the file to somewhere you can find it easily.

, This process will differ based on whether or not you choose to do so from a mobile platform., It does not matter how many viewers your videos usually have - if you don't keep uploading high-quality videos, you will likely lose subscribers, if you have any of course.

If you need a starting point for viewers, then just show the videos you make to your friends. If your friends or family find it interesting, funny, scary, weird or anything instead of boring, then your viewers might subscribe to you and even share the video with others and that means more subscribers.

, This may seem cheesy, but doing this in every video will help to create your YouTube channel, as well as showing your viewers that you are genuine.

The only possible exceptions to this rule are videos that are extremely short and/or supposed to end abruptly.

, Set goals for yourself, such as promising yourself and the audience that you will post one video every week. As your channel grows, you will probably want to start uploading multiple times per week. Or even day if your channel grows really, really huge.

Do not set unrealistic goals. Estimate how many videos you could manage to make in a certain period of time, and push your expectations back.

Pick a song for which you want to make a video.,
Determine what kinds of pictures you want to include.,
Download all of the photos into a dedicated folder.,
Open a video editing program and import your song.,
Click and drag all of your photos onto the timeline next to the song.,
Divide the number of seconds in the song by the number of photos you have to determine how long each shot should be.,
Highlight all of your photos and set the length to fit your video.,
Save your final video as an MP4 or MOV file.,
Upload the video on Youtube.",How to Make a YouTube Music Video With Pictures1," You need to have a copy of the song already on your computer in order to make your video. If you do not have the music file, you can buy it or download it online.;
, Common pictures include album artwork, shots of the band playing music, hanging out, and at live shows, and images that relate to the words currently being sung. You can even choose to put lyrics up as they're sung in certain moments. There is no wrong series of pictures to put up, but you should think about what the song says to you and how you want to portray it.


The most popular videos have photos that fit seamlessly with the music being played. Think of a theme or story in advance that you want to tell.
You can use pictures from your own life or those found online. Know, however, that it is illegal to profit off of someone else's work, so you cannot charge people for the music video unless the pictures and song are all your own., Make a folder labeled ""Music Video"" on your desktop. As you find photos, pull them into this folder. If everything is in the same place to begin with, your life will be much easier in the future. Good places to find photos include:


Stock photography sites.
Your own collections.
Online image searches.
The musician's bio or photo page.

, You can use almost any video editing software you want, from Windows MovieMaker and iMovie, to Avid and Final Cut, as these videos are simple and can be handled by most software. You can even use the most recent version of Powerpoint on Open Office, which can save presentations as movies. Click and drag your song into the timeline to determine the length of your video.

, This process is slightly different for each program, but you should end up with each photo end to end on your editing timeline. The first shot should be lined up with the start of the song.


Usually you can click and drag the files right from your folder into the editing program. If this doesn't work, try ""File"" → ""Import,"" then find the photos. Click and drag them after importing into the video work station.

, To determine the number of seconds, simply multiply 60 by the number of minutes in the song, then add the leftover seconds. Therefore, a 2:40 long song would be 160 seconds long (60x2=120, + 45 = 160). Divide this number by your photos to determine the total length of each shot. For example, if you had 80 photos for a 160 second song, you'd need each photo to last for two seconds to fit the whole video.


If you want some photos to go longer than others, you can simply use this as a guideline. Simply start with the appropriate number of seconds per photo, then adjust individual photos by hand.

, Click on all the photos by either dragging and highlighting, or Shift+Click. Right click on them and choose, ""Set Length of Clips."" Choose right amount of time for your video, depending on what you tested earlier.


It may not be labeled as ""Set Length of Clips,"" but it will be similar. Some other possibilities are: ""Duration,"" ""Clip Length,"" or ""Clip Timing.""
Some programs, like iMovie, let you change the duration of all stills, by default, in ""Preferences."" Simply set ""Duration of Stills"" to your desired length., Once you've finished your video, click on Save As or Export and choose and MP4 or MOV (Quicktime) file. These are the easiest to get onto YouTube, and they will not take up a lot of space on your computer.


Exporting is when you take the video project and convert it into a full movie. If you don't get an option for MP4 under ""Save As,"" you'll likely need to export.

, You'll need to make an account. From their you can click on ""Upload"" to put your video up on the internet for all to see. Choose a good thumbnail of the song or band to help viewers find you, and be sure to name the song and artist in the title.


Youtube has strict copyright laws, and if you are not the rights owner of a song, there is a chance that your video will be taken down. You do, however, have a few strikes before losing YouTube privileges.

You can choose to use your real name if you'd like, or you can make up a good one. But choose wisely as you won't be able to change it later on.
, You don't want it to be like any other channel so be creative and make a totally new one that nobody but yourself could think of. Try and involve what you're doing into the name, such as Johns Artistic Channel - it's catchy, to the point and tells you what he will be doing on his channel. By adding aesthetic to the art in the name it gives you the vision of a cool and fun person showing YOU how to draw things., Once you are logged in, you will see your name or username at the top of the left menu. Click this to access your user page.

, It's a necessary piece of your YouTube channel. Make sure it has something to do with your channel name to ensure it's not confused with someone else's that looks similar., This is an image that is seen at the top of your channel page. YouTube will show examples of how the image will be displayed on the website, a TV, or a mobile device.


Use artwork that will draw your viewer’s attention. The cover image will set your channel apart from the rest of the YouTube interface.
Include your channel’s name or a message in the channel art. This will help solidify your name in the viewer’s mind.
YouTube recommend your channel art file should be 2560 x 1440 pixels
Change your channel art regularly. Unless you want to set a brand image by keeping the same picture, consider regularly changing your channel art about what content you are releasing in your channel. For example, if you are doing comedy sketches, change the channel art so that it relates to your current set of sketches.
Catch the readers attention by adding a cool and new picture to your channel. However, the picture needs to be about the thing you're doing on the channel. You need to put a picture on but with what type of mood you want. If you love art and you're a newcomer to YouTube bring out the silly in your icon so people know you're fun and always are up for a laugh on your channel. If you're formal and want to show your art skills to the world pick a more sensible picture filled with artistic talent.
To make art without Photoshop, use Picmonkey or Pixlr.

, Add a brief description for your channel to let the viewer know what kind of content to expect. To adjust the channel description, click the About tab in the main channel window. From there click the “+ Channel description” button.


Use the description to include links to your other websites, or to update news about your channel. Discuss who appears in your videos and link other related channels.
Make sure your description makes sense, because it is publicly visible at all times. It should most likely be a brief description of you and your channel.

, Look at your description and the intended video content. Use this to determine the name.


For example: if your videos are about knitting beautiful hats, you could call it: Proudly Knitted; The Infinite Knitter; or Woolly Mountains. And so forth.

, If you add links to your social media from your channel, make sure you have created a separate account for each example, Facebook page, Twitter account, Instagram account. But remember, it's not always recommended to do this., The first step to adding content is deciding what you want to share with the world. People use YouTube for a huge variety of things, from watching music videos, laughing at comedy sketches, learning with tutorial videos, and much more. Think about what you can bring to audiences that they aren’t getting from anyone else.

, If your friends keep telling you that you’re funny, consider making comedy videos. If singing is your thing, upload some videos of you performing. The key is to create content that will keep your viewers coming back to see more.

, Reviews are a great way to gain viewers, especially if you are reviewing something that people will be searching for. People always want to see good reviews before making the decision to purchase a product or service. There are a variety of possible review topics, including:


New albums
The latest gadgets
TV and movies
Video games
Books
Restaurants and other food products
Businesses

, Constantly try to create more content for your viewers. Not only will a steady stream of content keep your audience glued to your channel, it will also help you improve your craft as you continue to develop your style.


Brush up on basic video-making techniques. If you’re talking into the camera, make sure that the camera is steady and that you are speaking clearly and at a good volume. You may have the funniest skit in the world, but nobody is going to watch it if they can’t hear or see you properly.
If you are making a YouTube video for a gaming channel, you will need a recording software. There are many recording software out there, Bandicam being one of the most popular.
With the Bandicam free trial, you can make videos up to ten minutes for free!

, Cut out unneeded parts of the video, and add music to keep the viewer on your video. A well-edited video will make a much stronger impression on viewers than a hastily thrown together creation. Spend some time learning the ins and outs of your video editing software. Look up tutorials on how to perform basic editing functions.


There are a variety of free and open source video editors available online. Many of these contain the same features or similar features as expensive professional editing software. For beginners, feel free to get acquainted with the free software that comes with your computer. For Macs, iMovie and for Windows, it's the Windows Movie Maker. After you become acquainted with these interfaces and the technology behind them, you can progress to more complicated and more powerful software.
If you use music, it will have to be Non-copyright music, or music with permission of the maker.

, Most viewers will determine a video’s worth in the first few seconds. Strive to make your intros both entertaining and informative. The longer viewers watch your video, the higher YouTube will rank your videos on search results.


Show a teaser of clips from the video that the viewer is about to watch.
Make sure that your personality is front and center from the start of the video. Talk directly to the audience. Introduce the video personally, quickly discussing what to expect (don’t give away your twist if you have one!).
If you’ve built a brand, such as your name or a series that you are creating, make sure that is distinct and professional looking at the start of your video.
When making a nonfiction video, such as a review or tutorial, make sure that the purpose of the video is clear at the very beginning. This will keep viewers from looking for another, more informative video.

, The media constantly creates hype around events throughout the year, in virtually every field of interest. These are referred to as “Tent-pole” events. Examine your programming and determine which events are tent-pole events for your audience.


Create videos leading up to the event to capitalize on pre-event searches. As anticipation grows for an event, more and more people will be searching for related content.
Create videos during the event to cover it as it is happening. This is great for viewers that can’t otherwise experience the event themselves.
Create follow-up videos after the event. Use this time to summarize what happened and analyze any information.
Interact with your viewers throughout the process to keep them coming back to your channel.
During big events, increase the amount of content you release to continue capitalizing on new viewers. More content shows viewers that you are knowledgeable and passionate about the event.

, Every video, fiction or nonfiction, essentially needs to tell a story. There should be a definitive beginning, middle, and ending. This is as true for comedy sketches as it is for a tutorial on taking care of flowers.


Break up long videos into segments that focus on different aspects of the larger issue that the video is addressing. This will make the content more digestible for the viewer.

, These are boxes of text that appear in your video stream. Use them to direct viewers to other videos, channels, external websites and more.


You can use annotations to easily allow viewers to subscribe to your channel.
Use annotations on old videos to link to updated content.
Annotations can act as a “table of contents” for long videos, allowing you to link to specific times in the video.

, If you have made a name for yourself making skits, spend an episode talking directly with the audience, answering popular questions from the comments and discussing the process of your creativity. This behind-the-scenes look will create a stronger bond with your audience and make them feel like they have an impact on your work.

, Although it's great to post every hour, not everyone is that enticed to post that often. You may want to upload a new video daily or every other day., But if you can't afford those, you can try Bandicam, until you have earned enough capital., Log in to YouTube and click the Videos tab in your User page. From here, click the “+ Upload a video” button to start uploading your content. Click the “Select files to upload” button to browse for video files, or drag them into the window. YouTube will begin converting and uploading the video.


If you want to control who watches the video, click the Privacy drop-down menu and select Private. You can then add the YouTube usernames or email addresses of the people who you want to be able to view the file. You can send up to 50 private invitations per video.
If you want to upload videos that are longer than 15 minutes, you will need to verify your account with Google.

, You can't upload something if you can't give it a name! The titles of your videos are the trigger to earning views, likes, comments, and even subscriptions at times., Tagging your videos will help make it show up when viewers search for content. Make sure that your tags apply to your video, but also make sure that you aren’t using the same tags as everyone else in your genre.


Try to narrow down your appeal to a few keywords when coming up with tags. For example, instead of tagging your video as “singing”, narrow it down to the style: “blues singing”, “country singing”, “freestyle rapping”, etc.
You can tag videos any way that you think people will search for it. Your tags should thoroughly describe the content of your video.
Use a mixture of broad and specific tags. For example, if you are making a short comedy film about ninjas, use the tags “short film”, “ninjas”, “funny”, “martial arts”, “action”, “fighting”, “silly”, etc.
You can use tags to create “sets” of videos. Create a unique tag and then apply it to each video that you want to keep together. This will lead to more clicks through to your related videos.

, When recording, make sure you keep a schedule of what day you need to record so that you don't pressure yourself with recording every day., If you want to have a successful channel, you will need a steady stream of content. Try to update your channel every couple of weeks. Let your viewers know if you are going to be taking an extended break, and when you’ll be back.


Setting a consistent release schedule can help build a following. Think of it like a TV show; everyone looks forward to a new episode of their favorite show, and they know exactly when it will be coming. Try to update weekly or every other week.

, Try to respond to comments when you have time. This will create a stronger bond between you and your viewers. Viewers that feel that the content creator cares about them will be more inclined to return and watch more content, as well as tell others about it.


Spend a few hours after uploading a video responding to the comments that viewers make about it. These viewers are your most die-hard fans because they are the ones eagerly anticipating the release of new content and are brave enough to comment on it. Treat them with respect, and you will see their numbers grow.
Moderate the comments on your page as much as possible. While reading nasty comments can be funny, they detract from your channel and drive viewers away. Remove comments that would offend others and report abusive users. This will help create a friendlier environment for your regular viewers.
Pose questions to your viewers. Try to keep the questions simple, such as Yes/No questions or “Voting” questions. This will keep negative feedback down and promote good discussion amongst your viewers.

, If you have older content that your newer viewers probably haven’t seen, stick it in your feed so that everyone sees it on the front of your channel page. This can give your old videos some increased traffic.

, You should be spending as much time on possible logged into YouTube, even when you’re not actively maintaining your channel. You should be watching other’s videos, interacting with other users, and browsing for like-minded content.


Link to other user’s content that you feel complements your own. This will help your channel show up on searches as related viewing.
Try to maintain a schedule for adding other links to other videos. Curate your linked and liked videos on days that you are not uploading your own videos. This will help break up the wait between your videos, keeping your viewers active on your channel.
When liking other videos, make sure that they are videos that you feel will appeal to the widest audience of your viewers as possible. You don’t want to turn away your audience because no one likes the video you liked.

, Once you upload something, there's a bit of a chance that your video will get views, and sometimes people like to leave their thoughts about the video you uploaded down in the comments section. So, it's a good idea to always keep check of your videos., Try to incorporate viewer commentary and creations into your videos. Post submission guidelines such as requiring a subscription to your channel.

, Forge relationships with other creators in the same field as yourself. Cross-promote each other’s channels to boost viewership. Do guest spots on another person’s videos, and invite others to guest start in yours.


Make sure that your viewers can easily reach the channels that you are collaborating with. You want them to be spending their time delving into the content that your community has created.

, Link videos and playlists from your channels into Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and other social media outlets. Encourage your friends, both online and offline, to pass your links on to others.


Avoid spamming your social media networks with links to your channels. A friendly reminder now and then is good, but almost no one reacts positively to being hammered with links.

, Don’t force it down their throats, but suggest that viewers share your videos if they like them. These messages are best saved for the end of the video after the important content has been viewed. Remind your viewers to “like” your videos.

, That's bad. If you somehow feel that when you're popular enough and people are re-uploading your content, search on YouTube the name of your videos to see if someone re-uploaded them without your consent., If you found your videos in someone else's channel, warn them. No need for conflict, unless they don't stop doing that then you can report them to YouTube."

Learn how to play an instrument or sing, if that's your interest.,
Learn the basics of recording and, if it's a Music VIDEO, basics of video editing.,
Get necessary equipment.,
Electric Guitar/Bass: Guitar/Bass.,
Acoustic Drums: For this, the easiest and cheapest way to record is using a Condenser Microphone that captures all drums at the same time in the same signal.,
Electronic Drums: This can be pretty easy to record.,
Vocals: This can be pretty tricky.,
Look for Musicians.,
Once you've found a good musician, ask him POLITELY to make a collaboration project.,
Start recording.,
In case everyone's using the same recording software, pick one of you, or it could even be another person not playing the instrument, to edit audio.,
If you're planning to make it a video, you'll all need a camera each, and at least one of you has to have a Video Editor Software (A good one).,
Upload the video.,
After you upload the video, don't forget to mention the other musician(s) in your video description and in your tags.",How to Make a YouTube Collaboration Music Video," If you play guitar, you obviously need a guitar. Depending on your style, and whether it's an electric or acoustic guitar, you will need different type of equipment. If play drums, TRY to get an electronic drum set. Much easier to record. Bass usually has the same requirements as the guitar. If you want to sing, MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO SING. YouTubers are not that nice with critics and reviews.;
, Learn how to record your instrument/voice. What equipment you need, the time it should take, place where to record, etc. Once you are really sure and you've got some money to spend on it, continue to the next step.

, These are some examples for each Rock traditional instrument. NOTE: You WILL need an Audio Recording Software or equipment for all of these, and it's better if it's a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), that way you get Equalizers, Amp/Effects simulators, etc. If it's a video, you will also need a camera and a Video Editing software.


Acoustic Guitar/Acoustic Bass: Guitar/Bass, Microphone and Microphone stand (You can look recording techniques in Internet), Audio Interface (Unless your microphone can connect directly into your computer, like USB or 1/8 inch Microphones).

, There are many ways to record these, so these are what you need for each one. Direct Recording is connecting your guitar directly into your computer, without changing its signal before it enters the computer: Cables, Computer Audio Interface, and a DAW with an Amp simulator. Semi-direct Recording is a rarely used type of recording, and is done by connecting your guitar/bass to your amp, and connecting the headphone/line out output to a Recording Interface, a Computer Sound Card, or a Recorder. For this you will need: Amp, Cables (At least two), Recording Interface/Recorder (Unless you connect it directly to your computer Sound Card, which is not recommended). The last one is Miking Recording. As said by the name, it means using a microphone to catch your amp's signal, and sending the microphone signal to your recording equipment. For this you will need: Amp, Cables (Instrument and probably also Mic, or XLR, cables), a Microphone, Microphone stand, Audio interface or Recorder.


Acoustic/Electric Guitar/Bass: All of both Electric and Acoustic Recording techniques will work.

, Then you just record it with your audio interface, recorder, or computer. Another better, but more expensive way, is using specialty microphones. This is a method that includes several microphones, each one used for different purposes, such as a bass drum mic, a snare mic, a high and mid tom mic, etc. This offers greater definition in each drum. These types of microphones can be bought in sets of 4-piece, 5-pieces or so on drum sets. However, this method can be expensive. You must buy the mics, cables, and an interface with a lot of inputs, or a mixer with a lot of inputs that connects to the interface.

, It is almost certain that the Electronic Drum Set has a line output, so you just connect it to a Line input in your interface or recorder, and you're all set.


Keyboards/Piano: If you use an electronic keyboard, which is very common, it probably has a Line Output, so you just connect it to the line input in your recorder or interface, and you're set. If you use an acoustic, or Grand Piano, you will have to use one or two microphones. You can look for techniques in Recording Piano on the Internet.

, To record Vocals in a Studio or near-studio quality, you will need a Vocal Condenser microphone. This are much more sensible and will capture nicely your voice. Condenser microphones, however, need electric signal to work. This signal is also called ""Phantom Power"". Some interfaces have a Phantom Power applier already built in, but if it doesn't, you'll have to get one for the mics to work. Also, to provide a better vocal recording, you should get a shock mount and a pop filter. You can look up on the Internet what those are for. You can also use a dynamic microphone, which are mostly used for live performances, since they are less sensitive and don't use Phantom Power. You will also need a really quiet place, with good acoustics. On the internet or in Recording books they tell which acoustics are best for recording vocals.




Once you have learned how to record your instrument or voice, it's time to look for Musicians on Youtube.



, You can look for musicians all over YouTube. There are thousands of them. You can also tell someone you know to make a collaboration. To look for them, look for a cover of the song you would like to play, or a cover of a song by that same artist. This is to get better probabilities that they will like, know, and want to play the song. If you want to make an original song video, think it very hard, because you could probably be giving them rights to the song. If you are sure of your decision, then look for a musician with a similar style to yours. Also try someone with a number of subscribers and views as you. This will increase the probability that they will accept. Remember that a collaboration doesn't necessarily mean to cover all the parts of a song. It could be a two guitar collaboration, a guitar, bass and drum lineup, or a whole virtual band.

, If they want another song other than yours, then try doing both, or settle for one. If he says no, then accept it and look for someone else, and asks if they know someone that might like to do it. If they say yes, tell them to look for the musicians missing.

, To do this, there are various way. This could be the traditional multi-track recording. This means that, first, the drummer will record him/herself. USE A METRONOME. It's essential, specially for the drummer. Then comes the bass guitar, which will record him/herself over the drum track previously recorded. After that, the guitar(s) will record themselves. As with multi-track recording, first rhythm, then lead guitars, and at last the guitar fills. Then comes the keyboards. Since both guitars and keyboards are often used as melodic and rhythmic, they are at the same level in the order of recording, so either could be first. At last, and at the very last, come the vocals. This is because vocals are completely melodic, and they have to follow rhythm over all, so everything must be set into place before vocals.

, This means mixing, equalizing, leveling, etc. ALL the recordings, so that it sounds like you want it to sound. In case you all have different software, the Audio Editor must get each recorded track every time one is made. He/She must get it in an Audio form. That way, he/she can put it on the software easily, and it can still be edited and leveled. Like this: He gets the drum track, he mixes, levels, etc., and sends it to the bass player. He/She records the bass track with the drum track as a backing track in his/her own recording program. This type of situation is one of the reasons why you SHOULD use a metronome. The drummer can use a metronome track, and another drum track. You use the audio file with the metronome as a backing track on every recording, or until it's not required anymore. At the end, the drummer sends the audio file with ONLY the drum track, and substitute it for the one with the metronome in the Editor's software. So it's also important not to cut the drum track, so that it's easier.

, It's as simple as this: You video-record yourself while recording, send it to the one that has the Video Editor Software. He/She makes a video showing everyone's video in an equitable way. That means using a ""Picture in Picture"" kind of thing. That person also has to get the final Audio Record, which will include everyone's tracks and the final mix. He/She will sync the videos with the Audio. This can take some time, so be patient. Also, use good cameras. Invest at least $100 on a good camera. This will also work as a normal camera, so it's worth it. To make yourself known with the others' channels, put the names, channels, and if you want even the country of the musicians collaborating. This will help get views by someone other than the ones that already know you. So you all should have the final video to upload it to your channels.

, Because it will be a lot of data in one single video (around 5 videos and around 5 audio tracks in one video), the upload to YouTube will take a lot of time. An option is to get up early one day, upload the video, and leave the computer on to let it upload the video, and then go to work/school/anything. Come back later and see the progress. If the upload is taking way too long, try changing it to a more suitable video and audio file (the best ones are: video, mp4, and avi, and audio file being mp3).

, This will increase your and their views.

Take a reference image.,
A recommendation would be to trace a base, and then draw over that.,
Decide what your parody is going to be.,
Colour them.,
Do the background.,
Upload it to the music.,
Sit back and be proud of your work!",How to Make a Trust Me Parody,";
, Do whatever suits you best.

, For instance, it could be 'Supernatural'. Plan who the characters represent well, and put them in those places. If you can't draw straight onto Photoshop, go back to basics and use sheets of A4, place them onto your computer screen (or go freehand!), and then scan them in.

, A recommendation would be to use Photoshop or Paint Tool SAI to colour - just something that you are comfortable using and that gives good cel-shading results. If you have a tablet, use it - if not, draw in the shadows using a hard sharp pencil before scanning.

, The background is often a gradient or block colour. Match the colour to the show. SPN would probably be a dark colour, or a light colour to a dark colour - whatever matches.

, A good program to use is Sony Vegas or After Effects.

, You worked had on this - it's gonna look great!

Make sure all of the plushies are the sizes that are the most natural. If your dragon is smaller than your frog, then you might need to get a smaller frog plush or a bigger dragon plush.;
, Use a video camera or an iOS device and get editing software for your computer. Windows Live Movie Maker is a good choice for simple videos, but you may need other programs for more complicated editing.


Don't shake the camera too much! This is a problem many beginners have.

, Which of you plushies do you want to use? Which ones will be the main characters? What are their personalities like? Do they get along, or do some of them love or hate each other? Answer questions like these to flesh out the characters for your series.

, While making it up as you go can be fun, you'll end up with plot holes and loose ends all over the place. Write down your ideas, sketch out the major storylines, and plan out the plot for each episode.


Make sure the plot is original! There are tons of ""Peach is kidnapped by Bowser"" and ""Sonic has to defeat Eggman"" videos. Why not a series about something different?

, Make sure your plot will be able to support as many episodes as you want to make. Each episode can attack one small part of the main plot, or each episode can be about something completely different. They can all use the same cast of characters, or each episode can focus on a different character.

, Make sure you have all the characters and props you'll need. You can even memorize the script to make filming easier, if you want.

, Find a place with good lighting and not too much background noise. This will help your videos look and sound as good as possible.

, Edit it to make sure it looks good, add music to fit the mood if you'd like, and then post it on your YouTube channel.


Make a playlist for your series so that all the episodes can be found in the same place.

, For each new episode, write a script before filming. Each should have a different plot and focus, but they should all fit cohesively into the series.


If you don't like the way a series is going, make a series finale. If you don't want anything to do with a series anymore, than just announce the cancellation of the series.

, You shouldn't be stressed when making an episode. Take a break if you aren't in the mood to make plush videos.

Post the video on YouTube.",How to Make a YouTube Vampire Show," Usually TV shows have one big plot in each season that keeps you coming back, while some episodes of that show have different plots. Will your character deal with being a new vampire while hiding it from their friends? Or is he or she trying to fight off vampire hunters while on the run? The overall plot can be more complex than this.


Write down your ideas. You don't want to forget them!;
, For example, is it really possible to ride on a unicorn? Does this plot fit the effect your show wants to have? It's okay if you want to keep certain ideas to use in just one episode, or in the next season.

, YouTube shows usually have about 8-12 episodes per season, but shows on TV usually have about 20-30.


Make sure the season finale and first episode are some of the most interesting of the season, the first episode is what will give the viewers their very first opinion of the show, and the final episode is something they've been waiting for a long time, make it special! Audio and video quality and acting also counts, but we'll get to that soon.

, Now that you've got the idea for the episodes and plot, make a name that describes the feel and plot of your show. For example, Vampalicious could be used for a cheerleader who becomes a vampire or Midnight Shadows could be about a vampire hunter who got the wrong impression trying to take down your character who's a vampire.

, You'll need this later for casting.

, Where will you film? Will your video be interrupted by other background noises? Figure out where you will film later for each scene, and make sure you have permission to film where you want to.

, Some parents might not want their child's face being visible on YouTube to creepers and drama llamas who love fights in the comments section.


If you can't film your face, try filming your toys instead. A lot of people like to use LPS or Webkinz instead of using their faces, and using toys makes more things possible, but using toys for each character makes the show aimed more toward the younger audience out there.

, Choose people who are good actors, so even if your BFF from kindergarten is begging you to get a part, you may have to let her/him down easy. But then again, you should be familiar with the people you want to be in it and shouldn't be pulling random people off the street. Make sure people you want to cast have their parents permission to be in your show.

, It doesn't have to be anything fancy, you can use your cell phone or maybe a webcam on a laptop until you can get a better camera.

, Try to get everyone's feedback on different episode plots. After all, that girl who can't even do a cartwheel may not want to jump onto a dumpster from the roof and then use a closet hanger to slide down an electrical wire (actually, unless this is the next James Bond movie, you shouldn't be doing this at all).


Make sure to get everyone's advice. You don't have to use it, but they might point out things you didn't notice, like, ""Where are we going to find a beach? We live in Colorado."" Answer: Green screen magic.

, Yes, this may be a bore, but it'll help in the long run. When you film your episode, you don't have to do exactly what the script says, but don't go riding on a unicorn when it says you teleport to where you need to go. Too much improvising can change the entire plot.

, Make sure your parents are okay with ten kids screaming and wrestling in your backyard for a battle scene. If you can't go anywhere you need to, you can use a green screen.


Note: Don't wear any green at all while acting in front of the green screen. Later when the green is edited out and the background is edited in, you'll be a floating head if you wear a green shirt!

, Before you start filming, collect any props you will need and practice the scene a few times to get a hang of it and make sure nobody laughs when the film starts rolling. Not everyone is perfect, so don't expect to get it on the first try.

, How would you look if you found out your boyfriend is a werewolf? Probably surprised, in disbelief, maybe fainting. Act as best as you can, and don't try to sound like a robot.

, Like for example, fighting in Ikea and screaming is going to be interesting, but you will be kicked out before you finish filming. You could even get arrested!

, If you just finished filming the season finale, then maybe a little cast party or outing at the amusement park can be in line. It's okay if you don't finish filming on your first session; Rome wasn't exactly built in a day. Schedule another time for filming.

, Something like Windows Movie Maker or IMovie. There should be other articles on wikiHow on how to edit videos, so if you're new to video-editing you can learn how to edit from those. If you filmed on your smartphone, don't worry, there's a ton of apps like VideoStar to help you edit.

, Don't forget to add in your sound effects, a good place to get them is freesound.org. If you can, see how others may think of your episode before you post it on YouTube. Maybe you didn't notice that the theme song is in the wrong spot?

, Invite your cast over for a premiere party! Don't be afraid to get dressed up, even if the first episode is only five minutes long, it'll be a moment that'll last forever in your memories.

Before you want to tape yourself/something else, you will want to have a good idea. Something that people will actually look at.
Think about what the consumer wants; maybe making fun of something that happened the other day, or maybe you caught something truly amazing on tape, like an earthquake or something, or you can just inform people about a disease. The possibilities list is endless.;
, Make sure your voice isn't drowning out the subject's if you aren't self-video recording.


If you didn't shoot the footage yet, buy a video camera and work your concept you thought of before, out. If you already have the footage, Go to step 4, if not, get your camera. Read the manual, or if you already understand it, go and video tape your idea. When you are shooting the footage, make sure you are not shooting against light etc. Make sure you have enough lighting to capture clear images.
As soon as you have your footage, connect your camera with a computer, and open the tape in a program for movie editing; Windows Movie Maker is a good example for that, it's free and its on any Windows PC (if it's a legal copy), if you have Mac, there's plenty of other fish (free software) in the sea. Again, read the readme, implemented with your software package. If you want/need to adjust anything. Do it now.

, There is a 15-minute length limit for all videos.

, Windows Movie Maker is a free program that you can easily find on your computer if you have Windows. It is very similar to the video editing program in YouTube. However, you will edit your video on your computer, and then upload it to YouTube.The MAC equivalent of Movie Maker is iMovie. You could buy a professional video editing program instead. Some choices include Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro. But these can be costly.
If you have Windows on your PC, you should be able to find Windows Movie Maker under your start menu. Transfer your video from your phone or camcorder to your computer using a USB cord. Then, run Movie Maker.

, This is a relatively straight-forward process that is very similar to the YouTube video editing program. You will also place videos into a timeline so that you can edit them and add enhancements.


Choose “capture from video device” in the left hand bar. You will select a name for your video and where you want to store the footage on your computer. Choose best quality playback on computer when the next screen pops up.

Use the controls to rewind or fast forward the video to the place in the video you want to capture. Click “start capture.” When you have the footage captured, click “stop capture” and then “finish.”
This will break the footage into clips. Choose as many clips as you want with this process, and drag them into the timeline. , Next, you will want to edit your video into smaller segments or remove pieces of the video that you don’t like. For example, maybe a piece of your video is shaky, and you want to get rid of it by editing it out.


Choose a video. Click on “show storyboard” and click on the clip. It will appear in the media player. When you press play, you will see a small button on the bottom right of the screen that is the editing button.
Press that button when you want to remove a piece of the clip. This will split the footage into two pieces. Delete the piece in the middle that you don’t want by selecting right click and delete.

, Sometimes you want to improve the quality of your video by brightening it or adding filters or other special effects. This can be done pretty easily in Movie Maker.


To improve the video’s quality, click on the video and then right click. When a menu pops up, choose video effects. You will find many options for enhancing your clip, such as the ability to decrease brightness or add other tones. Select what you want and save it.
If you want to increase or decrease the volume of audio, click on the clip and then press audio button on the far left. Increase or decrease, and save.
To enter credits, go to storyboard view and click on a clip. Choose tools in the top menu and then “titles and credits.” Choose where you want to add a title. Type the title in the box that appears.

A YouTube account is the same as a Google account, and creating a YouTube account will grant you access to other Google products, such as Gmail and Drive.


Create your account or use your existing one. Add keywords to help people find your channel. You can add keywords by navigating to the Advanced section of your Channel Settings. Make sure that your keywords are relevant to your content.
Your user name can also work for or against you. If it’s short, easy to remember, and original, people will be more apt to remember you. However if you are using an existing account, you can always change your username by editing it on your Google+ account.;
, Try to upload content that is high quality, and isn't super long. (This option can vary depending on what type of content you decide to upload) Also try to upload regularly and stay consistent with your uploads.


Even if your content isn't great at first, keep at it. Practice makes perfect. Try to make each video better than the last. You will often learn as you go.
Improve your content by either using a better camera or trying better editing software or techniques. Also try to improve the way things are filmed. Use a tripod, have a friend help you or light your scenes better. It all helps for a better end product which in turn helps you get a better audience.
By uploading regularly you can help hold an audience. People are more likely to subscribe if you add content on regular schedule, and maintain that schedule as much as possible.
Make sure to tag your videos with key words that describe the content, as well as an eye-catching description. These will help drive people to your video from YouTube searches.

, Building an audience is key to increasing your monetization. You need people to watch your ads in order to make any money off of them. There is no one secret to getting more subscribers, just make the best content that you can and they will come to you.


Keep uploading content and try to get people hooked. Send your video out on Twitter and Facebook. Share it with people. Distribute it elsewhere on the internet. Subscribers are essential to becoming a partner.
Interact with your viewers by responding to comments and making occasional videos directly related to viewer comments and questions. Connecting with your community will bring more members into that community.

, In order to start earning money on your videos, you’ll need to enable monetization. This means you are allowing YouTube to place ads in your video. This also means that you acknowledge that there is no copyrighted material in your video.

Go to www.youtube.com and click ""My Channel"" on the webpage.
Click the link called ""Video Manager"" on the top bar.
Click channel and Enable on monetization.

,


You can monetize a video as it uploads by clicking the Monetization tab and checking the “Monetize with Ads” box.
To monetize a video after it has been uploaded, open your Video Manager and click the “$” sign next to the video that you want to monetize. Check the “Monetize with Ads” box.

, You can set up Google AdSense for free at the AdSense website. Click the Sign Up Now button to begin creating your account. You must be 18 years or older to create your own account. If you are younger than that, you will need an adult to help you.


You need either PayPal or a bank account and a valid mailing address as well as other information so AdSense can verify who you are and who to send the money to. You only gain money per ad click and a smaller amount per view but it adds up over time. This is why having an audience is key.

, Once you have some videos online, monetized, and being viewed, you can check out the analytics on them to see how they are performing. Click the Analytics option in your Channel menu. Here you can view estimated earnings, ad performance, video views, demographics and more.


Use these tools to see how your content is resonating with your audience. You can change your content or your marketing if you’re finding that you aren’t attracting the users that you want to.

, Don't put your videos just on YouTube! Start a blog, make a website or post them on other video or social media sites. The more views it gets, the better. By sharing the link or embedding the video on the internet, you are increasing the chance of it getting noticed.

, YouTube Partners are YouTube members who have monetized videos with a large number of viewers. Partners gain access to more content creation tools, and can win prizes for the number of viewers they have. Partners also get access to much more community support and tips.


You can apply for YouTube partnership at any time through the YouTube Partner page. In order to gain access to the most powerful Partner programs, you need to have 15,000 cumulative watch hours for your channel over the last 90 days.

, Supp.me allows to easily create polls & quizzes for free. Just create a question for your subscribers and invite them to answer it.

, If you only want to embed the second half of a video, you can set it to start at any point you want when a viewer clicks on the video. Simply add ""#t="" followed by the minutes and seconds, right after the YouTube Link. If I want to start a video 1 minute, 12 seconds in, I would add ""#t=1m12s.""



Example: <iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https:</iframe>, This means the video will start as soon as someone opens your page or website. Add the phrase ""&autoplay==1"" right after the video ID, which is the string of numbers and letters after ""https://www.youtube.com/embed/."" or ""https://www.youtube.com/v/.""


This may occur twice in the embed code, so make sure you add it twice.

It's recommended that you pick a game you’re good at and love playing, as your enthusiasm will show through.
Avoid games that are used frequently for LP’s, like Minecraft, Super Mario 64, or Slender. An over-saturated audience is a bored audience. You also run the risk, which gets higher the more well-known the game, of your LP video getting lost in the mix.
Avoid repetitive games.;
, For recording PC games, you’ll want to get a video capture program. A few examples are listed below.



Free Downloads: D3DGear and Fraps (free version only records for limited time and uses a watermark on the video). Macs come built in with Quicktime Player, so that's cool.
If you want better production values and features, consider purchasing something like Camtasia.
On most of the operating systems utilising X Window System (e.g. Linux based systems, BSD software distributions, possibly Macs) you can use ffmpeg with vcodec x11grab to capture part of your desktop. It can get pretty technical, though, since ffmpeg is operated via a terminal.
To capture footage from a video game console, you’ll need a capture card, a video card with video inputs, a DVD recorder, a FireWire/USB converter, or a camcorder with AV inputs that you can connect directly to the console.

, To record the best audio, use an audio editor like Audacity and a decent microphone. Don’t talk with your mouth too close to the microphone. Your voice will sound muffled or distorted.

'Live-commentary' (creating commentary while playing the game) is difficult - especially if doing a 'blind' run. If your commentary is not confident or easily turns to dead air, consider 'Post-commentary' (recording the game footage, performing editing and then adding the commentary) instead. Note that post-commentary can also be in a text form.

,


Greet the viewer, tell them your screen-name, and give a brief summary of what is going to happen in the video.
Giving a brief recap of what happened in the last video can also be included.
Keep the introduction short.

, Make the videos funny. The best way of doing this is live commentary, but try not to fake laugh. Maybe you fall down a pit by accident, and laugh for a few seconds. You can also make fun of yourself or your other videos.

, Don’t simply recite what is happening on the screen but still pay attention to the game itself. Also do not go long periods without talking.

, If you’re having fun, chances are your audience will have fun as well., Pick an appropriate place to end the video; do not end in the middle of a cut-scene or fight. Give a quick summary of what is going to happen in the next video.

,



Windows Movie Maker (for Windows PC) or iMovie (for Mac) provide some basic features, but getting a more extensive video editing program is recommended.
Cut out excessive mistakes or deaths.
Make sure your commentary is in sync with the video.
Watch the video through after editing to make sure there are no problems.

, Websites like YouTube, blip.tv, Veoh, and Dailymotion are great places to upload your videos. You can also upload your videos to your website or blog.


Watch the video after uploading to make sure everything uploaded correctly. If not, re-upload the video or re-encode, if necessary.
Take pride in the quality of your work. Never upload or keep a video that has obvious problems.
Consider using a program to compress your video, like x264, DivX, MediaCoder, AVISynth, etc. If done right, there is little impact to video quality and it reduces file size, upload time, and space used on your hard drive.

, Link them to your blog or website or any source of potential fans. This is one of the best ways to get tons of views quickly.

,


Posting your video to a Let’s Play community allows you to get helpful feedback.
You can learn new and useful information from message boards and other players.

, There's a fair chance they will advertise you and their viewers will become your own. Don't use them, though, that won't go down well in the YouTube community.


Don't let haters win. Every Let's player has at least one hater who just wants to annoy them. If you stop making videos, they win. You'll have more fans than haters, so don't let them get you down.

The next steps depend on what you will be using to record your movie.

",How to Create Your Own YouTube Video1," It doesn't have to be anything special, but it has to be cool and interesting enough to intrigue YouTube viewers. Ask yourself the following questions and write the answers.


How long will my video be? YouTube limits video length to 15 minutes. If you want your video longer than 15 minutes, post it in another video. (ex: Part One, Part Two, etc.).
What environment will my video be in? You may have to change the settings on your camera.
Is the topic I am recording interesting? Would anyone watch? If the beginning of your video is boring, viewers won't waste time watching the rest of it. Don't make a video only you are interested in, unless you're uploading it just for fun.

, You don't want to be in the middle of making a video when you realize something is not in place!


If you're narrating, speak in a loud, clear voice so viewers can hear you. Drink water before you start recording. Keep a bottle of water within reach and don't drink noisily while recording!

As for more details about how to customize your video: experiment.",How to Create Lyric Videos for YouTube Using Windows Movie Maker," If you have an old one, keep it. If you want, you can make a new account that only makes lyric videos. The username for your new lyric-video-making account should be something like TheLyricerz, TheAwesomeLyrics, or LyricCity. Create a username that's funky and cool. Don't copy others. Also, remember that you can't take a username that has already been taken; you will be asked to put another username.;
, All the lyrics will go there. However, make sure you aren't committing copyright infringement by doing this!

, That's where you'll make the lyric video.

, Find your song and click ""Import"".
For the newest version of Windows Movie Maker, however, you will need to add a title page or picture /before/ adding a song. To do this, simply click the ""Add photo or video"" button or the ""Title"" button on the ribbon along the top of the screen, select the desired image, if you so choose, and click ""Open"" to import it.

,
Your picture should be at the beginning already unless you imported the picture before adding a title. To switch the positions, simply click and drag the image you would like to change the location of and place the blue line (the indication of where the image or video will go) to the desired location.

, Click the ""Pictures"" button, find the picture that you chose, and click the button that says ""Import"".
For those of you using the newer version of Windows Movie Maker, however, you have already imported your picture or video. For this step, you will instead click on the ""Add Music"" button which is also in the ribbon along the top of the screen next to the ""Add Picture or Video"" button, usually to the right. After that, you simply select your song and click the ""open"" button to import the song to the video.

,
Again, for those of you who have already adjusted the placement of the pictures and videos, you will instead need to adjust the placement of the song. Since there is no longer a timeline with the music on the bottom, the music imported simply begins wherever you are in the video when you import it. To adjust the song placement, there are two methods.
A: You may do as you have done with the pictures by clicking and dragging the music to wherever you would like it to start. You can drag the song so that it begins at the beginning or ending of a certain slide, or you may drag the song such that it begins somewhere within a frame, or
B: You may see that there is a button along the top ribbon which contains an option of song properties. Click this tab. Within this tab, on the ribbon at the top of the screen, there will be an option to manually input the start and end time for the song, down to the nearest hundredth of a second. You can use the arrows to increase or decrease the starting and ending time, or you may type in into the box.

,
For the users of the newer versions, on the home tab within the ribbon, there are buttons to add a title page or to add a credits page. Either option will work, though many people find the credits option to work better. From here, you may approach this in numerous manners. First, you may type all of your lyrics into this one text box. This, however, is not recommended as there is a great likelihood that the pace of the words will not keep up with the song. Another option is to add one screen's worth of credits for each verse or so. Later, there will be more detail about how to adjust this.

, Make sure all the lyrics are accurate.

, Create them for many songs, even the ones you don't like.

,


Create your own website. In your website, post all of your lyric videos and the other songs you are going to do in the future.
Open Facebook, Myspace and Twitter Accounts. Let your fans know what you are doing.

, There are many tabs that allow you to adjust your video to your own tastes and make it more of your video. There are ways to adjust font, text color, text size, background color, lyric effects, lyric animations (how the words come on or off of the screen), picture transitions, picture effects, the very specific timing of the lyrics, how long each phrase or verse will last, among many other things. Don't forget to save often!

Gamers? Locksmiths? You can easily do an Internet search to investigate these topics for video ideas, or you could:


Conduct an interview.
Record your opinions about your genre.
Make predictions about fan tastes.;
, Fans are frequently vocal about their wants and opinions. Some fan-fiction has even seen commercial success.Use your knowledge of your fan-base, or the fan-base you would like to have, to better direct your creative energies., A lot of social media is integrated, making reaching out to your fans even easier. Ask people what they'd like to see, or poll the audience to get some opinions about a question that's been on your mind.

, Fans will often rave about their favorite parts of a video, which you can use to your advantage. Can you implement the same technique? How about making a video addressing comments?

, Whatever your channel, there's bound to be some forums out there about your topic. Which forums are the most active and what are the topics of conversation? Is there anything your fans are itching to see? Maybe that can be your next video!

, This can be anything from your local Cherry Festival to the closing of a historic local building. You can splice this footage into your videos, or add an ominous soundtrack to give the story a different spin.


Theme parties are a great place for footage and inspiration. Seeing your friends dressed up as interesting characters might inspire a character of your own.

, Find some craft specialty items that you can review or comment on in your YouTube videos. Maybe you can recreate the item, and make a how-to video about what you learned.

, You can always send a message to a YouTuber you admire, asking if they would like to collaborate with you on a project. A script idea that's been floating around in your head might turn into a neat video performed by you and your friends.

, Some proxy sites, such as ProxFree, will allow you to select which server you want to connect to. Select a server located in the country that has access to the video. For example, if the video is only available in the United Kingdom, select the UK server.


This may take some trial and error if you don't know where the video originated from. You may have to try different servers until you find one that works for the video you want to watch.

, Enter ""youtube.com"" into the URL field on the YouTube proxy site. This will load the YouTube page through the proxy site. You'll likely see a bar at the top of the screen for the proxy site you are using. The YouTube page will load in whatever language is native to the server's location.

, You can use the search function in YouTube to find the video, or if you have the video's URL you can just paste it into your proxy site's URL field. If the server you are connected to is able to view the video, you will be able to watch it.

, Remember, you'll need to connect to a location that is able to view the video. Your best bet is to connect to a server in the same location that the video was uploaded from. You may have to try several different servers until you find one that works.


Not all YouTube proxy sites allow to select the server you want to connect to. Search ""YouTube proxy"" using your favorite search engine to find more YouTube proxy sites.
Avoid logging in to YouTube while using a proxy site, as you'll be sending your login information through the proxy service on its way to YouTube. It could be intercepted by an untrustworthy proxy.

Load this altered URL in the proxy and you will bypass the age verification system. This will allow you to watch the video you need to watch without having to compromise your login information through the proxy."

Buy Instagram followers.,
Follow other users and complement them.,
Run a contest.",How to Buy YouTube Comments," These could include your email list, newsletters, your Facebook or Twitter account, website and signage. Explain to your audience what Instagram is and then encourage them to follow you. Linking your Instagram account to various social networks gives you a great opportunity to promote your photos and get more people to follow you.;
, In order to get Instagram followers, you should upload the best photos you have because they are more likely to attract followers. As you do this, make sure that you do not upload too many of them since people may miss them. It is advisable to upload only three to four photos at a time.

, Note that even though you have great photos to share, you may lose track of the content in your account and it may grow stale. If you do not manage your Instagram account properly, you can hurt the overall message of your brand. You can assign someone who is experienced in community management or someone who understands photography to help you manage your account.

, Such hashtags will help you attract users who are searching for various types of photos or subjects. For example, if you take a photo of the golden gate bridge, include #San Francisco or #Golden Gate Bridge in the description so that users who are searching for photos taken in San Francisco will easily find your picture. You should also search for hashtags that are related to your brand such as #design, #fashion and #beauty.

, When you post photos that are geotagged, Instagram also brings up other photos taken at the same location. In this way, Instagram users who are posting photos from your location may see your photos and follow them to your profile.

, This is another great way to get followers and there are many benefits of doing this. One benefit of buying Instagram followers is that you can expose your services and products better. You will also be able to gain real followers who will help your business flourish. Buying Instagram followers is much cheaper than other methods of advertising such as using billboards, television commercials and print media. When you buy Instagram followers, you will increase your business's popularity and increase your profits.

, You can increase your Instagram followers by spreading goodwill feelings. Make sure that you follow them sincerely since this will increase the chances that other users will follow you back.

, You can run a competition or contest that allows Instagram users to win prizes when they follow you. Make sure that you come up with a well thought out plan as to how you will select and contact winners.

Focus your video content to what is popular.",How to Become Popular on YouTube," Do you upload music videos? Do you make funny videos? Are you going to do tutorials? Are you a stand-up comedian? Do you tell stories? Choose whichever one you like to do. It can just be a mix up of everything also.


One way is to get inspired by others. Watch the funniest videos on YouTube. Then think about ways to mix them up, making parodies or remixes. Choose anything you basically love to watch, taking note of what your friends find funny too.;
, If you know some dance moves, sing well, can tell a great tale, etc., keep practicing your art to become even better at it. When you feel ready, think about making videos of you showing your friends how to do whatever it is you're excellent at. For example, if it's dance, make a movie about the moves, or create a video dance that is brand new (it might turn into a popular dance if it goes viral).

, Decorate it however you like, and make it original! Don’t make the text hard to read. Don't use a white background with yellow text, or blue background with purple text. A white background with black text usually works best.


Pick a good profile name. For example, don't put your name but a weird or witty sounding name. Don't make it too long; most people won't type a 94- letter long name.
Use a good profile picture. Don't make it too dumb, because people won't think what you want them to think, and don't make it too cool, because people will know that you got that off the internet. Make your profile photo you or something not too funny.

, If you want to make a tutorial, make it simple and easy. If you want to make a funny video, do random things, and use the jump cut effect.


If you make tutorials, don't make them look complicated and hard. Use clear, short instructions and promise that the end result is something anyone can manage.

, Here is where you ensure the jump cuts. Cut all of the things that you don’t want. Make sure that it looks professional and is easy on the eye and ear.


Less is often more. Keep that in mind.

, Here are some things that may help:


The title has to be catchy. Include popular words if possible.
A catchy introduction fanfare that you put onto the beginning of every video will make your videos seem more professional and interesting. It also adds to building your brand if you use something that identifies your videos each time.
Introduce yourself and to say your name clearly so viewers will understand you. If they like your video and know who it's by (you), they will watch more.
Talk with ease, laugh a little at your mistakes. Depending on how interesting they are, you could even make bloopers at the end. Sure people will laugh at you, but you will most likely get a thumbs up.

, If you're just starting, Windows Movie Maker or iMovie are just fine. You can use more advanced stuff such as VSDC free video editor when your channel becomes more popular.

, When someone searches a video, there is a tab under the title saying ""NEW"". Once a week passes, the tab will vanish. Most people want a YouTuber who is current on YouTube.

Keep your videos short. Most people don't have time for a 46 minute video. Even if they do, they will probably stop it in the middle of your video.

, Clickbait is all the methods you can use to encourage viewers to view your video.Use this aggressive tool at a right level: too little will not attract the people and too much will give you a bad reputation. The goal is to promise impressive content to the viewer. The limit is not to promise more than your video actually provides.


On YouTube, clickbait mostly concerns the thumbnail and the title.

, Do not summarize your whole content, only spotlight the most unusual part to make your video unique. It's not important if the title does not describe the entire content. It only cites the reason why the video deserves to be viewed. Example: you have made a ten minute video on body training but at 7:23, you have broken the bar.

, To create clickbait, you have to search what makes the people react. People reacts on animals, deaths, births, accidents... If your video is related to this, put the most emotional element in the title.

, In the western civilization, most people share common values. A video talking about (not supporting) controversial ideas is likely to intrigue the people, make the people react and make them click on the video. Cite any destabilizing facts mentioned in the video.

, As with the title, keep the key elements. Choose symbols or iconic images to instantly describe the subject.

, No matter if the thumb is not realistic, it's only a symbolic representation of the content of the video. A thumb is small. The viewer should be able to quickly identify the elements. Example: feature your head and a ball if you are talking about soccer, even if the proportions are not respected.

,,, Tell anyone to check your videos out. Also subscribe and send friend requests to a bunch of people on YouTube. Make sure you respect all of your subscribers and answer their comments. You can also use social media sites to grow your fanbase such Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and Google Plus.

, Once you get a decent amount of views, make and add more content on a regular basis. Make videos focused on you, your friends, pranks, randomness, etc. Or keep building on your original storyline, such as the adventures of your puppy, the learning curve you experience cooking healthy food or the challenges you've set yourself to learn something new.

, It can take a while to build up popularity and it really is a waiting game. If you think too hard about being popular, it can do your head in and you may give up. Instead, keep persevering, adding quality material and expect more interest in about six to twelve months time. Of course, after a year has passed, if you're not well known despite doing all you can, you need to reassess what you're doing.

, Then put your videos on and share them around (make sure to have clicked on ""to"" and clicked on everyone on your list).

, Ask them politely to watch your videos––try to use an exciting reason that will entice them to look.


Subscribe to these people; it's an implied way of suggesting they owe you for subscribing!
If you personally know a popular YouTuber, ask them to give you a shoutout on their videos.

, Again, ask them to watch, subscribe or comment on your videos. If they subscribe, then their millions of followers will see and watch your videos too. This is, of course, a long shot but you never know.

, Ask them to help you spread the word to their friends. Don't be a pest doing this though; occasional well placed and polite requests are better than lots of groveling.

, The more interesting they are, the more people will be attracted to them. And if there are lots, people will start to take you seriously as someone who is willing to keep feeding their interest. Usually, good quality videos are considered to be 720p HD or 1080 p HD.

, That way, it might be mentioned in popular channels. For example, a channel like Failblog; if you make something that is an epic fail, submit it to FailBlog and with a little luck, you can be mentioned on FailBlog and maybe RayWilliamJohnson!

Do not post sexual content to get attention.,
Do not use frequent profanity.,
Do not bully other people!,
Use appropriate tags for your video!,
Don't harass people!",How to Behave on YouTube," You're just being stupid and your channel may be banned from posting content. YouTube is not a pornography site; it is designed for all ages.;
, Many people think it's cool, but it's really not in reality. A little bit of mild PG and PG-13 rated profanity is fine, but don't overdo it.

, Bullying is really hurtful. If you don't like being bullied and you bully others, then you probably should stop before you regret it. Try not to post violent videos and don't abuse your commenting privileges by constantly insulting others without any reason.

, Many people like using strong language and other inappropriate language to make people find their video. People may be mad if they were searching for a certain video, but they found yours instead by mistake.

, Harassing is annoying. If you don't like being harassed, then it's best that you don't do it either.

Be yourself.,

Don't hide emotions in your videos.,
Surround yourself with positive people.,
Consider the relationship you're in.,
When you first start your vlogs, don't expect to gain one million subscribers in one day.,
Don't compare your subscribers to massive YouTubers.,
Invest time and effort into vlogging because you are passionate about it.",How to Become a Successful Vlogger on YouTube1," When you are being yourself in your videos, you begin to become comfortable with yourself.


The danger of not being yourself is destroying trust with your subscribers. If you try to be someone else in your videos, that means you'll be acting in front of the camera every day. That can become tiring and un-fun.;
, Are you reaching out to the younger people? Older people? What are you going to be vlogging about? Consider these questions before making your way onto YouTube.

, Vlogging is like your diary. You show your emotions and tell your audience how you feel. Don't get on camera and act happy when you know you are feeling bad. Tell your viewers how you're feeling.

, Allow people into your life only if they are there to motivate you, not bring you down. When people are always criticizing you, sometimes that can effect your day and potentially ruin your mood. Talk things through with your family. See if they want to be in your vlogs. Ask them questions and see if they are okay with you letting them on the vlogs.

, Sometimes, putting your life on the internet may not always be suitable for your partner. Talk it through with your partner and see if it's okay!


There are dangers of vlogging your life on YouTube when you are in a relationship, because viewers are prone to criticizing it whether or not they know it. It will sometimes make you doubt your relationship.
Another danger is ""not knowing."" Sometimes, having a relationship with a person while on camera can become confusing. You will end up trying to figure out if you really love that person, or if your love for that person is only for the camera. Consider your relationship before making the step to become a vlogger.

,


Technically, when you first get on YouTube, you're probably like, ""Oh my gosh, I'm going to be famous now!"" This isn't really true. It takes years to gain that many subscribers, and once you realize that you don't have as many subscribers as you intended, you get frustrated easily.
Set realistic goals for yourself. Maybe in one video, try to get just five views on that video. Then on the next video, try to get ten views. Improve yourself and gradually build your views and subscribers.

,


First of all, it took those YouTubers years to get to their current position. Even they were limited in supplies when they first started YouTube. But they stuck around and continued to set realistic goals for themselves.

, Don't be in it for the money. Because when you realize that your vlogs aren't getting you money, you can get pretty upset.

Examples of makeup gurus on YouTube are jlovesmac1, MichellePhan, xteeener, kandeejohnson, teenbeauty channel and bubzbeauty.;
, The trick to becoming a makeup guru is to take note of what your viewers want and to use innovative techniques.

, MAC and Maybelline are good examples. Don't be afraid to try new types of makeup or techniques that you find interesting. Drugstore products also interest younger viewers as they are more affordable.

, Most of the girls that watch how-to's on makeup are in the age range of early teen years to late twenties. Try to make videos that will interest this age group.

, The best area to film is in a small room; you get better sound quality. Make sure that you have a camera with nice quality. A tripod that you can set up easily would also be beneficial.

, Put music in the background and edit them very well before posting. Be ""real"" with your viewers, and relate to them. Humor may be used at appropriate times.

Get the right lighting.,
Have a simple, but usual background.",How to Become a Successful Vlogger on YouTube2," You don't have to buy the best equipment or cameras for your vlogs. Most you should focus on is getting a camera with good HD quality, and one that provides good sound quality for your viewers. These can be found at any store near you.

, They don't even have to be catchy. It can just be a title that can trigger a particular memory in your audience. The title can be fun. The title can be wild. The title can even be mischievous! Here are some examples of fun titles:


A Trip to Peru!
I Went Sky Diving!
You Won't Believe What I Found / Trip To Peru pt. 3

, Usually, the best time to vlog is around 8:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. Those are the times when sunlight is most present.

, This is for if you are not vlogging around the house or in public.


You can even purchase a green screen. Later, when you've finished your video, you can edit a picture or background onto the green screen.

If you don't know how to navigate any of the above social media websites, Google it and see if you can fine some detailed instructions.

, This is a major thing you have to know how to use. Understand what you can to do to improve your videos.


At the time, you might be using Windows Movie Maker. That's fine. As stated above, you won't really need the best equipment to vlog. Eventually, you can find a better editing software of your choice.

, When you join YouTube, you're not going to automatically make money. Unless you're getting a good amount of views on your videos, don't quit your day job just yet.

, Ask them for suggestions and make them feel apart of your life. If you're looking for name suggestions, say, ""Guys, I'm looking for a good name for my hamster (or whatever the case may be). Let me know in the comments below what you think.""

, If your subscribers want you to do something, try to do it! It will build their trust in you.


Know when to say no. Some things that people will want you to do may not be healthy or good for you. Nicely tell your viewers in one of your vlogs how you feel about it. Remember! Your viewers are your family, so you must talk it through with them.

, Sure, you might notice a few dislikes here and there, but you should focus on what brings you joy. You should be too focused on making a difference than the negativity that is thrown at you.

, Comment on vlogs that address similar topics to yours. Subscribe to YouTube channels and invite vloggers to watch your content. Make friends with them!

Reward your viewers and thank them often.",How to Become More Successful on YouTube," It is best to start off from scratch when creating a channel dedicated to what you think could be successful on YouTube. Don’t just add new videos after reading the top ten tips to your badly named channel (e.g. catlover99), with videos of your cat from 2003 still available to view. Use a channel name that is well thought out, to show a professional and iconic channel for users to remember.


For example, a boy named John Smith who likes to sing covers could use numerous channel names like these: JohnSmith, JohnCovers, SmithSings. All easy to remember.
Users will search for your videos and you will soon show up in the first search page rankings and in the auto-remember search bar. That will bring a lot of website traffic to your channel. As well as this, if you do your research into what's trending with current subjects relating to your videos, you can get high views from posting the first video to a new topic (e.g. the first cover song of a certain artist).;
, Self promotion is of the utmost importance. Some sites will share out channels for free. YouTube gives you space around your channel to put in a cool layout, so use this space to your advantage. Many successful users use text and images to show their subscribers and followers their brand.


The ""brand"" refers to the way that you promote yourself and/or your company/gig and can help define who you are and what you do.
Attractive graphics can bring people back to channels, and help users remember you/your company, which is very important to becoming successful on YouTube.

, Naming and categorizing your videos correctly is vital to keeping users happy with your content. People like a descriptive title, and a description that's evaluative and truthful. If you lie in your title, you will get negatively thrashed in the ratings bar (putting viewers off instantly). So be sure to keep titles short whilst tagging videos effectively with relatable words to your videos such as: ""car"", ""vehicle"", ""lorry"". Many blogs refer to these techniques as ‘tricks of the trade’. However, in reality, YouTube originally set out the idea of tagging correctly as common sense, and it effectively names your videos appropriately, therefore you will get views from the correct audience. If you don’t you will fail, and end up posting videos in bad categories (like tagging a music cover with: ‘reviews’ ‘technology’... not good.)


When you first start out on YouTube, don’t expect any more than three ratings per video.

, When creating a video, produce high quality and fresh content for your audience to look forward to. If you keep a schedule of 'one video a week’ you can spend time working on your video. When shooting a video, there are many methods to success. If you are shooting yourself at a desk, be sure to buy a (white) light to sit in front of you and a high-definition camera to record your beautiful face. Nothing is more annoying than a blurry video, which has been shot in a dark room with rubbish sound and no faded music in the background.

, This simple yet vital aspect can help you to succeed when putting hard work into building and maintaining your channel.

, Success is made on YouTube, and YouTube has often been named as a ‘phenomenon’ for finding new talent and success. Justin Bieber made his fame from YouTube. Just posting videos and sharing them with friends led to him being the highest earning music artist teenager in the world, after being scouted by manager Scooter Braun. However, YouTube is not just for singers! If you have a talent of any sort and interest, show it off.


Be aware that the downfall in views after an original internet hit can be hard-hitting if you keep expecting 1,000,000 views per video that you post. It may seem obvious, but have goals and stick to them.
You will not get a following on YouTube in just one month, so be realistic. Such an astronomical response would be almost impossible unless you just documented the first alien landing on Earth. Keep with your initial ideas and make videos that cover the subject thoroughly and take advantage of interesting things able to catch the attention of viewers.
Never copy others. If it has already been seen, then it has already been... and gone. Plus, people don't like copying when they spot it.

, Add content that people want to watch. For example, if you like singing and want to upload cover videos, don't just sit at your desk singing and reading the lyrics to a song you like. Actually spend time learning the song and looking into the camera and add your own style to the video. Don’t just upload a video of you singing—mix it up! Throw in some videos of you singing at a talent show, or practicing singing in your car. If you create exciting content that is unpredictable, people will want to come back for more and see the ‘latest’ video coming from you/your channel.


For example, YouTube Star Austin Mahone built up 53,000,000 total video views in just one year, due to the fact he posted videos regularly and his content was exciting for his followers, known today as ‘Mahomies’.

, YouTube hosts many successful video bloggers such as iJustine and reviewers like SoldierKnowsBest, which for some, can be hard to compete with when trying to become successful. However, just like all other YouTubers, both of these example YouTube stars had regularly uploaded videos on a weekly basis. The consistent uploading of videos is the most important factor to gaining and keeping an audience––posting videos regularly is considered a full-time job and even a career for over 9,000 YouTubers. Regularity of new content is guaranteed to get you noticed on YouTube. And while such uploading might seem like a slow and never-ending process, it is worth the effort. After hitting the '50-video mark' (depending on content), any channel should gain a following that appreciates your material and content without feeling forced to subscribe. After all, you cannot be famous for doing nothing.


Regular can be daily, weekly or several times a week. If you are a busy person who is balancing work or school with YouTube, you might consider uploading weekly (use those weekends!).
If an idea is unique, then make a video about it! But be careful, as repetition is the main pitfall for those trying to become successful quickly on YouTube.
Focus on regularity over quantity––there is such a thing as too much at once. Some users consider that uploading 100 videos in one day to be the holy grail of gaining success. However, this will just lead to a bunch of unwatched videos that end up looking like spam, bringing next to nothing to the channel's total views.

, This means you will need to comment, like and subscribe to other channels to enable you to get noticed and hopefully subscribed to.

, There are various beneficial and caring ways to go about this, including:


Responding to popular videos is a way to gain views and can soon get you on your way to becoming a star on YouTube.
Create exciting content that relate to other videos, so that you can connect through commonality.
As well as posting videos in response to other videos, you need to give feedback to other users. It's best to comment on videos that are like yours (not that popular yet). This will get you connecting with the YouTube community, growing a trustworthy subscriber base for your channel and even new friends.
Try not to spam every video named “me singing” with a comment like “amazing” because where is the personal connection there? And don’t ask people to subscribe. The goal is to not appear like you are seeking fame.

, Don’t expect anything from anyone on YouTube. The less cocky you appear, the more likely you are able to seek success. Constantly asking for users to rate and subscribe will get boring very quickly. Just think how easily you get bored with mass emails sent to you and forty others. If you make people feel like just another number, you will not achieve anything. Treat your videos as a tool to give information/entertainment to people, and expect nothing in return.

, These accounts help you to keep your viewers rotating around your social media platforms.


Do not vlog if you don't have many fans. Only famous YouTubers' fans like to see what their idol is doing 24/7.

, You can do a giveaway when you reach your goal or milestone. You can also give shoutouts, follow your fans on Twitter or just simply make a thank you video.

Review your channel.",How to Become a YouTube Guru," Decide what talent or skill you want to showcase in your videos. Most YouTube gurus have one central focus that gives their videos cohesion and a kind of brand identity. Think about your passions and talents and how they could lend themselves to making videos. Also think about what kind of advice or guidance you want to share most with the world.Most YouTube gurus focus on beauty and makeup and fashion, though some also touch on subjects like lifestyle and mindfulness, fitness, and dating advice.
Keep in mind that the main purpose of gurus is to impart advice. Even if you want to draw from your personal life and tell stories, ask yourself what lessons or messages you want your viewers to learn from your experiences.;
, Log onto YouTube and create a channel. Your channel will be the central hub for all your videos, where viewers can learn more about you and become subscribers. Therefore it’s critical that every aspect of your channel is spotless and is a reflection of yourself and your videos. Pick a name for your channel that is simple and easy to remember and relates directly either to you or to the kind of videos you make.Many YouTube gurus use their name as their YouTube channel name. This is a simple way to pick out a channel name, and it also a great way to achieve name recognition.
If your name has already been taken, pick a name that relates to your videos in an interesting way. For example, if you do makeup videos, choose a name like “LacyLashes” or “Briannebeauty”.

, The visual component of your channel is extremely important because it gives your channel a look and feel that can attract subscribers. Your thumbnail is one of the most important visuals because it appears with your channel name under every video you make. Because of this, you want your thumbnail to be polished as well as crisp and clear even at a small size.Colorful pictures or photos with high contrast tend to be more readable.
Many YouTube gurus put a picture of their face as their thumbnail photo. A full body shot can get lost at a small size.

, Your banner is at the top of your channel page and is the most dominant image on the page. It should be attractive and appealing, but also relate to the tone of your videos. Many vloggers also include their username in large letters in their banners.For instance, if you want to make beauty videos with a very feminine feel, make sure your banner’s color palette and overall look has a cute and playful look. If you want to be an alternative style guru, use black, red and other edgy colors to reflect your style.
There are many editing programs that you can use to create your banner.
Check out the banners of your favorite vloggers for inspiration and ideas.

, Almost all successful YouTube gurus have an intro and an outro that they use for all their videos. These intros and outros act almost like the theme song of a television show, signalling to the audience what they are watching and making the videos more professional and cohesive.


Most intros and outros feature music and include the channel name as well as social media like Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr.
Make sure that the music you’re using isn’t copyrighted. If you use copyrighted music your videos will likely be taken down.

, Part of creating an identity for your channel is the way you talk and present yourself in your videos. Think about your personality. Are you bubbly and energetic, or are you more sarcastic and witty? Make a couple practice videos and focus on letting the best and most memorable parts of your personality shine through., If you want to achieve YouTube fame, you need to make sure to use a good camera. A camera can make a world of difference in the quality of the video. Even if you are able to give great advice and create good content, you may turn off potential viewers or subscribers with bad or blurry video quality. If you don’t already have a nice camera, purchase one that is in your budget.If your camera doesn’t have good sound quality, consider buying a microphone.

, Lighting is also an essential part of good video production, especially if you are trying to be a beauty or makeup guru. You have a couple options when it comes to lighting.Some vloggers prefer natural lighting with a window behind the camera. This way of lighting is more variable and less bright, but it can save you money if you don’t want to invest in equipment.
Other vloggers prefer to use lighting equipment which provides an even, precise light that is easily adjustable. You can use umbrella lights next to the cameras which emit an even lighting over a large amount of space.
If you are doing beauty videos, consider buying a ring light. A ring light goes around your camera and lights up and illuminates your whole face, which is optimal if you are demonstrating makeup.

, Before you film your videos, make sure that the background you are filming against is clean and minimalistic. You want your viewers focused on what you are saying and demonstrating, not on any clutter going on around you. Many vloggers prefer to film against the same background or backdrop to give all of their videos a signature feel., Even though you’ll edit in your intro segment, it’s always important to give a little spoken introduction before you get into the meat of your video. If it’s your first video ever, tell viewers what to expect from your channel and a little bit about yourself.


If you have previously made videos, tell your viewers your name and what you’re filming today. Also tell them how excited you are that you are going to be filming more often and diving deeper into your content.
You may decide to say something like, “Hello all, my name is Brittany and I’m new to Youtube! I’m really excited to start making videos about makeup, beauty and fashion because they’ve always been passions of mine! Today I’m doing a tutorial on how to apply winged eyeliner. If you enjoyed this video, make sure to hit the like button and subscribe to see more of my beauty tutorials!”

, If your video is too long, people may leave without watching the whole thing, which will affect your views numbers. Try to keep your videos under ten minutes, or at the most, fifteen minutes.


Think about writing down an outline of what you want to cover in your video. This will keep you on track if you lose focus midway through.
Don’t be afraid of messing up when you’re filming. Most vloggers rely on editing to create the perfect video.

, When you finish your video, say goodbye to your viewers and remind them to subscribe to your channel and check out your social media.You could say something like, “Well that’s it for today! Thanks so much for watching, and if you liked this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up. If you haven’t already, subscribe to my channel and check out my Twitter and Instagram for more updates!”

, Use the Internet to find the best program or application to edit your video. First edit out any major mistakes or slip ups you made while filming. Then pare down some of the material to make the video flow better. You can also add additional elements like music, visual effects or sound effects.If you add in music, make sure it isn’t copyrighted.

, Upload the video to your channel. Uploading the video itself is fairly straightforward, but there are a couple additional elements you should be sure to include with your upload.Title your video something simple that relates to your content. For example, you could title a video, “Tips for Yoga Beginners” or “Wedding Hairstyle Tutorial”. Remember that if you title it something obscure, it won’t come up as a result when people look for videos on that subject matter.
Edit the description box to include a brief description of your video. For example you could write, “Welcome to your crash-course on my signature smokey eye look! A smokey eye is a bold and sultry look that’s great on any skin type.”
Also include links to your social media in the description box.
Include tags for your video that relate to the content. For example, if you are uploading a video on fall fashion for girls, some relevant tags could be: fashion, fall, back to school, trends, outfits, for school.

, Try to upload at least one video every seven to ten days. You may find uploading on the same day of the week works best for your followers because then they know when to look for new videos., Be open and honest in your videos. The best YouTube gurus make their subscribers feel like their friends and confidants. Even if your videos are straightforward tutorials, still try to inject your personality into them.Showing yourself as a real person with flaws and vulnerabilities will make your viewers remember you and seek out your videos.
Consider making “storytime” videos where you share funny or interesting stories from your daily life. These are a great way to share yourself a little more with your subscribers.

, Taking the time to respond to comments from viewers builds a solid relationship between you and your followers. It’s a way to maintain and grow your fanbase, but also a way to get the positive feedback you need to motivate yourself. The critical feedback you receive can also be helpful because it will show you where you need to refine your videos to become the best that you can be.Don’t be discouraged by negative comments. It’s impossible to be successful on YouTube and not get a negative comment or two. Make sure that you take constructive criticism to mind, but don’t hesitate to take down inappropriate, hurtful or spammy comments.

, Use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or other social media sites to interact with your fans outside of Youtube. Using an array of different sites lets you reach fans in different ways and helps them to get to know you better.Use social media not only to connect with fans you already have, but also to promote your YouTube videos to attract new fans.

, Find other vloggers that you find inspiring and subscribe to their channel. Leave positive and personalized comments on videos that you enjoy. Try to build online friendships with other vloggers by connecting through comments and social media, or through Youtube-specific events or conventions.


Subscribe on social media to vloggers you admire. Try to pick vloggers with around the same number of followers as you, because it will be harder to make a connection with bigger names.
There are a number of YouTube conferences such as VidCon that are great ways to meet other vloggers and share information.
Don’t feel that you have to make connections with vloggers that do the same kind of videos as you. For instance, if you do natural makeup on your channel and they do costume and Halloween-style makeup, it’s still worth it to make a connection because you can learn a lot from each other.
Don’t think of other vloggers as competitors. Building relationships with other vloggers is a great learning experience and could even gain you more subscribers.

, Once you have made a connection with another Youtuber, ask them if they want to collab. Doing a collab means that you and the other vlogger will make a video together. Collab videos give you the opportunity to gain a whole new set of subscribers and are great for expanding your fan base.Sometimes, vloggers do collabs where they aren’t in the the same video, but they both make a video about the same topic and link the other vlogger’s video in the description box.
Don’t ask someone to do a collab with you unless you have connected with them and have had some kind of back and forth.

, Once your YouTube channel gains momentum, companies may start contacting you to review their products. They may give you the products for free or offer to give them to you in exchange for a positive video review. Don’t lie on your videos about the quality of a product. You need to protect the integrity of your channel and be honest with your viewers.


If a company gives you a product that you feel is substandard, be honest. Tell the company that you did not have success with the product, and that you can either give the product a mediocre review on your channel or simply not review the product at all.

, If you are working a day job, remember to keep up with it no matter how successful and distracting your newfound popularity may be. Many beauty and fashion gurus hold jobs that relate to their channel, such as working as a makeup artist or in the fashion industry. Consider doing this to get more in touch with your passions.


You also may reach a point where you are getting enough money from sponsorships and YouTube to quit your job. Weigh your options extremely carefully before quitting your day job., Even if your channel is successful, you should always strive to make it even better. Take a step back and view your channel with a critical eye. Look at which videos got the most views and positive reactions and which got the least amount of views. Also take the constructive criticism of your fans into account. Consider the direction in which you want to take your channel based on what has worked for you so far.

After this, you’ll see a prompt to create a channel. Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.If you already have an account with Google, you have a YouTube account. Enter the same username and password you use to log into Gmail, Google+, etc.;
, Any camera will work in the beginning. Webcams, cell phone cameras, or digital cameras are good choices. If you can afford it, consider buying something more sophisticated. Consumer-level video cameras can be found for under $300.If you’re really serious, invest in an HD video camera or even a high-end DSLR. These videos produce higher-quality videos that will attract a larger following to your channel.
Laptop, tablet, and desktop computers usually come with at least one free recording program installed. For Mac users, this is Quicktime. For Windows users, this is Windows Media Maker.

, Make a list of your best attributes.Use your amazing voice to become a singer. Take advantage of your debating skills to become an editorial presenter. Draw on your extensive knowledge of art history to become an online lecturer. Choose one quality to use as your brand.

, Open a browser window in Private or Incognito mode to see trending videos that aren’t based on your previous viewing habits. On the left-hand side of the page, click “Trending,” which is the second link. Videos listed under the headings “Trending” and “Shared and Liked” have the most views. Other ways of finding out what’s popular include:


Asking your friends what they’re watching.
Checking your social media account to see what’s trending.
Searching phrases like “popular YouTube videos” through search engines like Google or Bing.

, Now that you know what’s out there, you need to go a step further. If you want to record an op-ed about hate speech, you’ll have competition. Think of an angle that can make your channel stand out. Consider the age group and interests of your target audience. Ask yourself if the name of your channel implies any unique ideas. Think about what you’d like to see but can’t find. Consider if you can make multiple videos on your concept., Find YouTube stars whose channels are similar to yours. Ask them if they’d like to collaborate with you on a few videos. Tell them you really like their content and that you’d like to work with them on a project. Pitch whatever ideas you have, even if they’re sketchy. You can send a private message like this:


Click the username of the channel owner, which you can find below the title of the video.
When you get to the channel page, click the “About” tab.
At the upper right, click the “Send Message"" button.
Type your message, and click “Send.”

, Take your smartphone or video camera everywhere. Maybe you’ll get lucky and catch something hilarious that could eventually go viral. You could even catch something more serious and help to bring justice to an innocent person. If the footage won’t work for your current project, save the file for later.

, Pay attention to different camera angles, close-ups, and scene transitions. If your video focuses on your face for several minutes, change it up with a change in angle (from frontal to three-quarter, for example). If you’re doing a demonstration, get a close-up of the project you’re working on. Listen for background music or white noise in the soundtrack. You don’t have to copy these things exactly, but it helps to know where in your video to put certain elements., While you’re waiting for your video to upload, set your channel to notify subscribers when you add new content. Click “Advanced Settings,” and scroll down to “Distribution Options.” The option “Notify Subscribers” should be checked automatically. If it’s not, check it. This way, everyone who subscribes to your channel will receive an email when you upload new content.


On the other hand, if you decide to upload multiple videos at once, uncheck the notification box. If you upload 20 videos in one day, your subscribers could get angry for the 20 emails they’ll receive as a result., After you upload your video, you’ll have the chance to set and edit automatic captions. No matter how clearly you speak, automatic captions contain loads of mistakes. This is unfair to your deaf and hearing-impaired viewers. Take the time to read and correct the captions after you upload your video. Ask your viewers to let you know if they see any errors.

, Replying to comments on your channel is a great start, but it’s not enough. Start conversations on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. Use specific hashtags on live chats to make it easier for your fans to find the discussion. Interacting not only makes your current audience think more highly of you, it can also draw new viewers to your channel.

, Few YouTubers become an instant hit with their first video. Most have to work hard just to get their viewing stats into double digits. Be patient, and use every opportunity you have to promote your channel., Below every video on YouTube is an arrow with the word “Share” next to it. Click it, and choose the icon of which website you’d like to post to. A pop-up window with a summary of your video will open. You can either edit the summary or leave it as it is. Just don’t alter the link! Websites like Twitter and Facebook will play the videos without having to open a new window or tab.

, Search the web or YouTube to see which channels are running contests.Find a contest that pertains to your channel, and read the rules. If the deadline gives you enough time to make a video, enter the contest. Usually, viewers have to vote on how entertaining, educational, funny, etc. a video is. If viewers like your video, they’ll likely head over to your channel and subscribe.

, Contact all your friends and family members in your address book. Try something simple like, “Hey, everybody! Check out this video I posted to YouTube. Let me know what you think.” Chances are, they’ll forward the link to even more potential viewers.

, Tags make search engines use your videos as results when someone looks up certain terms. Funny cat videos should have tags like “comedy,” “cats,” “cute,” etc. Make sure you stick to tags that accurately describe your video and channel. Don’t use inaccurate tags just to get more views. You’ll feel dishonest, and disappointed viewers will leave negative comments.

, By default, YouTube selects three stills from your video to use as the thumbnail image. If none of the selected stills accurately describe your video, create your own image. Take a selfie, a screenshot, or any other image that gives an eye-catching visual description of your video. Include a few lines of text that elaborate the image and flesh out the video’s title., No first-time video is perfect. If a viewer praises you for your script delivery but noted that the background noise was distracting, look for free and easy ways to erase unnecessary audio. Making small improvements to each video will eventually lead to a very professional-looking channel.

",How to Become a Beauty Guru on YouTube," Pick a good username. It should be catchy, a name that is easy to remember. You can never go wrong with using your first name and then something that describes your channel, such as BeautyByRachel or TiffanyNails.


Avoid long strings of numbers. This looks unprofessional and isn't easy to remember.
Avoid being silly. If you want guru status, you need to be taken seriously.;
, Add a nice background, for example. There are many programs that you can use to do this. Remember, don't overdo it- just chose something that best describes you. A good way to get views is to set the video on your channel to autoplay.

, Watching other gurus' videos is a great way to learn about what types of videos are successful.


Obviously, don't copy what they're doing. Use their examples to inspire your own unique take on presenting your videos and content.

, Just remember that they have been on YouTube for a long time, so they have lots of experience.

, Plan your videos out ahead of time; if you don't, there is a risk you'll ramble on or fail to engage the audience. Find some topics you think people are ,most interested in, but also throw in some unique ideas from your own head. Be sure to vary your videos. (For example, don't make every other video a makeup tutorial.) You can also occasionally collaborate with other Youtubers you do the same things as you.


Make sure to have good lighting (sunlight or a bright inside light) and good audio.
Speak clearly and loudly.

, Keep the videos at around 6-8 minutes (or shorter). Try not to ramble; instead, get to the point and discuss the video topic. (This is why planning before shooting matters.)

, Use a program such as iMovie (Mac) or Windows Movie Maker (PC).

, Keeping things new and fresh is important and brings your viewers back frequently.

, This is how new viewers will find your videos, because they will find them through searching YouTube.


Use a descriptive title as well. So instead of ""My Hair Routine,"" use a title such as: ""My Curly Hair Styling Routine for Shiny, Defined Curls.""

,, Make sure to reply to comments and answer questions. In the start, reply to as many as you can. After you gain a lot more subscribers, it's basically impossible to reply to all of them, but at least try to do 2-3 per video.


Ignore any negative, non-constructive comments. Everyone gets nasty comments on YouTube, and the best policy is to not reply to them (don't feed the trolls). If they bother you, delete the comments. And if they leave multiple negative comments on your videos, just block them.
If negative feedback is constructive, respond to it properly. Thank the viewer for pointing out what you could do better, promise to try a different way and let them know that they have been helpful. Not all negative comments are a fail.

, This will help to keep your subscribers updated with the latest news and videos. Do this once you've accumulated a lot of subscribers.

, Do this once you have a solid amount of people that watch your videos when you upload them. This is around 750-2000ish views. If you are accepted, you will get more capacity to personalize your channel and you will be able to earn money from video ad revenue.

, obviously your crew/partner will be at a far point, so there's no way the camera will be able to hear you. Learn how the system works. Get a microphone and hook it up to any of your clothing but make sure that it's hidden and isn't visible to the person the prank will be played on.

Do you have a skill for Pivot Stickfigure Animator, do people find you randomly funny? Whatever your strong suit of comedy is, make this the base that you use for the majority of your videos. If you like a few different genres of comedy, mix them together or have some parody videos, some sketches, etc. If you can't think of any, then say what you think in your mind. But don't take it too far and make it offensive.;
, Your title could be simple or long, it doesn't really matter as long as it's catchy and people will remember it. Using alliteration or rhymes might help your title stick into others' minds. Before posting your video, don't forget to research your title to make sure that it doesn't already exist.

, Although it's possible to make great YouTube videos all by yourself, getting some other people to help you out by acting, filming, and editing will not only make it easier for you, it's more fun and your video looks more professional.

, Choose a camera and get out and film. If possible, filming with a real video camera is the best option, as the video quality is high. However, you can also use the video function on your digital camera. If need be, a last-resort choice would be a webcam. Webcams are usually low-quality, blurry, and experience a bit of lag, so unless yours is high-quality, opt for something else. If you have tripods or boom microphones that you're able to use, these can boost the quality of your video.

, Ryan Higa/Nigahiga (a very famous comedian on YouTube) kept his bloopers, as did Jim Carrey's comedy movies. Use it at the end of all videos, possibly while the credits are running to keep viewers entertained. Bloopers are almost always funny and will keep your audience smiling until the very end of your video.

, It's now time to upload them to YouTube, make an account or sign in. Your video should be under 10 minutes long unless it's a special of some sort (such as a Christmas Special).

, If you want to make it faster, show your video to your friends and tell them to tell it others. Post your videos as video responses to famous comedy videos to increase the chance of them being watched.

, The more subscribers the better, and the more you'll get famous and well-known. Do not spam people!

, You don't want your subscribers to leave, so repeat this process over and over again. Make even more funny ones and be friends with other comedians so you can make films together.

Get yourself out there!",How to Be an Equestrian YouTuber," Many computers come with basic video editing software, such as iMovie on Macs or Windows Movie Maker (WMM)on PCs. These are absolutely fine to use, however you will find that the equestrian youtubers with the most subscribers, likes, and comments all have more advanced software. Sony Vegas and Final Cut Pro X (FCPX) are most common. Sony has released many different models of ""Vegas"", prices ranging from under £40 to over £500. The cheaper versions are still sufficiently advanced for many equestrian youtubing purposes. FCPX is at a fixed price of £199.99, and only available on Macs. It is at around the same level as cheaper Sony Vegas models.;
, While your up the yard, don't be embarrassed to ask people to film you riding! It's important to have new clips to make your videos with, so you can let people know what you and your horse have been up to.

, There are many tutorials on the web , use them to make your videos great!

, Being an absent youtuber isn't going to get you any subscribers! Try to upload videos with new clips at least once every two weeks.

, This will get you noticed, and people will subscribe to you! A MEP (Multi Editor Production) is when a load of people all club together to make one huge video. It's an effective way to announce your presence and get you and your videos seen. Many people run YouTube ""contests"" too, in which people can enter their horse/pony by uploading a video of themselves doing whatever the contest host asks. Prizes often include a ""promo"", where somebody makes a video of you telling others to subscribe!

, Once you become an established equestrian youtuber, you may want to host your own MEP. You will need something to download people's parts with. And if you run a contest offering a promo as the prize, you will need to download your prizewinner's clips in order to make the promo!

, This means that when somebody subscribes to you, you sub back! This is a very effective way to earn more subscribers.

, You could use Photoshop to make this, which achieves the best results, however many online photo editing websites offer a 'collage' function so you can simply make a background from all your pictures.

, Comment and rate other people's videos. You'll get noticed and others will visit your channel and watch your videos. Also subscribe to other people, you can gain ideas from their videos to improve your own.

Choose your guru field.,
Gather all the materials you'll need.,
Watch other gurus.,
Get a good quality camera.,
Plan out your videos.",How to Be a Guru on YouTube," People on YouTube love looking for gurus who specialize in an area and are a wealth of information to do with the subject. For example, if you want to do fashion and make-up, consider what you know about these already. Do you know enough, do you need to do research, do you think it is an area that you'll stay passionate about for years to come?


It is probably best to focus on what you're passionate about. You'll feel jaded if you're trying to be a guru in an area that you consider popular but hardly has any interest for you personally.;
, If you're going to talk about items, you'll need them to show. Will you borrow them or buy them? Can you source them from cheap stores or suppliers? Do you already own the items? Or, maybe you are going to be a guru on all things intellectual, in which case you'll need good information sources, such as a bookmarked list of websites, Twitter updates from relevant sources and books, etc.

, Learn from people who are already successful in their field of interest on YouTube and have lots of subscribers to their channel. Consider what they're doing right, what you could do better and what you can learn from their styles of presentation. Make notes and follow up when planning your own videos.


If you make friends on YouTube, then you can discuss video ideas and watch their reviews so you can also recommend the product.

, If you're going to be a guru on YouTube, you're going to need a way to post videos, right? Choices include: a camera built into a webcam, laptop, or cell phone, a video option on a digital camera or a digital video camera.

, Planning the videos is essential. You'll probably have all sorts of ideas but they're a jumble until you put them into an outline and plan how you'll present each item and piece of information.


Plan what you'll say, do and show.
Plan how often you'll release videos.
Plan whether you'll offer a mix of information, tutorials, news, stories, etc. or whether you'll always do one style of presentation, etc.

Try Livestream when you think you're ready for it.",How to Be a Good Gaming Commentator on YouTube," If you haven't done such already, create a channel with the intention of gaming commentating.


Have a nickname. Make it clear and short so it catchy and people will actually enjoy saying it. A nickname is, of course, optional, but a lot of commentators have a nickname and it is part of your personal ""branding"".;
, It's recommended that you select one game that you're really good at and enjoy playing, to begin with. That way, the inspiration for your commentary won't be hard to come by and you'll probably have lots of interesting things to talk about, especially all the quirks, Easter eggs, mods and other things that you know about in relation to this specific game. As your channel becomes more popular, you can branch out to other games.

, Are you going to be comedic, dramatic, informative, or something else? Work with your natural personality and style, as this is far easier to maintain. For example, it's easier to be your natural self rather than trying to be peppy all the time when you're naturally sarcastic, and vice versa.

, You could use something you've heard and modify it to fit your gaming style or you can come up with something completely original. For example, a well-known YouTube commentator, PewDiePie, uses the word 'Bro' to refer to his subscribers. He's got more sayings too, and it's even better because it causes his channel to be different and more fun from other gaming channels.


It's nice if you can match the name you make up for your subscribers with the style of your videos or the games you're commenting on. For example, ""Minecrafters"", ""CoDfans"" or ""Simsters"". You will do best if you directly talk to your subscribers during your commentary, so that they feel you're connecting with them and that they're included.

, Don't copy what they say and do, but use their examples to learn from. What sorts of things about their commentary engages you and encourages you to keep listening and learning? Adapt that knowledge to inform the manner in which you present your commentary.

, A lot of ums, aahs and cuts due to blanking out can drive viewers bananas. Give them a well rehearsed and fluid performance, so that they're looking at a professional.


Write out script prompts or bullet points of things to address, whatever works for you. Be sure to have a game plan so that you're not just rambling and making stuff up as you go.
That said, it's still very useful to be flexible and spontaneous; not everything can be scripted and some of your best moments may be those that pop up when something unexpected happens during the gameplay. In which case, go with the flow and allow your surprise, confusion or annoyance come through, in just the way that another gamer would probably respond. It feels more real and provided you pick up the flow again, people will love it.

, Set up your recording computer and other equipment where you won't be disturbed by people or noises. Anything in the background that adds noise will spoil the video and make it hard for the viewer to concentrate. Do everything in your power to make it professional and easy for the viewer. If you don't, the viewer will find someone who does.

, Use a good headset or microphone. Ensure that there is no static, screeching, and/or quiet speaking. However, if you are just starting out or can't afford a headset or microphone, then your subscribers will surely understand––just let them know and tell them you're saving up for better gear. Ask for these things as gifts from family and friends. Make sure you have a PC powerful enough to run the games you play at good frames while recording.

, Don't Let's Play on an empty stomach, Eat well to stay healthy and nourished. Gurgling stomachs and a light head won't help the commentary.

, It's much simpler and quicker to do commentaries with short videos, and they are good for seeing how the community will react to your videos. It's also best for the beginner because you'll feel less intimidated about how much effort you need to put in.

, This means to have a professional looking video introduction. An introduction makes your video look much more professional. Even a simple fade in the beginning will be better than to start instantaneously. You will need a good program to help you make a decent introduction, such as Adobe After Effects. Windows Movie Maker may not be as useful for this but if it's all you have, give it a try.


See the next step for suggestions on what to talk about in the intro.

, Following your script prompts or bullet points, play the game part that you've chosen for the video commentating. Talk clearly into the microphone area and avoid coughing, sniffling, burping or any other distracting noises. Things you might commentate on include:



The introduction: This should discuss why you're choosing this game/this game section/this gameplay and what you are hoping to show your viewers. Tell them what the aim of the Let's Play is at the outset, so that they can decide whether or not to keep watching. Do not leave the purpose of your video unknown until the end, as it'll just encourage the viewer to leave; be clear from the start.

The commentary: Talk about how you're playing the game, the tricks you've discovered, the hairy parts to avoid or manage well, the ways in which you use weaponry/skills/strategy, etc. to overcome obstacles/survive/obtain gems/win, etc. Discuss the strategies you've worked out for being successful.

Talking about mods: If you're good with mods, talk about how to add them, what they can do and how readers can find them or make their own. Realize that a lot of people would love to use mods but are unsure of what to do, so be reassuring and offer a link to the basic of mods in the text underneath your video.

Assume nothing. While you don't want to repeat the wheel every time, always remember that you'll have new viewers who are unfamiliar with what you already know. Even though some things may be basic, it is always kind to mention new viewers and direct them as to where to find help. For example: ""For those of you who are new to this, I'd suggest checking my link below to the basic tutorial, if you're unsure what to do."" That'll take care of them without being rude and you don't have to go into copious detail and bore the more advanced viewers. Avoid derogatory terms such as noobs, as it just smacks of arrogance and will lose you viewers. Remember that new people can often bring fresh ideas and new ways of looking at things that might spark interesting future commentaries.

, Be sure to talk to your subscribers, not at them. By using your term for your subscribers often, they'll feel a part of the gaming. And every now and then, say the name of a specific subscriber. It's only natural to appreciate being singled out and spoken to directly; it feels special and such subscribers will keep coming back for more. Be generous with this!


For example: ""Hey Simsters, I know some of you were keen to learn about how to make your Sims clean the toilet more often. Today I'll show you just how that works.""
Another example: ""Flesheatingflower, you wanted to know how to build a firepit in the middle of your house from morphing blocks. I am going to start out with just that today, so I hope it'll help you!""

, It's only going to be a terrific video if you like to play. Play only when you want, play what you want, it's your decision.


Consider that you can be really subscriber-friendly by playing a custom map or story one of your subscribers suggest in the comments section.

, Adding some text or a picture on some situations can help to make the video seem more exciting, spooky, fun or just generally more interesting. Don't edit too much though, unless the main purpose of the video is showing an edit. The raw gameplay is what people have come to see and hear about, so as long as you've got some good commentary and quality filming, you'll be all set.

, Aside from clear audio, another must in the YouTube business is uploading plenty of videos regularly. Determine how often you can edit videos. It should be at least 3 times a week but you should try for 2 videos a day or more if you are able to. Pre-recording plenty of videos and even setting up scheduled uploads will help with this.

, If you get popular, remember to actively do things for your subscribers. If you get, say, thousands or more subscribers, majority of them will expect a new video from you for once per week at least.


Have a certain rate of video making. At least once per week is good, but more often leads to happier subscribers.

, Reminding your viewers to subscribe, favorite a video, or like a video too often (and, sometimes, at all) will make it seem like you're desperate or will just sound so cliché that they stop listening. Just leave a link in the description of your video to your channel saying, ""Subscribe!"" Some people don't say anything at all and just let people do what they like, which when you think about it, is the coolest of all.

, Respond to the comments that ask questions and are polite. YouTube is known for its unfair share of rude, thoughtless and inconsiderate comments; ignore those. Respond to the comments that matter, the ones that are constructive and the ones that are polite, thoughtful and friendly. Those are the viewers you want to return and if you don't feed the trolls, you'll enjoy the experience a whole lot more.

, This will allow you to address a range of questions that you might have gathered over the various weeks and makes for an excellent way to comment without having to think too much about the script yourself. Your viewers will love having their questions answered and you can make it a regular feature, with plenty of build-up to encourage them to ask questions for each such session.

, If you're popular in YouTube, set up a Livestream. Places like YouTube and Twitch.TV are simple and can give the audience real-time chatting about your video. Although, at this point you will really need to consider making someone you trust a moderator to keep the order in there, to make it more pleasurable to others, as the chat stream can easily get out of hand.

Disabled commenting itself might also be a clue, as is a large number of ""dislike"" votes.;
, Clumsier ones ask you to turn up the volume on the speakers for some reason, or no reason at all. Better ones simply have low volume, forcing you to turn it up. Look at the time.

, Don't get blamed for waking the neighbors up with an earsplitting scream from your volumed-up speakers! This applies to headphones as well, for your own sake.

, The more dislikes a video has, the less popular it is. Additionally, if a video is flagged as inappropriate multiple times, it may be removed by site management.

, If you can't hear the scream, it actually might be fun to watch.

, The pranksters who upload these videos often tag them and title them with popular search results, so that music video or sports car commercial may not really be as they seem.

, Pause the video, and slowly move the mouse pointer left and right over the grey bar between the video and the controls. You will see a small thumbnail pop up above the mouse pointer.

Post consistently.",How to Be a Good YouTuber," More than anything else you can do on YouTube, maintaining a positive attitude in everything you do--from commenting to uploading--will set you apart from a large amount of YouTube users. This doesn't mean you have to pretend to be happy or enthusiastic all the time, but you should treat other users with respect and take the high road when others attempt to bring you down.


Any time you make a comment or upload a video, you expose yourself to criticism. Some users will likely make rude or negative comments--if so, simply ignore them and continue your positivity.;
, When you legitimately enjoy a video, click the ""Like"" button. The ""Like"" button, which is shaped like a thumbs-up gesture, is usually below and to the right of the YouTube video player window.


Similarly, refrain from using the ""Dislike"" button unless a video truly offends or hurts you or others.
Video Likes are one component of the various criteria used to determine how successful a video is. By liking a video, you are helping another content creator continue to grow.

, If you've found that you tend to come back to a certain channel to watch or re-watch its videos, subscribing to it benefits both you--because you'll receive a notification whenever it uploads a new video--and the creator, because the number of subscriptions a channel has contributes to its perceived success.


YouTube channels with enough subscriptions are sometimes nominated for awards or featured on the ""Trending"" page as well.
Subscribing to a YouTube channel gives you the chance to be part of that channel's community.

, This is a great way to spread positivity as well as contributing feedback. For example, if you particularly enjoyed the theme of a specific video from one of your subscriptions, consider letting them know why you liked it in the comments.


Remember to be constructive with your feedback. If you really didn't like a video for personal reasons, there's no need to disrespect the author or the video itself.

, Even if you don't intend for your comment to be negative, asking for people to check out your channel or lecturing other users on their spelling can be construed as spam. Remember, only comment when you have something positive and thought-provoking to add to the video discussions.


Similarly, don't send messages to YouTube content creators asking for collaborations, shout-outs, subscription requests, or any other kind of favor.

, Creating a YouTube account grants you a channel, but you'll need to personalize it if you want it to appear attractive to inquisitive subscribers. Possible content you can have here includes the following:


A custom banner at the top of your channel
A user profile image
A channel description

, If you already have several videos on your channel, you can choose one to display on the front page of your channel. This should be a video that gives users an idea of the kind of content you'll be posting.


For example, if you predominately post gaming videos, you'd want to feature your best gaming video here.
You can also create a video specifically for the featured video slot. Be sure to keep this video around two minutes long (or less).

, You'll want to do this once you've created enough videos to warrant categorization. Playlists give new subscribers a way to view your old videos in the order in which they were posted without having to scroll all the way down to the bottom of your channel.


Every video in a playlist should have a common theme with the other videos in the playlist. For example, a playlist on a gaming channel entitled ""Let's Plays"" would include all ""Let's Play"" videos on the channel.
Be sure to organize your videos in reverse chronological order (e.g., oldest video first) in your playlists.

, As you start posting content, people will likely begin commenting on your videos and leaving you messages. This is a good opportunity for you to build a reputation as someone who reads user feedback and incorporates it into your creation process.


Once your channel starts growing, it will become difficult to keep up with every single comment. Don't worry about talking to or looking at every user in the comments section--simply reviewing the comment section for half an hour or so should give you a good idea of what people are talking about.

, It may be tempting to try to make a living from YouTube, but the reality of the situation is that your videos will always be more engaging if you stick to producing what you love.While certain sections of YouTube have huge amounts of content being produced each day (e.g., the gaming community and the makeup community), that shouldn't keep you from creating that kind of content if you want to.

, If you're simply using it as a place to store the old videos in your iPhone, consider making your videos private. This way, only you will have access to them. If, on the other hand, you plan on posting your videos for a large audience, it's helpful to have an idea of your end goal.


If you want to create a career on YouTube, you'll want to try to make your videos as professional-looking as possible. This will include researching your topics.
If you're making a channel dedicated to your own likes and interests, you'll have a lot more creative freedom in what you post. Even so, keeping your channel focused on one category of content (e.g., gaming, news, entertainment) will make your channel look tidy.
You can make a video private during the uploading process.

, You don't need to have a theme or a 40-page screenplay to be a good YouTuber, but knowing what you want to create before you hit that ""Record"" button will keep your videos focused and interesting.


Writing and memorizing a short script before you record might help you stay on track.
Similarly, writing down the content you'd like to cover for your video will also help you stay focused.
Your video plan should line up with your reason for posting on YouTube. For example, if your reason for posting on YouTube is to provide users with well-researched news, your video plan should focus on that topic exclusively.

, Metadata is any non-video aspect of your video production. It includes the following components:Video Title - This should be an eye-grabbing, concise title (e.g., ""Election Results & What's Next"").

Video Description - Cover the basics of what's going into the video. If you state facts, cite your sources here. You can also add timestamps that serve as a table of contents for your video so users can quickly jump to a specific in-video topic.

Video Thumbnail - This is a picture that sums up the content of the video. Try to keep the general appearance of your thumbnail consistent between videos.

Video Tags - These are keywords that help categorize your video. For more reference on what to use as your video tags, look at other users' videos in the same category to see which tags they're using.

, Simply observing good grammar and formatting will make your videos appear professional.


This also applies to YouTube video descriptions, in which you'll also need to use proper punctuation.

, Especially once you have subscribers looking forward to your content, you'll want to upload at around the same time each week (or each day, etc.)."

Make a promising channel art.,
Post quality content.",How to Attract YouTube Subscribers," This is one the most important parts of the process, so make sure you've got yourself a decent video editing software that shows your viewers that you can edit and are a professional. Most of the 'good' editing softwares out there are a bit pricy, so start off with the ones that provide a free trial limit (normally 30 days). If you're on a Mac, ScreenFlow is the best one to try out due to its numerous features that should make you look like a professional. If you are on Windows, try out Camtasia which provides quality features to make your videos look attractive.;
, This will probably be your most used software. The key to get viewers clicking on your videos is thumbnails. You need to assign quality, rich, appealing thumbnails to your videos making them represent the video in just a single image. The best free software, by far, for Mac, Windows, and Linux is Gimp. Gimp is just like Photoshop, only free. Learn what your viewers like, how they like it, and make those type of images. This will eventually make your viewers say ""He's really putting in some work"", and eventually subscribe.

, The channel art represents what your channel is all about in a single picture. Make it look promising and beautiful. Download the channel art layout which YouTube provides for free, and work on it (using Gimp). Something simple and elegant should be enough. On the other hand, do make sure you add up links such as 3rd party fan-pages on your channel art. This makes your viewers say ""He does have a lot"" and eventually subscribe.

, Make sure your videos are quality content and by quality; we don't just mean 720p - 1080p, but make them bright! Try you're best not to make them dull and dry. Make sure you cut out the parts of your videos which don't need to be there. Put time and effort in them. Hard work is one of the most important things you'll need to do in order to gain subscribers.

, Something that will make people think ""Oh that video will probably be pretty good, I should totally go watch it right now.""

, Put links in the downbar and ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel and all that good stuff.

, When you're first starting off, you don't necessarily have to have ALL of the equipment but if your audience starts to broaden then the best things to get is a good camera. Then a tripod and maybe some white lights, but natural lighting is good, too. The camera doesn't have to be really expensive, because it's not just about the camera, it's mostly about the lens.

, Like edit a picture of you and then put words and clip art on it.

, YouTube is supposed to be fun so be silly, weird, funny, and enjoy it.

Don't get a community guidelines strikes to begin with.",How to Appeal a Community Guidelines Strike from YouTube," YouTube has very certain rules for what you can/can't upload. As a major internet website, they always ask users to be respectful and responsible with whatever content you post on their site. They will do what they need to do to protect the integrity of the company and to protect their community of people who tune to the website.

For example, you can't upload anything with pornography or sexual content, anything that encourage others to do things that might cause them to get badly hurt, anything that's violent or with graphic content,  spam, threats, etc. If users feel your video is in violation of the Community Guidelines, it will be flagged and checked carefully by the YouTube community. If you violated the rules, the video will be removed from the website.;
, YouTube only allows users to appeal a community guidelines strike one time; that's it. If YouTube decides to uphold their decision to remove your video, you will not be allowed to appeal future strikes on any videos in your account for 60 days.

YouTube does understand that not all users intend to violate the rules; so you also have the option of waiting 3 months for the original strike to expire. If you do that; pending you don't upload any further videos that violate the Community Guidelines, the strike will expire and your account will be in good standing.

, Like in baseball, you get 3 strikes. The first is a heads up warning you to be careful. If, during your 3 month probation, the YouTube team determines you violated the Community Guidelines a second time, you won’t be able to post new content to YouTube for two weeks. If there are no further issues, full privileges will be restored automatically after the two week period.

Each strike will remain on your account and expire separately three months after it was issued. And finally, if you get a third strike, you're done! YouTube will have no choice but to suspend your account (in other words terminate it) forever.

, If you honestly believe YouTube removed your video by mistake, you will be directed to a form underneath the video in question where you will be asked to provide your side of the story for why you honestly believe YouTube made a mistake in choosing to remove your video for violating the Community Guidelines., Once YouTube receives your appeal, they will look over your appeal very carefully and; after carefully checking the removed video and your appeal, they have one of four ways to email you of your appeal's request.

The first is simple: They apologize for the inconvenience it caused you, remove the strike and reinstate your video.
The second is an option where they can elect to remove the strike from your account; but refuse to reinstate your video.
The third option is they can institute an age restriction on your re-instated video; an option where they determine your video violated no rules but the content isn't appropriate for everyone.
The fourth: YouTube upholds their decision, the video remains down and you can't appeal any strikes for 60 days.

, YouTube's request is simple; they're not looking for the respect most people give to nuns, the elderly, and brain surgeons. All they simply want is for every user; no matter who they are, what they post, etc to keep their videos clean and to stay out of trouble."

Get an idea for your show.,
Choose a title for your show.,
Get lighting or else you wouldn't be able to see anything.,
Make the scene or set look outstanding.,
Have a camera worth taping with and stop recording.,
Select family members or friends to work on your show.,
Make a schedule or a planner of what you will be doing on the show and if there will be some guests.,
Don't be boring or rude in your webshow.,
Practice your lines so you don't forget but don't worry you can have cue cards if you want.,
Edit your video on the computer, make it run cleanly through scenes.,
Distribute your film on a free website.,
Promote your show.,
Read what they think.",How to Make Your Own Webshow," It needs to be a good, wonderful, fun, and exciting with additional episodes. Try to get an idea for one good episode. Think, and write down these steps to help you remember. Then just write the script.;
, Just as much as you need a good idea for your show, you need a good title for it as well. Try to tie your title in with the topic of your show. Not only should it be relevant, it should be distinctive and memorable.

, Pick out some colorful lights, too, if you want to add a little flair and style. Don't forget to give it extra style!

, Pick a colourful, big place to shoot your web show. If you put a plain white blank screen behind you it probably would look boring. If you pick something with a bunch of pictures and add things that show off your own flair. You could also use a large sized printout of an image as a backdrop. When you show your flair don't add too much. It'll overkill it and show you're desperate.

, You'll need a good camera to film your show. You could temporarily use a web cam, but if you want to show quality picture, you should invest in a digital camcorder. But don't worry it's not needed! If you don't have much money you can use your webcam.

, It would be great to have about two to three crew members. One do the actual filming while the other managed other technical aspects. You may also need two to three hosts or actors.

, You can take the ideas you wrote down and fit them into your schedule to remember what time you have to do it.

, If you do, you will probably lose a huge amount of viewers and your precious time of taping shows all goes to waste! You also don't have to be a polite goody two shoes but keep your temper easy too.

, Some people really don't know how to act politely unless they have memorized the script or cue cards fully.

, There are various programs that can help you do this. Add special effects if necessary. Don't let anyone who isn't a good speller or someone who sabotages edit.

, You may want to host your webcast on a video sharing site such as YouTube first, and then if it is really good get your own domain website. Use ratings and comments to your advantage. Listen to what people want to see and what they like.

, Nobody is going to watch your show if they don't know it exists. Use both online and offline methods of spreading the word about your show. This could mean using social media as well as word-of-mouth techniques. Try social networking websites. Tell your friends to tell their friends or relatives. You can even try making posters to hand out.

, Read comments or messages people leave you on your website or video. Don't think your video is bad if some comments are bad, just try to change your show a little bit and spice things up. Pay attention to the viewers that love your show.You should have a place where your fans can go look you up and give you feed back.If you get a lot of feed back that is not so good than just try to change your show a little so your fans will like it more.

Pick a name.,
Choose a regular day to film on.,
Find a common topic and theme for each of your show's episodes.,
Put your ideas onto paper.,
Choose a friend to help you.,
Start your webshow.,
Practice calming yourself, as your first webshow is going to be nerve-racking.,
On the day of the show, turn on the camera and begin.,
Gather an audience.",How to Make a Kids Webshow," Pick your favorite super-hero show or maybe your favorite animal. Or if you can't agree on a name just say: The Bob and Lisa Show. Or mix all of your ideas into one. Missy said Animal show, Carl said Carl Show. Put all together to make: Missy's Animal's on the Carl Show.;
, Every Tuesday or every second Saturday? If you schedule your shows on the same day of the week, they may attract more viewers.

, For at least the pilot (first) episode, you need to have a topic. Examples would be a computer game, comedy, cooking, your thoughts, sports or a different game show per week.

, This is so that people don't get confused. Hand a copy to everyone involved. Also, have something that can help kids remember their lines during the show. Like cue cards. Read How to Memorize Your Lines for more help. Keep in mind, it's also OK to add in little funny things on the spot.

, It doesn't have to be just one. It can be two or three. Humor is at its best when there is more than one person involved.

, Now if you want kids to watch your webshow, make it about something your classmates like, so that it will be popular.

, A good method is focused breathing.

, Follow your script and do your best. Don't worry if you make a mistake. Your audience will probably not notice.

, Now you need to make your audience want to see your next webshow. Talk about the latest things going on, whether it's a song, an item, or clothing. Then it will be a webshow in progress.

Comedy
Talk show
News/Journalism
Music shows
Reality
Soap opera
Live action
How-to's
Random
Drama
Animated series
Anime;
, It should be something memorable, and relevant. Don't copy any other show's name; Make the name of your YouTube web show unique.

, An animation series needs a well-running computer and software, whilst a cameras will be better for talk shows.

, When you are coming up with ideas, make sure each episode has a point to make, and has an interesting plot line so people will want to watch.

, You could do your web show alone or have a crew.


If possible, having a crew is highly recommended. You will need:
Tech-producer(s)
co-Host(s)
The main host, which is you.

,, Gather your web show stars and have a meeting. At the meeting, discuss the following:


Is it a daily, weekly or a monthly web show?
What days is your web show airing?
What kind of web show is it?
When does rehearsal begin?
Do we have the proper things we'll need (See the ""Things You'll Need"" section)
What will our YouTube account be named?
Create a script.
Proofread the script.
Organize any props needed.

, Don't just sit there with white walls in the background. Create an awesome set like in the popular Nickelodeon show iCarly. Make your set unique.

, No one is going to watch your show if they don't know about it. Advertise it in your school, work and on the internet!

, Start planning out unique segments for your web show.

, Rehearse at least two times before you shoot your web show. You might want to use cue cards.

, Have a great time shooting your first webisode. Relax and have fun. If you or any of the stars make a mistake, start over. You can't do a live web show on YouTube so shoot your web show at least one week before you're uploading it on YouTube.

,, Make sure it's under 15 minutes if your account hasn't been verified yet. That's a YouTube rule.

, Shoot more of your web show webisodes and upload it into YouTube every day, week, month and so on. Just make sure to keep an upload schedule so that you aren't early or late.

If you don't have a definitive wall/backdrop, try making one using your surroundings.",How to Clean Up and Redecorate for a Webshow,", Old painting of your grandpa’s grandma or his grandpa? Find a new home for it. Really cool purple chair? Keep it, it will make for some great 'color' on your webshow. Try putting everything in some boxes, and moving them into a corner or another place.

, If this is an unused area, everything will probably be dusty anyway, so if you don’t want to sneeze through your whole show, so dust!

, This way when people see your setting they will wonder, “What is this doing here?”

,,,, If the color isn't right, use whatever color sheet you can find that you like...(much cheaper and less messy than painting).

, Tell the people you know in an e-mail, to visit your site or watch your show on whatever video site you put it on (i.e.-YouTube, Google Video, etc.). Also tell them to e-mail other people the links. Or, you could create an email saying, ""Send this totally cool video to everyone you know!""

, If you are part of a club or a sports team, tell the whole group about what you created. Who knows, maybe they'll take a look at it.

Discard the obvious fakes before proceeding.,
Look at the UFO closely.,
Listen.,
Look at the details surrounding the UFO.,
Consider whether the object reminds you of something.,
Check online for information.,
Use reverse logic.,
Be cynical, suspicious, or at least wary, if:


There are no witnesses, or only the dog or spouse witnessed the event.",How to Tell if a YouTube Video of a UFO Is Fake," These are the UFO videos that are clearly made in elementary school, use Lego men, or state in bold letters (or shout at you), ""This is a joke!"". Assuming you've already put your powers of critical assessment to work at this stage, it's time to proceed to the next signs that a UFO video might not be for real.;
, There are a number of obvious elements that can help you spot the fake UFO video. Here are some things to pay extra careful attention to:.


Can you see any form of attachments to the object that is being claimed as a UFO? For example, strings, wires, stands, etc.
Be aware that invisible thread does wonders and can be very hard to spot unless you are looking for it. Look for glints of light off the invisible thread as the video camera rolls away at different angles, etc.
Is the UFO moving awkwardly, or with a jitter? Wobbliness tends to be a sign of strings and nerves rather than futuristic flying technology. Imagine trying to keep down a cup of alien brew in a wobbly craft? It's probably fair enough to say that if a plane couldn't fly wobbling or teetering in the way that the UFO has been presented as flying, then it's very unlikely the UFO could either - after all, our atmosphere remains the same for the UFO, let alone the comfort needs of the crew.Does the UFO suddenly ""disappear"" without further ado? Do planes, helicopters or hot air balloons just ""disappear""? Not usually. Theoretically, a stealth bomber cloak, 3D cloaking, or meta-material might surround the UFO but if so, why bother to reveal at all and then suddenly disappear? Did it get a whiff of the photographer whose importance was probably considerably less than that of paying attention to either landing properly or keeping the flight path straight? The greater likelihood is that the filming got awkward at that point and just stopped, or the painting tool was put to grand use.

, If there is sound of a UFO in the video, it pays to listen closely as the UFO goes by. How realistic does it sound to you? Or does it remind you of your best friend's attempt at making an alien tune on Garageband late one night?


If the UFO in the video makes noise, it's probably a fake. It is difficult to know but it would be assumed that a UFO in real life would be very careful to keep its noise to a minimum. But more than that supposition, use your hearing senses carefully - a lot of sounds can be synthesized but one person's idea of what a UFO should sound like can easily be very corny (copied from a sci-fi film or show), or just really odd.
If a soundtrack is included, the video has a higher chance of being fake because it's aimed at creating the atmosphere and emotion, making it much more likely that it is staged. If someone really has filmed a UFO, the excitement of it would probably have them uploading it on well before they'd thought to add some spooky soundtrack and turn it into a ""perfect"" video!

, As the familiar adage says, the devil is always in the details.


If the UFO is zooming by some trees, look to see if they blow because of the wind. If they don't, it's fake.
Look for shadows. Are there any shadows of the person taking the video, or other nearby objects? This will indicate to you that the video is shot close by on an object near to the person filming, rather than up in the sky. Moreover, shadows at night are less likely unless a direct source of light is shining on the UFO and it's near enough something to throw a shadow.
Look for reflections. What sort of reflections do you see? Remember the famous nude photos in kettles of eBay sellers - can you see the camera person in the reflection? If so, they're way too close to their miniature model! Other reflections can also be dead giveaways - anything that's meant to be on the ground, such as a car, will indicate a fake if reflecting in the object.
Look for duplicates in the background. For example, look at the trees or power poles as the filmed UFO zooms by. If the trees or power poles present an exact repeating pattern (looping the film), the video is a fake.
Does it appear that the object is tracked by a video camera that just seems to know without a doubt the UFO's next move? Or, does the video operator get tired of this and turn off the camera after only filming a few seconds even though the UFO is still in beautiful view?, If it does, it is a possibly a big giveaway of the ""object"" used to fake the UFO for the filming. Some common objects to be wary of include:


The cloud. A conveniently shaped cloud in suitable weather might fit the bill for a clever photographer.
Kid's toys. Some can be convincing, others definitely less so.

Lights. These really are just too seductive for the amateur fake UFO photographer. From LEDs to bulbs, anything can go, and does.
The saucer. Literally. One kid throws it in the air, while the other one starts filming it.
Beer (or other) bottles. If it reminds you of a bottle flying through the air, trust your instincts. Throwing a beer bottle at a party can give people ideas if there's a video camera handy.
Software clones. Does the object or surrounding objects look just like stuff you've already seen on photo/movie/gaming software?

, Using the claims made in the video, do some online research to verify the claims. Things to look for include:


Dates - do the dates match up with other people's recollections of the siting?
Are there news stories covering the alleged appearance of the UFO?
Is there an article or website debunking your particular video as a clear hoax? For example, there are well-known hoax UFO videos and it's a good idea to discard these from the start before you even get excited about the possibility that your video is real!, A really good way to know how to spot a fake is to know how a fake is made in the first place. Do some research online to find out how a fake UFO video is made.Armed with this knowledge, it becomes a lot easier to spot the tomfoolery on a video featuring an alleged UFO! Some of the more common elements of making a fake UFO video include:


Resorting to the overly familiar saucer shape. While it's commonplace as a UFO representation, did you know that this shape has only been ""popular"" since 1947 and the Roswell incident?Throwing up lights in the background and quickly filming then. This is a very common trick., Be even more concerned if the dog is put forward as a credible witness.
If the video shows a huge object hanging over a very crowded area, such as New York City, but not very many people noticed (remember your research step above here). Other than the ""terrified"" actor in the video, of course. Indeed, the math of anyone looking at a large building in New York City has already been done and it was found that at least 50 people out of the 8 million people in NYC would be staring at a large building every second of the day.Anyone appearing in the video is acting suspiciously, weirdly, or over-the-top.
If the sound is canned or unnatural.It is filmed too well. This could be the indication of a UFO geek who has spent hours poring over the video shoot, getting the colors, shades, and reflections matching perfectly, all because she has seen Fox Mulder point out the illogicality of a UFO photo on an X-Files repeat. The reality is that special effects are affordable to many people to tinker with these days,and if you really did chance on seeing a UFO ""just like that"", it's unlikely that your excited, rushing night-time video would be ""perfect"".
Even the person uploading the video tells you it's a fake project started to help the kids when they got bored one day but it went viral and got distorted into ""being real"" because some UFO enthusiasts (read, people who really, really, really want to see a UFO) happened to be convinced that it ""must"" be real!"

Shoot and edit your video.,
Encode your video for YouTube.,
Upload the video to your channel.,
Add a description.,
Add tags.,
Add annotations.,
Share your video.,
Monetize your videos.,
Upload often.",How to Be on YouTube3," You will get a lot more traction with your videos if you've put a little effort into making them look nice. Keep the following tips in mind when shooting and editing your video:


YouTube videos should have an introduction, especially if they are part of a series, but the intro should be no longer than 10 seconds. You should add a little content first it to catch the attention. The intro should identify you and your channel, as well as the content of the video.Use transitions to good effect. Transitions help move the viewer from scene to scene or to a new topic. A transition helps the viewer follow along as they watch.
Remove unnecessary scenes and mistakes. YouTube isn't live, so you should take the time to remove mistakes and reshoot anything that didn't turn out how you wanted it. Avoid ""uhs"" and ""ummms"". Practicing a script will go along way towards making a good video.

, When you've finished shooting and editing your video, you'll want to encode it properly so that you don't lose any quality when the video is uploaded. There are a variety of programs that can do this, such as Sony Vegas, Avidemux, and Windows Movie Maker.


Videos should be in MP4 format using the H.264 codec for maximum compatibility and highest-quality compression

, Click the Upload button in the upper-right corner of the YouTube page. Make sure that you are signed in with the correct channel when you upload your video.


When uploading a video for everyone to see, make sure that the video is set to Public sharing, so that it can be searched for and found by YouTube visitors.
The uploading and conversion process can take a significant amount of time, especially if you have a slow connection.
You can record directly from your webcam instead of uploading a video, but it is recommended that you record your webcam video in another program that gives you more editing options.

, Every video needs at least a basic description. It should inform the viewer what the general gist of the video is, and how it might relate to them. The description appears next to the video thumbnail when the video shows up in search results.


Avoid copying the title of the video into the Description field. Spend a few minutes coming up with a unique description.

, Tags are single words or short phrases that help to categorize your video. This will help your video appear as a related video when someone is watching a different video. Make sure that your tags are accurate, so that you are drawing in the correct audience. All of your videos should have at least three tags, if not more.


Make sure to tag your video with your own personal brand. This will help your videos appear when your name or brand is searched through Google or YouTube.
Look at other videos in the same category as you and see how they are using tags. Choose tags that are closely related to your video.
Don't forget synonyms.

, These are boxes that appear overlaid on top of your video. They allow you to add text and comments that you may have neglected during filming, add subscription links, or link to a more up-to-date video that you've created on the same topic.


Avoid filling your video with annotations, as this can drive viewers away. Too many annotations make it difficult for the viewer to see the original content.

, Once your video is uploaded, tagged, described, and annotated, it's ready to share with the world. You'll gather some viewers simply through search results, but it can help to advertise your video else. Link to it in your blog, post a link on Facebook or Google+, and let your Twitter followers know that a new video is available. The more eyes that you can reach, the more likely that your video will increase in popularity.

, If you meet certain criteria, you may be eligible to earn money off the views your video gets. This may entail placing an ad at the beginning of your video, and will require creating an AdSense account.

, A good channel gets updated on a regular basis. All of the best YouTube personalities update their channel at least once a week. Many people will upload one major video per week, with smaller videos peppered in between the major releases.


Check out the release schedules for a few of the more popular channels in your niche. This will give you a good idea about how often you should be updating.

, Call or visit the Yahoo Finance website for primary information. A sales associate specialist will guide you through the essential requirements. To advertise on Yahoo Finance, you will need to be prepared to meet certain restrictions, like the type of graphics and verbiage. Only specific words and images deemed appropriate will be allowed.

Do not do any of the following:



Venting, ranting or using hate speech.",How to Not Get Banned from Yahoo! Answers2," Yahoo! Answers isn't a place to vent personal frustrations or rant about issues. It is a community of people with diverse beliefs, opinions, and backgrounds, so please be respectful and keep hateful and incendiary comments off Yahoo! Answers.

Chatting or otherwise violating the question-and-answer format. If you prefer to have discussions or chat with others, please use one of Yahoo!'s other community services, such as Yahoo! Groups or Yahoo! Messenger.

Being mean or obscene. Because patrons as young as 13 may participate in Yahoo! Answers, sexually explicit and vulgar language and images are not welcome on the site. Also not welcome are belligerence, insults, slurs and generally objectionable speech.

Exploiting the community. Yahoo! Answers is a place to gain knowledge, not customers, page views, or dates. If you have years of experience in something, have a special hobby, own your own business, or if you are a knowledge partner, it's OK to accompany a good, on-topic answer with a link to your website, blog, or email to offer more information. However, it is not OK to post links that are unrelated to the topic or are clearly meant only to solicit others for personal and financial gain. Also prohibited are solicitations like ""Will you add me as a contact?"" or propositioning people.

Cheating. The points system is meant to reward the community members for sharing questions and answers, so creating multiple accounts or posting content for the sole purpose of gaining points or soliciting others for points is not permitted. Posting filler answers to a question in an effort to be first to answer, or copying and pasting other members' answers, are also forms of cheating.

Violating the law. Members of Yahoo! Answers are not above the law, so don't post anything that violates the laws of your country, state, province, or city. Don't try to trick people into sharing their personal information, steal anything (like copyright or trademark material), or break into places you shouldn't be. Don't threaten, harass, impersonate, or hurt others, and don't invade other people's privacy.

Maliciously misbehaving. Don't post links to sites that contain viruses or malicious programs or that interfere with the operation of Yahoo! Answers.

Misusing Answers. Don't create multiple accounts to troll or otherwise violate these guidelines or the Yahoo! Terms of Service. Don't post things that are incomprehensible or in the wrong language, and don't post the same question over and over again. The community depends on you to report abuse and rate questions and answers, so using product features such as report abuse and ratings to target others is not allowed.

Doing harm. Be responsible and don’t misrepresent yourself, claim false credentials or expertise or give advice in a way that might cause someone harm. Don’t incite or advocate violence or harmful practices.

If you have that much trouble with spelling, right click on the word with a red squiggle underneath it, and it should have some spelling suggestions. Feel free to use a dictionary facility on the internet, or your the book form.

Unless you only want to use Miku, the Multi Model version is recommended, which you can download here for free. Also, make sure you have some kind of video editor that lets you put music into pictures and stuff like that. (Ex. Windows Live Movie Maker, Windows Movie Maker, Sony Vegas, and etc.);
, Is it a love story? Is it a party? Killing? Randomness? Anything you can think of.

, There are two options:


Make a folder with the series name on it.
Keep the pictures in the MMD folder.

, Unless you're going to use the ones that come with MMD, go to Youtube or MikuMikuBeat. Store models in your downloads and make sure to put all of the other files that come in the folder in the downloads too. There are some people who make MMD models for you to download.

, Store pictures in the ""Backgrounds"" folder which is in the MMD folder, and store stages in the downloads. Now, if you want, get some accessories. Store them in the downloads.

, VOCALOID/Anime songs will be most likely fitting (they are in Japanese, but you may want to learn a little about anime to get the idea on what it's about). You can also find instrumental songs for download, but make sure they are a .wav file. You can turn mp3s into .wavs using Audacity, which you can download here.

, Click on ""Load"" under model manipulation to get out a model. It must be a PMD file. Start moving their bones however you want, to make it look like they are striking a pose, or taking a step, or whatever.

, Now name the picture. Say Ep for episode and pic for picture or p for part. Save it in the series folder you made. For example: Ep 1 pic 5.

, Put a picture in from your folder.

, If you don't want to use captions, you can also use your voice to voice them, but you'll have to make them lip sync between pictures.

,,, If you're satisfied with it click ""Save movie"" and name it like this: MMD Episode . It should be a .WMV file.

, Be sure to delete the .WMV part of it. Also, if you're on Youtube, it will only take 10 minutes unless Youtube give you permission to make videos longer than 10 minutes. Metacafe only accepts 5 minutes.

Every business entity that has operations in the state of Montana must register with the Secretary of State, so you can find the information you need even if the entity actually is organized in a different state.;
, Using the correct spelling of the full name will narrow your results, while using a partial name or only the first few letters will return broader results.


Use only letters. If the business name contains commas, apostrophes, or other punctuation, simply leave them out. If the business name contains an ""&,"" such as ""Smith & Sons,"" change it to the word ""and."" You can leave out any other special characters as the online lookup will ignore them anyway.If the business registered within the last 10 days, it might not show up in your search., Your search produces a list of results for you to choose from.


The initial results include a list of names that match the letters or words you entered. Next to each name you also can see the entity type, city, and status.
Clicking on the entity name shows the entity's full address, registered number, the date the entity was created, and contact information for the entity's registered agent., If the entity has an active and current registration, you can print an official certificate for $5.


Certificates of existence are issued to Montana corporations or LLCs in good standing with the Secretary of State. The certificate includes the name of the corporation or LLC, the date of its incorporation or organization, and whether all the taxes, fees, or penalties owed to Montana have been paid.
Certificates of authorization are issued to corporations or LLCs that were formed in another state. This certificate tells you when it was issued, the name of the corporation or LLC, and whether it has paid all the taxes, fees, or penalties it owes to the state of Montana.
You also have the option of downloading a Certificate of Fact for $15. These certificates are issued on request for assumed names, trademarks, limited partnerships, or limited liability partnerships. They also might be issued to a corporation or LLC if they want more information registered than would be listed on a certificate of existence or certificate of authorization., The Montana Secretary of State also gives you the option of viewing the directors, officers, managers, members and partners associated with a specific business at a cost of $2 per search.

Larger companies also routinely make their annual reports available to financial reporters and journalists, so a search of financial news websites and magazines may bring up additional information, including analyses or summaries.You also may be able to use free websites such as annualreports.com, which provides a searchable listing of corporate annual reports that are available on the internet., If the company is required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, you can find those by searching EDGAR.


All publicly traded companies must file regular financial reports with the SEC, which are collected in the commission's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system. This includes the company's 10-K annual reports, 10-Q quarterly reports, and other forms that may contain important financial data.You can search EDGAR on the SEC's website,but the search tools there aren't very sophisticated. There are some more user-friendly sites that allow you to search SEC filings, but you'll have to pay a subscription fee for access., You can search for the name of a Montana business entity on the BBB website to learn more about its customer service reputation.


The BBB sets standards for and evaluates business behavior, resolving complaints and helping consumers identify trustworthy businesses.You also can check the business's BBB rating, which the bureau issues based on information such as the business's complaint history, its commitments to the BBB, and any licensing or government actions known to the BBB., Several companies such as Hoover's, Dun & Bradstreet, and Bloomberg Intelligence research and analyze the financial health of companies and issue detailed reports.


Hoover's reports range from a brief company report for less than $100 that gives you basic overall information about the business to credit reports and in-depth data analysis reports for several hundred dollars.Dun & Bradstreet is one of the most common sources for researching private companies.It provides credit reports as well as tools and resources to assist you in making business or investment decisions involving the company, which you can purchase either on a one-time basis or by starting a subscription.The Dun & Bradstreet report can help you learn about the positive values of doing business with the company you've looked up, as well as the potential risks.A subscription to Bloomberg Intelligence gains you access to Bloomberg Finance's research arm, specializes on in-depth analysis of industry, government, economic, and litigation factors spanning more than 130 global industries., If there's a business journal in the city where the Montana business is headquartered or has a store, there might be articles there. You can also check any local Chamber of Commerce or other business association where the entity's owners may be members.Depending on the industry, trade publications also might provide some information about the company. Many of these publications have websites, though they may not offer all of their archives for free or have a searchable database."

Use Ethernet to get a computer online.,

Turn off competing devices.,
Contact your ISP.",How to Improve Video Streaming1," A wired connection is usually faster than WiFi. Try connecting your computer to the router with an Ethernet cable and you may notice improvements.


This option is not usually available for mobile devices.;
, If you cannot use ethernet, connect to a WiFi signal, as this is much faster than a standard mobile phone's data connection. Move to the same room as the wireless router, or purchase a WiFi range extender to boost the signal across your home.


See the section on optimizing your router below to further maximize your WiFi signal.

, If you are on a network sharing an Internet connection, disconnect all devices from the network while they are not in use. Additional computers and mobile devices can slow down a video stream considerably.

, Call your Internet Service Provider and ask them to analyze your connection for potential problems. Sometimes, the provider can fix an issue on its end that was slowing down your internet. If you have exceeded your data cap for the month, your ISP may be ""throttling"" your connection, making it much slower until the next billing cycle.


Upgrading your internet service package is also an option, or switching to a different ISP.

, On Windows, open ""Task Manager"" by pressing Ctrl Alt Delete. On Mac, go to Applications → Utilities → Activity Monitor. Either way, look at the list of processes and decide which ones to close carefully, following these guidelines:


If you recognize the name of an application, and are not using it, stop it by clicking End Process or Quit Process.
If you don't recognize the name of a process, leave it alone. If unfamiliar processes are using a large amount of ""Memory"" or ""%CPU,"" try restarting your computer or scanning for viruses.

, Some malicious viruses force your computer to use its processing power for another person. Download antivirus software if you do not have any installed, and scan your computer for viruses using that software.

, Turning off hardware acceleration will allow your video playback application to set the resource requirements, instead of using your computer’s predefined settings. This is a good idea if your computer struggles to handle modern websites and videos, but is not necessary on more powerful devices.


On a Windows computer, click this link and follow the instructions that match your operating system.
On a Mac, disable this setting on the Flash player or other video player by right-clicking, command-clicking, or ""two-finger clicking"" the video itself to bring up the options menu.

Access your router settings.,
Log in to your router settings.,
Turn on QoS or WMM.,
Try enabling Burst ACK if possible.,
Upgrade your router.",How to Improve Video Streaming3," Access your wireless router settings by typing in your router's IP address, listed here for most common router brands.

, Enter the username and password you selected for your router, or the default password for your brand of router. Once you have accessed the settings, continue reading to optimize your network for video streaming.

, Each company that makes routers organizes its settings a little differently. You may find a link directly to ""QoS"" or ""Quality of Service,"" or you may need to click through other menus until you notice a QoS setting. Turn this setting to ""On"" to prioritize video streaming and other high-intensity network usage. On some newer routers, you can turn on the ""WMM"" setting instead for a similar result.Select ""Downstream QoS"" on a Netgear router, not ""Upstream QoS.""If you do not notice a change, the bottleneck slowing your network down is likely your Internet Service Provider., If your router has ACK settings, they are likely in the same menu as the QoS settings. Changing your ACK setting to ""Burst ACK"" may increase your video streaming speed, but it can cause dropped connections, shorter range, or other problems over some connections. Take note of the default setting (typically ""Immediate ACK"") so you can reverse this change if you notice these problems.

, If your wireless router is old, replacing it with a newer model may be a good idea. For best results, purchase a router with the 802.11n standard (and not ""802.11n draft"") for the best signal, or the newer 802.11ac standard.Check that the router's results match its advertising by visiting the WiFi Alliance website and searching for the product name in the upper right search bar. If the product is listed, it has been certified.

Search for the free web host that fits your needs.,
Sign up with your new web host.,
Choose your domain name.,
Build your website.",How to Get a Free Web Site1," There are a few companies that offer web free hosting services and make it easy to quickly set up a simple website with your own personalized content. The tradeoff for this is typically a custom subdomain (containing the company's name) and significantly limited options for the look and feel of the site. Yola, Google Sites, Freehostia, and Biz.nf all offer some basic website design and hosting options for free. If you plan to post continuously or wish to have a site with a greater number of distinct pages (e.g. a blog), options like Tumblr, Blogger, or Wordpress may be a better fit. They offer more limitations on the look of your free web site but little to no restriction on the overall size.
Shop around before you choose. Different web hosts offer different features and all will limit the options in their free packages. Consider the features that matter most to you before signing up.
Free web hosting usually lacks a data backup plan so be extra careful about backing up your files.;
, Most services will require an email address and other verifiable identity information to get started. Some may require credit card information as well if payment is to be invoked automatically based on your specific usage, but this should be rare.


If you have a Google account already, signing up for Google Sites or Blogger will be as easy as signing in and then navigating to the correct page.

, Many (but not all) free web hosts also supply free domain names or subdomain names (URLs containing the company's name). Typically you will be prompted to determine a URL shortly after signing up and will first have to check for it's availability.


Choose your domain name carefully. While some hosts may allow for changes to your custom domain name in the future (subject to availability and typically adjustable through your profile settings) others may not.

, Free website hosts may not let you use fully customize the look and feel of your website but instead offer pre-made themes with customizable options. For many this can be a blessing, as these templates and tools allow for the easy creation of an attractive and professional-looking website.


You should be able to browse available templates and sample websites before signing up for a given service.

Research free domain name registrars.,
Choose a domain name registrar.,
Search for your desired domain names.,
Select your domain name from those available.",How to Get a Free Web Site2," If all you need is a free domain name (e.g. if your website is already built, or if you'd like to build it yourself from scratch), then this is a good option for you. A quick search can yield several results of companies that supply free domains.


Free and fully customized domain names that end in “.com” and “.org” are nearly impossible to get, but there are sites that offer free domains with less common extensions such as “.tk” or “.cf”.
Web hosts sometimes offer fully free domains as incentive for you to purchase a hosting package.
Note that many free hosting sites offer free subdomains of their websites (e.g. yourcustomname.freehostingcompany.com). If you are willing to have your web hosting company's name in front of your chosen domain name for at least a time, this may still be your best option.
There are also some companies that offer affiliate programs challenging you to sell domains to others in exchange for a free one for yourself., Consider what features and functions you most need from your domain name registrar and on your hopes and dreams for the site itself before settling on any one provider.

, Because alternate domain extensions are relatively rare, your first choice domain name is more likely to be available through free domain provider services. Before being assigned your domain you will have to search its availability.


If having a specific domain name is important to you, consider checking the availability of a given domain before signing up for any services by typing it into your browser's address bar. If a website is returned (instead of an error), you will know in advance that this specific domain is already taken.

, Some sites only offer one domain extension option (e.g. "".tk"" or "".tumblr.com""), while others will search through all available (free) domain extension options. Choose the domain name one that suits your fancy, and you’re ready to start building your website.


Free domain providers typically make it easy to redirect your existing website to the new domain, or offer a range of options to help you begin building your website. *Remember to be careful, the Dot TK is not trustworthy due to they redirect the URL traffic to malware when your website has got good enough traffic. There is evidence of people getting their hard work disconnected.*

For session hijacking, look for mismanagement and exploitation of session (variable protocol), token or cookies.,
Look for ""Vertical Privilege Escalation"".,
Similar to all other software, web application also suffers from unvalidated input and improper error handling.,
Random feeding server-side script (ie.",How to Discover Web Application Vulnerabilities," It frequently applies to both network layer (OSI Model Layer 3) and application layer (OSI Model Layer 7). The attack targeting at application layer generally involves session fixation, session side-jacking, cross site scripting, and the attempts to change log in cookie or unique session id. URL manipulation however, involves the modification of uniform resource locator's properties. These could be on parameters, unique ids, server/referral path, protocols, port numbers, or even directly on the link address itself...
Often, the web servers had been mis configured (broken access list i.e. .htaccess) by inexperienced administrators to allow users perform stuffs that are supposedly out of their permissions. The web server properties must be regularly audited to prevent any possible intrusion.


For instance, once the intruders logged into a bank account, he could change his unique id to somebody else's, this situation is particularly possible if the URL string contains some predictable character pattern such as order of numbering.


http://www.bank.com/aspx/Main.aspx?function=TransactionDetails&account_no=5204320422040006 to become (notice the last digit ""6"" becomes 7"") http://www.bank.com/aspx/Main.aspx?function=TransactionDetails&account_no=5204320422040007

Note the above method could be largely empowered to harvest all existing user accounts if fuzzing technique is applied. Tools that are good for web application fuzzing are WebScarab, Spike, Peach and a few others.

;
, Apart from numbering approach, intruders could perform crawling against hidden directory once they are logged in to account. There is a technique called ""Vertical Privilege Escalation"" where intruders altering the hidden directory parameter to access admin rights, once they had logged into system with normal user account.

, Buffer overflows, cross site scripting, and blind or non-blind SQL injection are among the most common attacks against poorly engineered input mechanism.

, cgi) is also a type input attack but with purpose to cause error rebounce in order to gather more information that could be used for web exploitation (i.e.) PATTERN: ""..../page.php?something=...""


Note with the example above, the intruders do not expect any ""luck"" to accidentally access the administrator directory by randomly altering the parameter with a list of possible strings (characterized fuzzing could do this as well). Instead, they expected to see the error message re-bounce, which could provide them more information regarding internal architecture, particular on database. Many websites that requested authentication to access protected pages did not actually encrypt their traffic, this had led to possibility of sniffing (in plain text), spoofing and men-in-the-middle attack. Even so, many websites applied SSL only on certain authenticated webpage, but after authentication the web traffic fall back to unencrypted state again, thus allowing session hijacking because the cookie value and session id could be sniffed and spoofed. The hidden values in source codes such as 'ViewState' as hidden form field could be reviewed at client side with tools such as 'viewstatepeeker', which could track the changes to a website during post backs.

Open a Google Adwords account.,
Create first AdWords campaign.,
Build your keyword list.,
Make final settings and start campaign.,
Set up a campaign using Google's location targeting option.,
Set up a second campaign using Google's local targeting, to cover all your options.,
Maintain your campaigns.",How to Create Pay Per Click (PPC) Ad Campaigns for a Local Business," Go to https://www.google.com/ads/ and click on Google AdWords link and click Sign Up Now. Follow the presented steps to open account.;
, The key to getting clicks at a very low cost is setting up your keyword lists and location settings correctly. You will need 2 campaigns; one local, one national. We will setup the national campaign in this step. Login to your AdWords account and click ""Create new AdWords campaign"". On this first page you should be able to use the default settings for Name, Language=English, and Target=""Global or nationwide"", but you will need to enter an Ad Group Name. you start and then work up a short, catchy ad.

, This step is the key to getting targeted, low cost leads. First you need to make a base list of keywords that people would use to find a business like yours. For example, a Chinese Restaurant would use terms like: Chinese, Chinese food, Chinese delivery, etc. At this point put in as many words and terms as you can think of, you can always remove keywords later. Next you need to localize the list by making a list of locations your business serves and combine the two lists. The final list should contain all possible combinations of the two lists. This can be an enormous task, but there is a great tool that makes this very easy. Go to http://5minutesite.com/local_keywords.php and enter your Zip Code, the Radius of your customer area and enter your base keyword list into the ""Enter one keyword or phrase per line"" box. Scroll down, click Submit and the page that comes back will have a localized list ready for you to copy in to the AdWords keywords box.

, With a localized list, you can set a maximum cost-per-click (CPC) of $.05 and $.10; use a setting you feel comfortable with paying to get a potential customer. Set you daily budget to $1 - $2 a day or any amount you can afford. Now Save Campaign to finalize your settings.

, Google attempts to locate users based on their Internet address. Due to a number of technical issues beyond the scope of this How-To, Google often can not locate a user, and as result, will only show them ads from the the national ad pool. This is why we setup the national campaign first; it will be made available to larger audience of users.

, Login to your AdWords account and click ""Create new AdWords campaign"" and follow the same steps used to create the national campaign with two exceptions: In the section ""Target customers by location"" select either ""Target customers by regions / cities"" or ""Target customers in a circular area around your location"" and enter your location and service area. The other exception is you will use a keyword list without location terms added to it; just use the base keyword list you used in the national campaign before location terms were added.

, Login from time to time and see which keywords are doing well, add any new keywords you think of and remove terms that have a high cost per click that you feel are not resulting in new customers.

Use your Tagxedo creations for personal use with proper attribution.",How to Create a Word Cloud at Tagxedo.Com," No other browsers have Silverlight support as of spring 2017.Firefox ESR will retain Silverlight support into early 2018. You will need to take steps to prevent Firefox 51 from automatically updating to the current version.

If you already use Firefox, you can have multiple versions of Firefox on your computer, but you will also need to make sure you don't accidentally overwrite one version with another when doing installations. You can rename Firefox versions or install them in separate folders to prevent accidental overwriting.
If you're using multiple Firefox versions, you can also use Firefox's Profile Manager to create a separate profile for use only by Firefox 51.If you use a separate profile for Firefox 51, you can prevent automatic updating of Firefox 51 while maintaining auto-updating of your current version of Firefox.
Mozilla doesn't recommend downgrading to Firefox 51 because it will become increasingly less secure, so you should restrict using Firefox 51 to ""safe"" sites that need an NPAPI plugin such as Silverlight.More information about using Firefox 51 or ESR at websites requiring plugins such as Silverlight or Java may be found at How to Use Firefox ESR or Firefox 51 to Access Websites Requiring Silverlight or Java.;
, Once on the website, find the button on the left side of the screen that says ""Create"" and click that.









, If Silverlight is properly installed and you are using Firefox 51 or lower or Internet Explorer, a sample blue word cloud in the ""Tagxedo Creator"" default ""South America"" shape will appear.









, This brings up a box where you will type in your own words into the area labeled ""Enter Text"". Click ""Submit"" once the text you want is entered. Your words will appear in the default blue ""South America"" shape.









, The respin icons (round arrows) randomly change your choices of color scheme, font and orientation. You have two color respin options.

Choose a theme. Themes are color schemes.
""Color"" changes the colors of words without changing the theme.







,, This option is on the toolbar under respins. Orientation can be random, horizontal, or vertical.









, Shapes can add meaning to the words which you entered into the word cloud. You are able to select an image from the list provided or add your own image.

To add your own image

Find or create a black on white .jpg and save it to your computer - the jpg does not have to be very high resolution. By default, Tagxedo's image editor will put words in the black part of your jpg.
Choose ""Add Image"" from the ""Shape"" options dialog box. When prompted, upload the black on white jpg from your computer.
In the resulting dialog box many tiny copies of the word ""Tagxedo"" will appear in the area where your word cloud words will show up. Slide the threshold slider to the right if you need to sharpen the borders of your custom shape. Don't slide the threshold slider too far to the right or you will lose your custom shape altogether
Click ""Accept"" when you see ""Tagxedo"" in the right places
Your custom shape will be available (in red) from the Tagxedo shapes menu




















, More information about the many Tagxedo options can be found on the internet and at the Tagxedo blog and FAQ. A few possibilities:

If you want to make words that appear frequently in your list bigger, increase ""Emphasis"" under Word|Layout Options>Layout
To keep words in a phrase together, use a tilde, e.g., WikiHow~Rocks!
To make words fill the space around your shape rather than fill the shape's interior, click the ""Shape"" disclosure triangle under the options section of the toolbar. The ""Invert"" button on the bottom right (to the right of the ""Classic Cloud"" buttons) will do what it implies, put words around all the shapes in the menu, including custom shapes that you have uploaded. Click the inverted shape of your choice. Uploading a jpg with a white custom shape on a black background will also work and will give you better control over the size of your background.










If you want to make an image with a transparent background, decrease ""Background Opacity"" to 0 under Word|Layout Options>Advanced and save your image in .png format
If you need to include numbers and punctuation, make those changes under Word|Layout Options>Word
If you want to assign a specific color, orientation or font to a particular word, follow the directions on the Tagxedo blog post of July 10, 2010, ""Customizing Individual Words -- Color, Angle, and Font""









, When you have finished, select ""save"" which is located near the top of the left-sided toolbar. You now have the option to save to your computer in .jpg or .png formats of various sizes or post to one of your social media accounts.

Basic options. Decide if you'd like your guests to be able to invite other people and to add their photos to the event page.







Create an online-only hangout. Google Plus allows you to create Google Plus Hangouts as events -- so it's an online-only gathering between you and your friends. Under the advanced options, select ""Google+ Hangout.""







Make the event public. By default, Google Plus Events are only visible to those invited, but you can change it to be a public event under the advanced menu.







Add additional fields to your event. If you'd like to add a website, ticket seller URL, YouTube link, transit/parking information, or other details to your event information, check the ""Show additional fields"" option.

, Click on the red ""Add Photos"" button near the top of the event page, and find a relevant photo on your computer. Uploaded photos will appear in the event wall.


Google Plus also automatically creates a new album for all of the photos you upload to an event. That way, you can access these photos from your albums page and from the event page.
While other social networking sites force you to flip through each person's albums to find photos from a particular event, Google Plus has organized everything by event and by person, minimizing the annoyance of not being able to locate a specific photo.

If this is a yearly-recurring event or a regular gathering between a group of people, you can post pictures from the last time a similar event happened. Otherwise, it might be better to post photos from the event after the gathering has taken place.

, A blue box will appear above the event title to link you to the full-screen slideshow.


You can also share photos and videos to the event in real time with Party Mode on the Android app. Turn on Party Mode when you get to an event, and any photos and videos you take there can instantly be shared with everyone at the event.

, Posting the event to your profile may make it visible to people outside of the guest list, depending on which circles or individuals you choose to share the post with. This may be a good idea after the event has happened so you can share photos from the event to your circles.
, On the main Google Plus Events page, you'll find a link on the right-hand menu to view your Google Calendar. All Google Plus events that you have created and RSVPed to are automatically added to your calendar with any the existing Google Calendar content.

Hang Christmas lights.,
Use garish and unconventional furniture in your room.",How to Become a Tumblr Boy," This is obvious; how are you going to be a Tumblr boy if you don’t have access to the right materials? You won’t. Easy answer. Sign up as follows:


Go to the main page of the Tumblr website. Click the sign-up button. This will redirect you to another screen with the email and password requirements, just like on every other site you visit.
Enter a legit email address, and choose a unique URL. Try to pick a name that someone would be more likely to remember; don’t go and use a bunch of symbols – people won’t remember that. If it’s possible, pick something that is derived from another language, or is a play on words in your own. That way, it will be intriguing to other people, and they will be more inclined to inquire about it. Don’t worry though – if you think it’s crappy, you can always change it later.;
, There will be a myriad of themes thrown at you at first; if you are overwhelmed, pick a basic one for now – as above, you can always change it later. Pick a theme that correlates with your own interests; if that means you have to make your own from scratch (although that takes skill in coding), so be it. This is an extra terrific idea, since if your blog catches on, people can request to use your theme.

, The most used and cliché thing you can hear about Tumblr is “make your posts unique!” Even though it’s not very unique to make them unique anymore, it’s still important. Even if you are trying to show off for other people, you are still the one making the posts and uploading the content. If all you do is repost, then not only will that tarnish your blogging rep, you’ll be as bland as a banana – and people will look right through that. As the wise How to Be Tumblr Famous puts it:  “You can make original text posts. This means writing meta about television shows or books, if that's your niche, or dissecting bad literature. It means putting your opinions and your ideas out there for people to see. That may seem scary, but, even if people don't agree with your ideas, they'll still be engaging you and then other people will see and be intrigued.”

, With the amazing feature of the queue, you can post even when you’re not around. Posting new, fresh, and original content is a must, no matter if you’re a scientist or a sociologist.

, Taking care of your body will become a breeze if you follow this simple rule. Chugging a one-liter of Coke and downing 25 pizza rolls after school every day won’t help you on your road to Tuml-boydom. Having a lean it fit body is essential.

, That means taking a shower every day, plus washing your face after school – especially if you are acne prone. Tumblr boys usually are devoid of acne, so get that treated first thing. There are so many products out there that there should be no reason for you to suffer through it.

, As there are so many products out there to help this, it’s unnecessary to sit and suffer through it. Here are some tips to help you out:


Wash your face twice a day with a cleanser. Force yourself to wash your face with a mild cleanser twice a day – no matter how you feel. This will be the first step in diminishing acne, and you’ll be able to see results.
Exfoliate your skin. Most guys seem to think things like these are for sissies – and they’re right -- about sissies that have great skin! This is imperative that you do – exfoliation is next to cleanliness, you know. A mild exfoliate works to slough off your dead skin cells that conglomerate on the surface of your skin. There are many homemade solutions, as well as bought.
Use products with benzoyl peroxide. Don’t waste your money on the more expensive brands like Proactiv – you can get the same result from going to your local drugstore and picking up a bottle of benzoyl peroxide for less than a fifth of the cost.Look for crèmes or lotions that contain 3% or less of benzoyl peroxide.Don’t forget the toner and the moisturizer. Use the toner after you cleanse, and the moisturizer after you’ve put everything on. Your skin will thank you!

, Many a boy exists who is too tired or lazy to take the time to do this. Don’t be a victim of the Tragedy of the Commons. Secure your future molars now with an insurance policy of two minutes in the bathroom.

, Get enough protein, gain some weight, and work out. To be a Tumblr boy, you need to have muscles. Failing that, abs. If you’re scrawny, buckle down, eat more and gain weight. Here is a great article on this.

,


First up: hair. If he is black, it is usually shaven with only a little hair left; that usually looks best. If he is white, and doesn’t have über-curly hair, then he can do a lot. Many Tumblr boys do a faux-hawk, while others have a tousled look. Do what looks best to you; if you think bedhead is cool, go for it. Just make sure you have your Obey snap-back on.
Face. His face is usually devoid of acne. Though, there are some that can own up to their acne (especially if they’ve had hard struggles with it) and make it their own – a signature of them. If you can do that – and pull it off – kudos to you. The earring of choice, if you do choose to wear one, is faux diamond.
Shirt. Usually something ironic, hipster, or sport-related. Graphic sweatshirts are good, along with anything Hurley. Obey is fine, and tanks tops are a must. So are tacky sweaters and anything plaid. Hoodies are good, too.
Pants. Skinny jeans are a staple, as are white skinny jeans. Sweatpants, if worn correctly, are an option, as are slim khakis.
Shoes. Nike, Jordans, and Vans are the most popular. Any shoe will work really – no one will be seeing much of them anyway.

, Now that you walk the walk and talk the talk, you might want to post the post. That means, if you’re gonna start acting like a Tumblr boy, an official rule is to take oodles of selfies per day in your room. But you can’t do that if you don’t have the proper accommodations!

, Take photos from your adventures and escapades and print them and put them on your wall. That is one “strangely specific” aspect of Tumblr rooms that can be pin-pointed. This includes wall-murals, and “inspirational quotes.”

, Not only will this make your room cozier, it will look cooler, as well. Get creative––you don’t have to use Christmas lights if you don’t want to; there are many other options to choose from: LED, lava lamps, track lighting, and so forth.

, Because it clashes so horrible with your room, it is bound to make an impression.

Develop a Twitter personality.,
Start following people who are in your profession, or are in the demographic you are trying to reach.,
Go to Summize.com to see who is talking about your industry or topics.,
Create a mixture of your new content and other types of content.,
Finesse the way you post your content.,
Cross-promote with Twitter.,
Ask for fans to recommend you, occasionally.",How to Use Twitter to Promote Your Content," Before you start setting up links to your own content, your users need to understand who you are in your bio, and what your main topics of interest are. Begin posting photos, links to news articles, thoughts about your profession on daily tweets for a few weeks, before asking for followers.


Make sure your profile is set to ""public."" This means people do not have to ask for permission to see your content and follow you. You want people to see, read and recommend your content freely.
Remember to include your website in the bio section, and in 1 of your first few tweets. You should refrain from posting it every day, but you should give people access to it, in case they are researching you on their own.;
, Most people receive alerts when someone new is following them. They may look at your site and decide to follow you in return.


Do not make the mistake of following 1,000 people the first week. Many people use directories like Twellow.com to find people who fit in their demographic, and then they try to follow everyone at once. This looks like a sales tactic. In the end, you will get repeat users to your content if people recommend you on Follow Friday or re tweet your content.

, This Twitter directory can help you stay on top of the newest trends, so that you are posting things that are relevant to that day's topics. Twitter is constantly being updated, so it pays to spend the time getting to know what topics are hot.

, If you are simply posting your blog entries every day or your products, you are giving the impression that you are selling, not that you are part of a conversation with potential clients or readers. Try posting some of the following things as well as your own content:


Post links to educational articles or share your expertise. Helpful educational articles about your newest article topic, or up-to-date professional training articles show that you are helpful and interested in sharing your knowledge with the community.
Ask questions in your Twitter posts. Try to start meaningful discussions about big news topics and reply to your friends and followers who answer.
Re tweet other peoples' content. An occasional sharing of content that you like creates goodwill with your followers. It also shows your personality, by what you choose to be important enough to re tweet. Telling other people about smart, interesting people won't necessarily divert attention, but make you part of the conversation.
Engage in Follow Fridays, with the hash-tag #ff or #followfriday. Recommend people who you think have similar interests, or who enrich your Twitter conversations.

, Sometimes customized tweets and attention to detail make all the difference to your followers. The following ways can be used to creatively post your content:


Post links to the ""Comments"" section of your blog or website. If users have started an interesting discussion, keep it going on Twitter. Ask Twitter users to respond on your website, if they have something to add.
Brand yourself with regular Twitter-based promotions, lists or content. Give users a reason to check back every Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. Many bloggers create trends by starting a weekly ritual of posting content. This can be anything from a website coupon to a list of the 10 best articles of the week. The more creative, the better.
Create your own hash-tags for events or successful trends. When a good number of people start commenting on your trend, then it's time to brand it. Make it short but memorable, such as ""#10best."" If possible, include part of your website name in the hash-tag.
Advertise Twitter-only content. If you are spending the time personalizing your Tweets, then let your followers know that every week you feed them something tailored to them.

, Post Twitter badges on your website, printed materials, email blasts and more. Some people may not know you are on Twitter, and an invitation through 1 of these channels may help them to look at your content more often.

, Many people ask for re tweets, Stumbles (for StumbleUpon) or a suggestion to friends. Be careful not to overdo it and it may show how much brand loyalty you have created.

Go to Tumblr to sign up for an account.,
Get to know the seven different types of posts.,
Follow people and get your own followers.,
Like and reblog.,
Understand messages.,
Queuing and drafts.,
Customize your Tumblr.,
Post your own original content.",How to Use Tumblr," You will need to choose a username, which will act as your display name on the Tumblr dashboard, as well as part of the URL of your blog (""yourusername"" dot tumblr dot com). Your username is not permanent, however; you may change it at any time by going to your blog settings.;
, These types are varied to allow your best approaches to be put forward; you may even like to try each style over time. The seven types of posts are as follows:



Text. A text post consists of plain text. Images, hyperlinks, videos, and some HTML-based widgets can be added. The raw HTML of the post can be edited.

Photo. A photo post consists of a single image accompanied by a brief description. Photos can be uploaded from your PC, or you can use the URL of an image already on the web.

Quote. A quote post consists of title text (the quote) and a single line of body text (citing the origin of the quote).

Link. A link post consists entirely of a single piece of descriptive text, which is linked to the website or webpage being described.

Chat. A chat post is used to share a snippet of conversation.

Audio. An audio post consists of a single .mp3 file (be it a music track, podcast, etc.), which can be played via a Flash music player. Only one audio post is permitted daily.

Video. A video post consists of an embedded video, which can be uploaded from your PC or imported from websites such as YouTube or Vimeo.

, Followers are fellow Tumblr users who subscribe to your blog. Whatever you post will appear on their dashboard. When you follow other Tumblr users, their posts will then appear on your dashboard. If a person you don't want following you does so, you can block them. The more followers you get, the more chance you have of getting your posts reblogged and liked.

, If someone likes your post so much that they want to share it, they can reblog it. If someone reblogs one of your posts, their followers will see it on their dashboards. If someone doesn't want to reblog your post, they can 'like' your post. You can reblog and like the posts of others. All posts are rated with the ""notes"" they get. With each 'reblog' and 'like,' the posts increment one note.

, If you allow access to your Ask box, you can receive questions from anyone who uses Tumblr, as well as anonymous visitors. Your answers to these questions will be posted to your blog, for all of your followers and visitors to see. You can also send fan mail, which is similar to asking or submitting something to someone, but more focused on giving positive comments to another person about their blog.

, If you wish to publish a string of posts while you're offline, you can add the posts to your queue and choose at which intervals of time they'll be published (for example, every 15 minutes). Alternatively, you can appoint a certain time at which the posts are published, including date and time. These features are helpful if you're going on holiday and still want to blog, but won't have an Internet connection during your vacation. Drafts, meanwhile, allow you to save a post online; you can then finish the post when you next log onto Tumblr and publish it whenever you wish.

, The Customize page gives you access to all of the under-the-hood settings for your blog and is split into several sections.



Info. Choose the title of your blog, alter the sidebar description, select an avatar image, and change your username/URL.

Theme. Select from a range of pre-made themes for your blog. Alternatively, create your own HTML code, to completely personalize your blog.

Appearance. Change your background/header image, tagline, etc. Some themes allow room for advanced features like a list of your favorite posts or who you're following.

Pages. Add/delete/edit web pages on your blog. Creating an About page or an FAQ page is common practice among Tumblr users.

Services. Use this pane to hook your blog up to other websites like Facebook and Twitter.

Community. Change privacy settings for your Ask box and set up a user submissions page.

Advanced. This is where you'll find any other options, including time zone selection, custom CSS, and how many posts you wish to display per page on your blog.

, To optimize the quality of your posts, ensure that text is well-written, images are relevant, and you keep to the theme of your blog, if you have one. The most popular Tumblr users are those who dedicate their blogs to a certain purpose. Add relevant tags to your posts, so that users searching for a certain topic are more likely to stumble upon your blog. It's also a good idea to cite the sources of things you did not write/create, or you'll be accused of plagiarizing. To protect yourself from plagiarism, type the URL of your own blog in the 'Source' box on the sidebar of the post composition page. Ensure that your material is interesting, and post at least once a day, or your followers will get bored with your inactivity and may even unfollow you.

No matter how ""safe"" the website says it is, think about all that could go wrong. It may not be worth the risk. Even if you don't think it's a risk, there is even more to consider with ""Locational Privacy"" that users happily sign away with ""Accept"" buttons. Electronic Frontier Foundation's ""Locational Privacy..."" paper may help you feel better being not-so-connected, and may remind you why being offline may be a breath of fresh air.

, Recently, Facebook and Myspace have had a fire sale on all of their user's personal information, providing marketing firms and third-parties not only with information they requested, but also gave away information the marketers didn't even ask for. They have a history of selling user information through violating your privacy, have done so in the past, and it shouldn't surprise you to hear more stories of it as well in the future. (In case you're wondering, now may be a good time to go back to Facebook and Myspace... really. Go back to them and ensure that you have deleted your account and not merely ""deactivated"" it.)

, If you all are out at the mall, none of you will be online. You will actually be interacting. Go to games, dances, invite kids over to your house, go to parties, hang out on the street like in the old days. And actually doesn't it feel better to see people in real life anyway?

, It's distracting. It's easy for ""five minutes"" to turn into an hour and a half, and if you're already a procrastinator, that's not a good thing. Concentrate on things that matter. That term paper that's due Wednesday, perhaps?

Think about why you are constantly using the internet or social media.,
Consider your mental or emotional health that is at play as a result of too much social media use.,
Write down the dates and times you turn on your computer, other device, or when you log onto a website.,
Seek as much help as needed, whether it is from a close relative/friend, or even from a professional.,
Identify the common websites and forms of social media you use.,
Turn off cell phone and site notifications (Facebook notifications, email, etc).,
Get rid of counterproductive accounts (eg: Deactivate Facebook account, delete Snapchat, etc).,
Set timeframes for internet and social media use (time yourself, set a timer, download website blocking applications, etc).,
Go out and find something else to do.",How to Limit Social Media and Internet Use," Are you bored? Is it for fun? Try to identify with whatever the reasoning may be.;
, Constant use of social media can cause psychological stress along with negative feelings of depression or jealousy of those around you.

, If you have tried all you can and still cannot change your habits, talk to someone about your problem. It’s better to deal with these things at first hand.

, Start from most visited to least. Usually there are a couple sites you visit more often than others. For example, you might be more interested in your friends’ photos on Facebook rather than what they are talking about on Twitter.

, Notifications always pop up, and always tempt you to go through a certain application on site for hours on end. The best idea would be to delete, ignore, or turn them off all together.

, Getting rid of the problem is honestly the best solution. Once it’s gone, it’s gone forever (with an exception of some sites). You can even block the site/app on your browser or phone. And no, this doesn’t mean you should recreate another account or redownload the app.

, Actually go to limit yourself on how often or how long you use social media and the internet. Time yourself for an hour a day, or set a timer. There are even website blocking applications available now. It can help you be more productive throughout the day.

, Find what interests you. Find a new hobby. Whether it’s art, reading, writing, making music, sports, photography, etc. Start a better lifestyle. Try joining a gym or changing up eating habits.

Close out the Edit Page option and see if you like the way it looks.",How to Make Your about.me Page Visitor Ready," This page has had some editing done, but it's plain and forgettable.;
, Check out some other members of about.me and see what they have done with their pages. Note what you like and don't like.

, It should be 1680 X 1050 so that it fits correctly in the page, if you want a full page image. Choose something that expresses you. If you are a photographer, pick a favored shot.If you don't know how, there is bound to be someone that you know that can help you.


There are many free sites that can help you with that or you could use Paint.

Alternatively, you can use a default image for your background, but remember, so are a lot of other people.

, If not, maybe you should create one! Remember, it doesn't have to be perfect to start with. Like you, it is a work in progress. You don't want it too long or too short.

, While there is probably a lot of information out there about you (possibly good and bad), most people are inherently lazy and will see what's in front of them. Think about what you say. Some great ideas are:Talk about your journey to where you are now. You would be amazed at how many people are interested.
Tell your visitors what you can do for them. This is great because you aren't limited to 140 characters.
Make sure you have a way of being contacted. You are creating this page to get the word out about you. It stands to reason that others will want to 'talk' to you.

Write like you speak. Don't try to impress everyone with your 'prodigious' vocabulary. Chances are if you don't use those words a lot, neither do other people.
Remember that it isn't all about you. You are reaching out to others, so make sure that your biography reflects that.

, You are looking for a positive impact so make sure your colors 'work'.You are allowed to change the colors of Name, Headline, Bio Text, Links, Page Background, and your Bio Background. Just because you have six things that you can change doesn't mean you want six colors.


When you decide on your first color, the Edit Page app suggests colors. That is an easy way of making sure your colors work together.
Another thing that you can do is use the slider. Pick the part of the text that you want to build a color palette around. Choose a color using the slider. This changes as you move the slider so you can see exactly what your page will look like. Then use the suggested colors to make your palette work.

, As with the color, there is a slider bar that you can use to change your text on the fly to get just the look you want.

, Don't expect to get it right the first time.

, Every time you go onto your phone and see the Facebook app, you risk temptation. Deleting these apps makes it easier to stay off social media and focus on what matters most to you.

, If you're finding it hard to avoid clicking to social media websites, download a browser extension like StayFocusd to block the sites.If this seems like an extreme step, only go halfway. Block these sites only on your primary web browser, so you can still access them elsewhere. If you prefer, you can choose to limit your time spent on certain websites rather than block them completely.

, Some people check their social media accounts as soon as they wake up in the morning, during breaks at work or school and while they are falling asleep. Think about when you tend to look at social media, and then find another activity to fill that time.


While you eat meals, try to focus on the food. Think about the taste and texture. If you’re eating with others, talk to them instead of looking at your phone.
When you feel like having a conversation with someone, do it in person. If nobody is around, try going to a café or other busy location where people may be available to chat.
Keep your phone far away from you at night. Not only will this prevent you from using social media, you may fall asleep easier., If you think about it, there are both positive and negative things about social media. If social media didn’t have its benefits, you wouldn’t spend so much time with it! To live happily without social media, you’ll have to replace the positive things about it with positive alternatives. Start by making a few lists.

, What is it that you like about social media? Use concrete examples, like:“I can keep in touch with my friends who live far away.”
“I can find out about things happening in my area.”
“I’m reminded of my friends’ birthdays.”

, Now that you have a list of social media positives, figure out how to accomplish those tasks (or get those feelings) without being tethered to a computer or cell phone. For example:


“I will send letters to and plan to visit my faraway friends.”
“I will find events in the newspaper or by asking friends what they are doing.”
“I will make a list of birthdays and pin it to my wall.”

, Now you’ll make a list of concrete things that bother you about social media. Consider things you haven’t done or finished because of the time you spend on social media. Examples:


“I use social media instead of .”
“I don’t get enough sleep because of how I use social media.”
“I feel insecure when I look at social media.”

, How will those negative things in your life turn into positives if you leave social media?


“I will have more time to do .”
“I will be able to fall asleep earlier if I’m not looking at social media.”
“I will feel better about myself if I don’t see things that make me feel insecure on social media.”

, In addition to getting really good at something, devoting time to a new hobby will help you fill the idle time you once filled with social media. Having a hobby will also boost your creativity and keep your brain sharp.If you’re having trouble thinking of a new hobby, take a look at some of these ideas:


Art: comics illustration, film-making, jewelry-making, making your own clothes, macramé, decoupage, interior design, makeup.
Music: analog synthesizers, choir, making guitar pedals, becoming a DJ.
Writing: lyric poetry, amateur journalism, short stories, personal memoirs.
Exercise: martial arts, swimming, dancing, aerial yoga.
Helping others: raising money for a good cause, helping a non-native speaker learn your language, training pets, sharing meals with people experiencing poverty.

, If part of what you like about social media is how easy it is to meet people, seek a penpal instead. When looking for a penpal, think about things that would keep you interested in writing to someone new. You’ll likely find that getting interesting things in your mailbox is more exciting than any social media notification.


Finding a penpal in another country is a fun way to learn about other places.
In addition to writing letters, you can also send and receive mix CDs of your favorite music, artwork, stickers, photos, and books.

, Because the majority of people get their news on social media, you may be surprised to learn that there are other ways to stay connected to current events.Most areas still print newspapers, most of which you can also find on the web. News radio, podcasts, and television news networks may even expose you to a wider variety of information than what’s supplied by your social networks.

, Studies show that while social media keeps us connected to others online, it decreases the quality of our off-line relationships.You can strengthen these relationships by gathering phone numbers and addresses from people you care about. Write this information down in an address book or personal organizer and keep it handy.


It’s also a good idea to ask them how they like to be contacted. Some people may be more open to talking on the phone than others.
People who are less likely to talk on the phone or make in-person plans may prefer communicating via email.

, When you’re spending quality time with someone, ask them to save social media and texting for later. It probably doesn’t feel good to have to compete with social media for your friends’ attention. Also, hearing about what’s happening on Facebook may entice you to return before you’re ready.

, Having positive experiences and interactions with friends will help you stay both healthy and happy.When you have fun social events on the horizon, you’ll feel less isolated.


Find out which bands or artists are visiting your town, and then plan to see the event with friends.
Research good cafes or restaurants in your area and ask a friend to meet you for a meal.
Plan a camping trip with a group of people. Try to choose a location where the Internet is inaccessible!
Sign up for an activity that requires you and a friend to do something at a regularly-scheduled time. For example, weekly yoga classes, volunteer opportunities, or writing groups.
Start a project with a group of people, such as a band, sports team, or foreign language study group.

, If you often check social media when you’re bored, you’ll need to fill your time with things that keep your mind focused. You clean, read, study, catch up on homework, or go out. Not only will you stay on top of things like coursework or the cleaning, but it may also reduce your social media temptations.

, Hanging out at the same places often will undoubtedly introduce you to people who share similar interests. When you go to these events, appear relaxed, friendly, and approachable to encourage conversation.


Go to the same open mic event every month, and maybe even participate!
Find an art gallery you like and go to their opening every month.
Visit the same café regularly so people start to recognize you.

, You can use a site like Meetup.com to make new friends who like to hang out in-person. You may find a group that shares a certain identity (e.g., heritage, occupation, orientation) or common interest (e.g., oil painting, beat-making, women’s basketball) and forget all about social media.

, If you find yourself unable to stay off social media, reach out to your friends and family. Let them know why you want to stop using social media, and ask them to help you fill your time.


Internet addiction can interfere with life to the point of becoming a serious addiction.If you’re feeling shame and having trouble steering clear of social media, there are non-judgmental therapists and help groups who can help you defeat your addiction.

Questions that were checkboxes for a Goodreads Librarian don't have links to add information in and appear to be blank. Don't worry. It's built so that you are the deciding factor that can accept or decline the answers. If you don't like the way things work, create a secondary account on Goodreads and set it up as a standard user to only submit this data. Have trust in your answers based on your knowledge of the book, if you go and accept your choices for these.

Talk to the person.",How to Use Your Computer to Investigate People," When you are searching public records, you are only getting a small piece of the larger picture. You may find an arrest record, but the details are almost never included. Oftentimes reports will contradict each other, as they come from different sources with data gathered at different times. Always take everything you read with a large grain of salt, and do your best to verify any information through other means.


Even information such as the person's favorite movies or music could be largely incorrect. They may have made that list five years ago and their tastes are completely different now.;
, Common information obtained from public records can include simple things such as name, address and phone numbers. In addition, birth, death, marriage & divorce records and criminal, court, sex offender registries can be searched in some areas. Licenses, property information and a number of other records are kept by the government and certain organizations.

, There are a variety of sites online that will allow you to search public records for free, and even more that will do so for a fee. Keep in mind that all public records aren't necessarily free, and getting the appropriate permit and authorization can take a significant amount of time. Likewise, any records that a site returns may be outdated or incomplete. Here are a couple good places to start:



Free Public Records Search Directory - This site allows you to search public records from any state or on a federal level. If the record cannot be obtained by the search, it will often tell you who to contact to obtain it. You will need to know the general location of the person you are investigating.

Family Watchdog - This site contains the National Sex Offender Registry, and allows you to search for offenders by name or location. Keep in mind that details are often not provided, which can contribute to an unwarranted negative view.

Your local department of corrections website - Almost all states will allow you to search publicly available criminal records. The address is different for each state, but searching for ""<yourstate> department of corrections"" should quickly get you there.

, A paid public records search may yield more results than a free search, but keep in mind that all of the records it retrieves are available if you put the time in contacting the various agencies. If you don't have time to do this, paying for a search may be a better use of your time and money.

, There are several search engines that focus solely on retrieving information about a person from their public social network profiles and online activity. These searches are usually free, though most offer advanced searches for a fee. Using multiple services may help to paint a more complete picture. Popular choices include:Pipl - This site will return social network information, age, and location for free. You just need to enter a name, though you can narrow it down by adding a location. Be aware that a common name will result in a lot of results.

123People - This site will also return social network information, but will also provide links to paid public records searches and criminal background checks.

ZabaSearch - This is another search site that will return similar information, and provides quick links to paid searches for phone numbers and addresses.

, Though it may seem obvious, you can actually find a lot of information about a person from a quick web search. The more you already know about that person, the more results you will get from the search. Use multiple search engines to find more results that others might not have.


Search by name - This is the basic search, and will usually return social network profiles and any mentions in local press.
Search by email. Searching by the person's email address may return results from sites that contains their email address but not their name. You may not find much with this search, but it may help fill in the cracks.
Username search. Try searching for the person's email address without the domain. For example, if the person's email is coolcat74@example.com, you would just search for ""coolcat74"". Oftentimes people will register for forums and websites just using their standard username. This can help you track down forum posts and give you some insight into what that person thinks., You are likely to get a wide range of search results from your various inquiries. Remember, it is always best to assume that the information you find is false or incomplete. Compare your results against each other and see what sort of patterns and consistencies emerge. This can help make sure that what you're finding is at least somewhat accurate.

, This method is pretty dirty, but you may be able to create a fake profile (ideally with an attractive photo) and request to be that person's friend. It will help to have some mutual friends first. Becoming friends will typically give you access to all of their private information that they only allow friends to see.


Many people would consider this to be a massive invasion of privacy, so only do this if you feel you absolutely have to. Be prepared to face serious consequences and be labeled a creep and stalker if you get caught.

, The only way you'll be able to truly verify any information is to talk to the person directly. If you're performing a job interview, you should be able to address any issue you have without raising eyebrows. If you're investigating someone on a personal level, you may have to be a little more tactful about how you bring things up.

Be unique but avoid buzzwords.,

Re-work your bio often.",How to Write a Personal Profile Outline1," Though some of these platforms may have a large word count, the most effective profiles will still be concise and to the point.


Facebook: An “About You” section, including the freeform “Write About Yourself” prompt, Work and Education, “Professional Skills” area, and “Favorite Quotations” section. There is no cap on word count.
Twitter: A 160-character bio, plus space for a link and your location.
LinkedIn: A headline section and a summary section. There is also a section for your resume and skills.;
, Look up several social media profiles on several platforms that use a limited word count to their advantage.


Hillary Clinton’s Twitter profile: “Wife, mom, lawyer, women & kids advocate, FLOAR, FLOTUS, US Senator, SecState, author, dog owner, hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, glass ceiling cracker, TBD ....” In 160 characters, Clinton has managed to include factual details about herself as well as humorous details. Her profile is informative but also entertaining and unique.A short but sweet Facebook profile: Scroll through your friends’ Facebook profiles and look for examples that avoid rambling on in their “About You” section and the “Write About Yourself” prompt. If a friend is trying to create a professional profile on Facebook (which is smart, as employers may do a Facebook search), notice if she uses appropriate content that is still interesting and personal. Ask yourself: if I didn’t already know this person, would I want to be friends with her based on their Facebook profile?
A LinkedIn profile by Corporate Communications specialist: “Even though I am a PR person by trade, I’ll always be a reporter at heart. I’m incapable of pitching something I myself don’t believe in. I have a passion for uncovering unique and compelling ways that people are using a product, service, or site and revel in knowing that I can help thousands of people tell their story.” This introductory paragraph is specific, assertive, and professional. But the author also includes personal details about herself to add some personality to the introduction., Most personal profiles for social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+ only allow you to use a limited number of characters to describe yourself. So it's important to maximize your word count and KISS - Keep It Simple Sweetie.


A good personal profile for a site like Twitter, with its emphasis on short, brief tweets, can almost become a postmodern work of art.Though it can be challenging to cram your persona into a very small profile, think of it like a copywriting exercise. Or an attempt at a six-word memoir.

, Start by making a list of your basic information, like your name, what you do (or what you’re good at), where you live, and any links or tags to other social media sites, like your blog. Remember that readers want to know what they can expect for your social media account and what value you will bring to their Newsfeed, Twitterfeed, or LinkedIn feed.


If you are creating a profile for Twitter, be sure to include any other handles for any other Twitter accounts you also own. For example, if you are creating a profile for your personal Twitter, but also run a Twitter account for your business, include a handle (@ExampleCompany) at the end of your Twitter profile.
For example, a basic Twitter bio could be: “Jane Doe, writer based in California. Also tweets for ABC press @ABCPress”.

, How much or how little personal details you include in your profile will depend on the social media platform you are writing the bio for. Often, social media profiles work well when they have a sense of humor.This could mean a witty descriptor, like Hillary Clinton’s “pant suit aficionado” note, or self-deprecating humor, like a writer who “is sorry/not sorry about correcting your grammar” or a student who is “addicted to caffeine in all its forms.”
Facebook does not have limited space, so you can expand quite a bit on your interests and your background. If you’re creating a professional Facebook profile, it could read very similar to your LinkedIn profile or your Twitter profile. Don’t be afraid to reuse a well-written profile on another site.
Twitter does have limited space, so you will want to say to most you can in the fewest words. You could keep your profile short, such as: “Jane Doe, writer based in California. Also tweets for ABC Press @ABCPress.” Or you could expand it to include personal tastes and some humor, such as: “Jane Doe, word junkie, living the dream in California. Find more of my witty (but clean) tweets @ABCPress.”

, Now that you have your basic information, edit it so it has some personality. But try to stay away from buzzwords, which are words that are considered overused by most readers.


LinkedIn recently put out a list of the buzzwords to avoid.The danger of using buzzwords, such as “responsible”, “creative”, or “efficient” in your profile is that you end up sounding generic or boring.
Think about other terms or phrases that are more specific to who you are. For example, in the Corporate Communications LinkedIn bio, the author avoids buzzwords by expanding on her personal approach to PR: “I have a passion for uncovering unique and compelling ways that people are using a product, service, or site and revel in knowing that I can help thousands of people tell their story.” This is a more compelling sentence than: “I am a responsible, creative PR person who can get the job done.”, If you’re creating a profile for a personal social media account, you could include humor, slang, and catch phrases. If you’re creating a profile for a professional social media account, you may want to be more formal and polished with your language. It’s important to tailor your bio to your audience, and think about how you want your followers or readers to view you.For example, a Twitter bio for your personal account could be: “Jane Doe, word addict, lover of West Coast living, 24/7 sun, and tacos. Also in charge of witty tweets for ABC Press @ABCPress.”
A Twitter bio for a professional page may be more formal. However, most professionals on Twitter still keep their tone pretty casual and light. For example: “Jane Doe, word enthusiast, based in California, also tweets for ABC Press @ABCPress.”

, As your skills, interests, and expertise evolve, so should your bio. Check it every few months to make sure it still reflects you.Revising your bio to include sharper, funnier descriptions and language can also help you get more readers and followers. Paying attention to your personal profile on social media will also show your current followers that you care about how you present yourself, and can do it well.
