Choose if you want to set up a personal Facebook account that also advertises occasional eBay sales, or if you want to set up a business website with the purpose of promoting and marketing your eBay sales.,
Link your eBay account with your Facebook account.,
Add eBay Facebook applications.,
Start sharing your page with friends, after you have posted approximately 20 times.,
Post a Facebook Fan page badge on your website and eBay account.,
Hold contests and promotions on your Facebook page.,
Talk with your fans and encourage them to post to your wall.",How to Use Facebook to Increase eBay Sales1," When you set up an account on Facebook.com, they will ask you to choose whether it is personal or if you are setting up an account for a business or organization.


You must already have a personal page in order to set up a business Fan page. Fan pages are run by administrators who have personal accounts. When you create a Fan page, you will be added as an administrator, and you can appoint others to be administrators and post to the page as well.
If you choose to combine your personal account with your eBay sales, it is a good idea to announce to your friends, family and acquaintances that you will be starting to showcase a few of your eBay sales online. You can ask them to please pass the item on to anyone who they think would like it. It is a good idea to only post sales occasionally, so that people do not get annoyed by constant posting and ""unfriend"" you.
If you create a Facebook Fan page, the term for a business page, then you should create a brand and personality before you start posting eBay sales. Ask a graphic designer to design an attractive profile picture and Timeline cover that boost your image as a professional, reliable business. Also, post professional pictures of yourself and welcoming information in your information and on your wall. In general, social media users do not like a ""hard sell,"" so be ready to mix your eBay sales posts with interesting and fun information.;
, You can do this by clicking on the downward arrow next to your account and changing your account settings. Under the ""General"" tab, find the ""Linked Accounts"" section. Click on ""OpenID"" and add your eBay URL.

, Start by giving the popular app ""eBay Items"" access to your account. You should also consider adding eBay classifieds, eBay selling feed and eBay for iPhone.


Try out each eBay app and decide what best fits your selling style.

, They will be able to see what your focus is, and then share your page with people they think will be interested.

, Also, include a ""Like us on Facebook"" link in all your emails to clients. Cross-promotion through regular marketing, social media and eBay is the best way to increase brand awareness and sales.

, Tell people that if they buy certain products they will receive something for free, or that you are giving away a product to the person with the best product tagline. Get people involved with sharing and visiting your page by giving them incentives.

, As an administrator, you can remove any inappropriate comments. However, you should consider social media marketing as a conversation, so be friendly, deal positively with customer service problems and say ""thank you"" whenever possible.

Understand the role of a personal profile for an application.,
Write your personal profile last.,
Use the first person.,
Include one key experience, achievement, and contribution.,
State your career aim or goal.,
Avoid buzzwords.,
Check that your personal profile fits with your resume and cover letter.",How to Write a Personal Profile Outline2," The purpose of a personal profile is to grab the reader’s attention as soon as they start reading your resume. Along with your cover letter, its your chance to hold their attention, express your key skills and achievements, and entice the employer or judging committee to want to know more about you.Your personal profile is a short introduction to the skills and experience listed on your resume or CV. It should not restate or repeat all the details in your resume or cover letter.
It should be between 50-200 words, or no longer than four-six lines.It should be placed at the beginning of your CV.
If you aren’t sure what your career aims and goals are, it’s better to avoid including a personal profile at the start of your CV. No personal profile is better than a vague or dull profile.

, If you are struggling to condense your career experiences and goals into a few sentences, focus first on your resume and your cover letter. Then, based on the information in your resume and your cover letter, tackle the personal profile. You’ll have a much better idea of what your key skills, experiences, and goals are and your value as an applicant., Though the third person is always an option in a personal profile, using the first person will create a stronger and more direct profile. Your personal profile should be about you and your specific skill set, so using “I” instead of “he” or “she” will create a clear, assertive profile. But this doesn’t mean you have to begin every sentence with “I”. A good personal profile will combine your skills and goals, but not rely on the overuse of “I”.For example: “As a highly-motivated copy editor at renowned publishing house ABC Press, I have a proven track record of providing expert editing services in a wide range of subjects and writing styles, including technical documents and educational texts.”
The use of “As a…” as the first clause in the sentence avoids to overuse of “I” in the personal profile. It also allows you to highlight what your current professional role is and the skills you have developed in your current job.
If you don’t have a current job or role, you can adjust the opening sentence so it is in the past tense.
Avoid mixing the first person and the third person in the same personal profile. Choose one tense and stick to it.

, Think about any past experiences, such as a work experience, a school related experience, an award, an internship, etc. that you want to highlight. Don’t be afraid to brag about your achievement, as this will entice your reader to pay attention to your application.For example, if you want to highlight a recent internship you completed or are currently doing, you may state: “During my recent internship at the non profit Literary Arts organization, I worked with the head of the Writers in Schools program to contribute content to several projects, such as their award winning reading series and their educational outreach program, and managed my own research by interviewing guest writers, creating online copy for their readership, and editing education material for their outreach program. Drawing on my excellent communication skills, I developed and maintained successful working relationships with the staff and the participants at Literary Arts.”

, It’s important to be clear about what you are working towards in your career and what you hope to gain from the possible position. Make sure your career aim or goal relates back to the possible position. This shows you understand what the position is and how it will help you achieve your career goal.For example: “I am looking to secure a position at a top tier publishing house, where I can bring immediate and strategic value and develop my current skill set further.”

, Refer to the LinkedIn list of buzzwords to avoid.Replace any buzzwords, like “dynamic”, “extensive experience”, and “team player” with terms that are more specific to your resume and your career aim or goal.For example, a bland, buzzword filled personal profile might be: “I am an energetic and dynamic person who enjoys a challenge and achieving personal goals. My present career aim is to work in publishing because I like reading and writing.”
A more specific, interesting, and successful personal profile might be: “I am a motivated and detail oriented professional editor looking to secure a position at a top tier publishing house, where I can bring immediate and strategic value and develop my current skill set further. During my recent internship at the Literary Arts organization, I worked with the head of the Writers in Schools program to contribute content to several projects, such as their award winning reading series and their educational outreach program, and managed my own research by interviewing visiting writers, creating online copy for their readership, and editing education material for their outreach program. Drawing on my excellent communication skills, I developed and maintained successful working relationships with the staff and the participants at Literary Arts. I am a reliable, hardworking editor and am eager to expand my skills at ABC Press.”

, Read over your completed personal profile to make sure it matches the skills and experiences discussed in your resume and cover letter. Rather than repeat any points in your resume, your personal profile should act as a summary of your career goals and your skills.Read it out loud for flow and tone, and check that it is under 200 words.
Attach it to the top of your resume and send it out with your cover letter.

Use a recent photo that shows your face.,
Pick a profile name that isn’t too silly or juvenile.,
Ask a close friend to help you write your profile.,
Be specific about your hobbies.,
Be honest and be bold.,
Keep the profile short and sweet.,
Stay positive.,
Check your grammar and spelling.,
Update your profile regularly.",How to Write a Personal Profile Outline3," You don’t need to splurge on a professional photograph, but posting a blurry cellphone photo or a photo of you as a child doesn’t tell the person viewing your profile much about your current appearance.Have a friend take a photo of you, preferably on a summer day. Don’t wear sunglasses, a hat or stand in the shadows.
Don’t forget to smile and look at the camera like you’re happy to see the person behind it. You want your profile picture to be appealing and show you at your best.
Action shots also work well as they show off your interests in an active, immediate way. Choose a shot of you playing ultimate frisbee in the park or dancing at a concert.

, Names like “SpunkyHunk” or “HotMinx” may have been funny back in high school, but silly or overly sexual profile names will only signal to others that you aren’t interested in a serious connection or relationship.Choose a profile name that shows off your personality but still feels grown up. You can also abbreviate your name for an easy profile name. For example: “SuperSteph13” or “BradW.”

, It can be difficult to describe yourself well in words. A close friend may know you better than you know yourself and be able to add in details about yourself that you may not be aware of or feel awkward about putting in your profile.

, Don’t just put down hobbies like “walking on the beach” or “drinking on the weekend”. These are cliches that won’t help your profile stand out. Think of interesting hobbies that could be conversation starters, like “Cards Against Humanity Champion 2015” or “Addicted to traveling in South America” or “Fan of early Battlestar Galactica”.Try to also include sociable hobbies. Hobbies like “bookworm” or “internet addict” indicate you are not a very social person and don’t go out much. Play up your love of anything sporty, outdoorsy, or public, like concerts and art exhibitions.
Focus on concrete and specific details, like your favorite books, films, celebrities, or sports. Rather than noting “hockey”, list your favorite hockey team, or rather than noting “thrillers”, list your favorite action novel.

, Honesty is the best policy in any dating situation, especially online dating. Lying in your profile will make for a very awkward face to face meeting if things end up progressing with a potential mate. So be honest and upfront about yourself.


Be bold in your profile about you’re looking for. Avoid posting a list of highly specific and inflexible demands. Instead, try to write a simple statement that begins with “I believe…” or “I’m seeking…”Instead of: “I’m looking for a tall, strong, outdoorsy, vegan and gluten free guy to sweep me off my feet and be a father of my three (not four!) future children.” Try: “I believe in love and in being respectful and honest with my partner. I’m seeking someone who shares my interests and is serious about a relationship.”
Include a playful question or statement in your profile. This will make your profile more interesting and engaging to potential dates. For example: “If you decide to message me, I want to know: What was the high point of your day today?”

, Imagine you are meeting someone in a bar and only have five minutes to tell them about yourself. Stick to the main points of your biography and your hobbies or interests. Avoid rambling on for paragraphs about yourself., While sarcasm can be great in person, the tone can get a little lost in an online profile. Avoid a negative or snide tone and try to always be positive about yourself. A profile with a bitter, resentful, I-can’t-believe-I’m-online-dating tone can be an immediate turn off. So, focus on what you do want, rather than what you don’t want.Instead of: “I am NOT looking for a casual hook-up or an option relationship, whatever THAT means. Commitment-phobes and flakes stay away.” Try: “I believe that connection can mean different things to different people, but monogamy is my type of connection. It’s the only type of connection I’m looking to make. You, too?”

, Many people find bad grammar and spelling a turn off, or an indication that you didn’t put a lot of time and effort into your profile.


Before you post your profile, copy and paste it into Word and use spell check to make sure your profile is grammatically correct.Be wary of using dating acronyms, like WLTM (Would Like To Meet) and LTR (Long Term Relationship). Not all users will know what these are. If you do want to use them in your profile, here are a list of several common ones:WLTM: Would Like to Meet
GSOH: Good Sense of Humor
LTR: Long Term Relationship
F/ship: Friendship
R/ship: Relationship
F2F: Face to face
IRL: In Real Life
ND: Non-drinker
NS: Non-smoker
SD: Social drinker
LJBF: Let's just be friends
GTSY: Glad to see you
GMTA: Great minds think alike

, Try to review your profile on a regular basis and add in new information about yourself to keep your profile current.

You can create a ""Sponsored Story"" or a ""Facebook Ad."" A sponsored story allows you to advertise content that was posted on Facebook, while a Facebook Ad will advertise a particular business or product.

, Try to post your website name in your original post. Even if someone doesn't click on your ad, they may go to your website to find out more about similar products or visit your Facebook Fan page.

, Facebook ads are advantageous because they allow you to target your ideal client. Facebook ads usually have you pay per click, and you can set a time frame to test your ad out.

, Study the results after a month or 2 to decide if Facebook ads work well for your products. If not, you have probably created some brand awareness, and you can open up that advertising money to use on other sites.

Like comments on your posts.",How to Get People to Like Your Facebook Status," Facebook posts with 80 characters or fewer receive up to 66 percent more engagement than longer posts. While you shouldn't feel confined to this length, keeping your posts short will generally ensure that people will take the time to read your words.Try to keep your posts below 477 characters. After 477 characters, the Read More option appears; many users won't read past the Read More point.;
, While there will be circumstances in which comedy is inappropriate, attempting to inject a lighthearted or humorous tone into the majority of your posts will create a culture of positivity. Facebook users tend to shy away from negative or boring Facebook posts, so having a reputation for positive posting will ensure that people want to visit (and re-visit) your page.


Try placing a humorous spin on an otherwise mundane post (e.g., ""It's so rainy I half expect to see an arc float by my house"").

, If you know that a majority of your Facebook friends lean a certain way on a political issue, writing a post about that issue will attract a lot of attention. As long as you keep your own bias as minimal as possible in the post, you'll likely receive large amounts of likes and comments.


For example: I've seen a lot of media claiming ; I, however, look at it this way: . Does anyone care to discuss?

This same methodology goes for any controversial topic.

, Especially for users scrolling through their News Feeds on mobile platforms, visual media (e.g., photos and videos) are more desirable than text-only posts.These photos should be original, and you should include commentary on them if at all possible.
For example, you might post a photo from a hike with the caption ""Had a great time at last Saturday!""

, You shouldn't do this too often since it can start to feel like you're spamming your friends if you do, but tagging a few friends every once in a while will ensure that their friends see your status on their walls as well. This increases the number of people who can see and interact with your status.For example: Went camping with and last weekend. Stay tuned for pictures!

If your status security settings are set to Private, other people may not be able to see your posts if they aren't your friend on Facebook.

, Liking and commenting on other users' posts will often prompt those users to visit your page and view your content. If you're positive and you leave a polite comment on their status, they'll likely do the same for you out of courtesy.

, When you share on Facebook, your friends and fans want to see your input in addition to the shared link. On top of that, users are less likely to click a link that has no additional text than they are to click one with your commentary. The more people you can get to engage your post, the more likes and conversation that post will attract!, Public posts reach people outside of your Friends list, and you can use tags (e.g., ""#globalwarming "") to designate the topic of your post so that other users who are interested in your tagged topic can view your post simply by typing the tag into the Facebook search bar.


You can change who can see your post by clicking the Friends bar beneath your post's text field (desktop site) or by tapping the Friends bar beneath your name in the ""Update Status"" box (mobile app) and then selecting Public.

, While strictly up to you, doing this will increase the base number of people who can see your posts. If you only have 100 friends or so, the number of likes you can receive on personal or business posts has a fairly low upper limit.


Adding friends is a good way to increase your outreach without posting publicly.
If you have a business page on which you're trying to get likes, invite as many people as you can to like your page.

, This is a great way to ensure that people will comment on your post, at the very least, and posts with large numbers of comments receive higher visibility in other friends' News Feeds.Don't ask personal questions, since you're liable to receive less engagement for an embarrassing topic.

, Responding to your friends will give them a reason to keep coming back to your post. It will also foster a conversation, meaning your post will stay active in your friends' New Feeds for longer. In turn, people will have more time throughout the day to view and interact with your Facebook post.A good way to do this is by saying something like ""Hey , thanks for reaching out!"" and then addressing the question or comment.
Liking or commenting on old posts (especially photos) will bring them back to the top of your friends' News Feeds. This is a good way to increase engagement on posts from your past that failed to reach your target number of users.

, While liking comments on your own posts is similar to responding to user comments, it also contributes to other users wanting to like your comments. This is another way to increase your posts' visibility by keeping them active for longer."

Go to your human resources (HR) manager to ask for the company's social media policy.,
Check if your company is using Twitter for promotional reasons.,
Ask about your company's approach to micro-breaks, if they do not allow social media use during work hours.,
Research competition, industry information and current events using Twitter.,
Realize that most companies track web usage.",How to Use Twitter at Work1," Proskaueh recently released a global survey that showed that over 50 percent of companies have a social media policy in place, and around 70 percent of businesses blocked social media sites at work. In some cases, a social media policy is just a list of best practices, and does not block employees from using it.


In the company's social media policy, look at how they define social media and any occasions that it can be used. Also, find out if you are allowed to identify yourself as an employee of your company on your personal Twitter account, and what disciplinary actions are given if you use Twitter in a way that is deemed inappropriate.
Do not ask about a specific social media site and try not to go directly to your manager. These could be red flags to your boss that you are not getting your work done. In some cases, you may already have access to the employee rule book that states the social media policy, in which case, you should use it before speaking to HR.
Some companies have a policy of allowing unrestricted use of the Internet as long as you complete your work. If this is the policy, and especially if you work in a small, close knit office, then you should feel free to use Twitter during work, as long as it does not affect your work performance.;
, After work, check for a company Twitter account, and see if there is a case that could be made for having a company Twitter account. If you work in customer service, marketing or as an office manager, a case could be made for creating a company-linked account and using it to help the company respond to customer service problems, communicate brand promotion and tweet about company culture, respectively.


If you are able to use work hours to complete Twitter tasks, you will be managing your personal and company Twitter account separately. However, you will be able to keep the Twitter website up on your browser, which will allow you to keep track of trending topics and check other people's Twitter accounts individually.

, A recent study by University of Melbourne's Dr. Brent Coker, said that workers who are allowed unrestricted Internet access during coffee or micro-breaks, have increased productivity of 9 percent. You may want this time to check bank accounts, check personal email or use social media accounts.

, If you work as a researcher, marketer or manager, you should do regular searches of Twitter using the company's main keywords, to make sure you are staying on top of the market. You may need to be authorized by your manager in order to use it in this capacity.

, If you have never been in trouble for using work time for personal Internet tasks, you may not know that IT departments gather web usage reports each month, which chart web time, bandwidth usage and sites that are visited. It may reflect poorly on your performance review if you use Twitter's official website during work hours, if you have not been appointed to do it for work reasons.

You have the added advantage of being able to check posts and tweet during your commute, lunch breaks and coffee breaks.


Although most employers look down on employees receiving personal calls during work time, most employers do not have any policies against having a phone at work. As long as you check your Twitter app covertly, you are likely not to get in trouble.

, You can either have them sent to your personal email, if you are allowed to use it during work hours, or you can take the risk of having them go to your work email. Try NutShellMail.

One of your own photos: Click on ""Photos"" at the top of your home page. Here, you can browse the photos you've taken as well as the photos other people have taken of you with the links at the top.

A friend's photo: Go to the friend's profile and select ""Photos"" from the menu bar. On the next page, browse through the photos of your friend and the photos your friend has taken with the links at the top.
You can also tag any photo that you see in your news feed (or a friend's).;
, Once you see the photo you want to tag, click on it. This will open a larger version of the photo along with options for tagging it.

, On your own photos, this button is on the right side of the photo page (next to any caption or comments), labeled with this text and a picture of a tag.

, If the person you want to tag is in the photo, just click on his or her face. This will bring up a new popup menu.


If you're tagging someone who isn't in the photo, just click somewhere in the photo that's not a face (like in the corner). Facebook users sometimes do this to tag the photographer, for example, but you can also tag someone who has no connection to the photo if you think they should see it.

, In the text box that pops up, start typing in the person's name. A list of friends that match your text will show up below. Click the name of the friend you want.

, Once you've placed one tag, just repeat the steps above to add more. You can add as many tags as you want anywhere on the photo. However, you can't tag the same person twice in one photo.


A word of warning: it's sometimes considered rude or obnoxious to go overboard with tagging. For example, if you tag your friends in photos from a few years ago, they'll all receive a notification for something that's not ""new"" — many consider this slightly annoying.

, When you are finished tagging the photo, click the ""Done Tagging"" button at the bottom of the photo or to the right. You can also just press ""Enter.""If you've tagged one of your friends, you're all done!

Repeat as desired.,
Finish your post.",How to Tag People on Facebook2," Tagging someone in a text post is similar to the tagging process for photos, but even quicker. As you start to type your friend's name, a list of matches will automatically drop down. Proper spelling and capitalization count here — mistakes can make it so that your friend doesn't show up in the list.You can do this for both status updates and comments. The process is the same for both.

, Click on your friend's name from the list to make a tag. His or her name will appear in your post highlighted in blue to show that this person has been tagged.

, One nice thing about text posts is that, unlike photos, they let you tag Facebook pages and groups as well as people. In this case, Facebook won't detect that you're trying to make a tag automatically, so start by typing the @ symbol, then type the name of your group, like this: @Star Wars.Click the page you want from the list that drops down.


You don't have to like a page or be a member of a group to tag these things in your text posts. However, pages and groups you are connected to will show up at the top of the list.

, You can have as many tags per post as you want. Repeat the steps above to add each new tag.

, If you want to, you can type a message along with your tags, or you can post your tags alone — it's up to you. Either way, your post won't be ""posted"" until you press enter or click the ""Post"" button.


One common way to use tags is to incorporate them seamlessly into your message, like this (italic text signifies a tag):



""Having a great time with Jane Smith at @Davenport Beach.""




You can also just put the tags at the beginning or the end of your message — this is also common. See below:



""Having a great time. Jane Smith @Davenport Beach""




Finally, you can just post the tags by themselves without a message.

For the mobile browser version of Facebook, tag like you would on a computer.,
Learn how to make tags on Apple and Android devices.,
Learn how to make tags on Windows devices.",How to Tag People on Facebook3," Virtually any smartphone with an internet connection can access the browser version of Facebook at m.facebook.com. To be clear, these instructions are for the browser version of Facebook — not the mobile app.



Tagging Photos: Open the photo and tap the ""tag photo"" button below it. Type the names of the people you'd like to tag (separated by spaces), then click ""Done."" You can't select specific spots in the photo to tag with the mobile browser.Tagging Text Posts: Virtually the same as for desktop — start typing the name of the person or group and select the appropriate option from the list that drops down.

, The Facebook app for Apple and Android has several simple tagging options. Both platforms use basically the same process — differences are very minor and noted below:



Tagging Photos: Go to the photo you want to tag. Look for a blue tag icon near the bottom. Tap the face of the person you want to tag. Type in his or her name in the text box, then tap the person you want from the drop-down list. For Apple devices, you may need to click ""Done"" to finish.Tagging Text Posts: Same as for mobile browser/desktop (see above)., Tagging in the Windows Facebook app works very similarly to the Apple and Android apps. However, there is one difference when it comes to text posts:


Tagging Photos: Virtually the same as for Apple/Android (see above).Tagging Text Posts: Identical to Apple/Android except that you have to put an ""@"" sign before every tag — even for your friends."
"
Use tags to get specific peoples' attention.,
Be aware that tagged content will appear in your friends' feeds.,
Adjust your tag's privacy settings to change who can see it.",How to Tag People on Facebook4," Tags are a way of creating a connection between a specific piece of content on Facebook and a person, page, or group.When you tag someone in a photo or text post, people who see this content will have a link they can click to visit the page of whoever or whatever you tagged.


In addition, tagging someone will send them a notification unless they have specifically chosen not to get notifications from tags. This means that you can call someone's attention to your content by tagging them — the notification will link them right to where they're tagged.

, When you tag someone in a piece of content, this content will often appear in their news feeds. It may also appear in the news feeds of people who are friends with the tagged person.This is important to understand — you don't, for instance, want to embarrass a friend by tagging him in an inappropriate photo, as this will make it easier for his friends and relatives to see it.

, Luckily, it's possible to make it so that the the things you post on Facebook (including any tags you make on them) are seen only by the people you want. This is done with a tool called the audience selector, which only works for your own photos and status updates.


When you're making a status update or posting a video, look for a button next to the ""Post"" button with an arrow pointing downward. It should be labeled with your current audience settings (usually ""Public"" or ""Friends""). Click this button and use the options in the drop-down menu to determine who can see your post (as well as any tags you make on it).
Note again that you can't control who sees your posts when you're commenting on someone else's photo or text."

Make sure that your industry has a presence on Facebook.,
Sign up for a LinkedIn account at the same time as you sign up for Facebook.,
Change your privacy settings.,
Write or rewrite your ""Info"" section of your profile to include education, professional experience and a philosophy based on your experiences and professional goals.,
Decide what part of your personality you want to show on Facebook.,
Start writing status updates about business, partnerships and new projects.",How to Prepare Yourself to Use Facebook for Professional Networking1," For example, recruitment, entertainment, media, advertising and sales professionals often use Facebook for professional networking; however, if you are part of other industries, there may not be very many people in your industry to network with. Decide if your industry, colleagues and previous employers are using Facebook, before you take the time to use a Facebook account for self-promotion.;
, You can follow many of the same rules as listed above. However, it is never a good idea to put all your networking efforts into 1 social media site, because not everyone uses Facebook for professional networking.


LinkedIn is often seen as the best social media platform for professionals. The profile function is set up like a resume, and businesses often use their accounts to post newly available jobs.







, Your profile should be public, if you want to network, so that people in your industry can find you. However, you should have to approve of all posts, photos and friends before they can appear on your wall.

, Think of this as an ""elevator pitch,"" describing you as a person, employee and professional. It should have a small amount of personality, and have no grammar mistakes.

, You don't want your profile to be too personal, but you do not want it to be bland. For example, if 1 of your interests is nature photography, if you support a charity or if you contribute to a blog online, be sure to include these so that they deliver a small dose of what makes you special or interesting.

, Unlike personal accounts, professional Facebook accounts should not have political, religious, intimate or even goofy status updates. Decide if you would want a potential employer to see the post before you update your status.

Rethink your attitude toward Facebook, if you are on it already.,
Start deleting photos that could be seen as unprofessional.,
Manage your friends wisely.,
Delete applications, groups, games and more that are not necessary for professional networking.",How to Prepare Yourself to Use Facebook for Professional Networking2," For most people, Facebook is a place to share and converse with friends. For professionals, the sharing of photos, non-professional articles, media and personal conversation is at a minimum, and Facebook serves as a virtual resume.

, This means anything with drinking or partying should be deleted. Untag yourself in photos that are unappealing or inappropriate, if someone else posted them.

, Some people are not ready to make the complete break from using their profile as a purely professional tool. There are a number of strategies you can adopt to control what friends you have and what they see.


Unfriend people who are non-professional acquaintances, or if you fear they will post something on your wall.
Request friendships from old colleagues, people from your programs during college and professionals you meet in person. Develop a friend list that consists of professionals, mentors and industry leaders.
Separate your personal and professional friends. Go to your home page and click on the ""More"" link next to the ""Friends"" option. Click on the ""Create a List"" button in the right hand corner. Make a list of all your professional acquaintances, and name it ""Professional."" Next, go to your Privacy Settings in the upper right drop down menu. Choose ""Custom"" and you can create the option to hide or show your content, as you post it, according to certain lists of people. Click the drop down menu under your status update to choose your customized post audience. For example, it might say ""Friends; except Professional"".

, Removing things like Farmville, unnecessary Fan Pages or Places will remove clutter. Start becoming fans of past employer pages, local museums and other pages that would add to your professional resume.

Think of some keywords for your industry. Search for them in the top search bar. When your results appear, click on ""groups"" instead of ""all results,"" and you will find options of groups to join. Look at the group, and join groups if they list their members' profiles, list job postings and have good discussions about industry topics.
In some cases, the group administrators will check your page before admitting you to the group. Click the ""Ask to Join"" button to the right of the group name.

, If you have interesting discussions with people in your group, you will soon find people in your region who would be good professional contacts. Introduce yourself by a personal message.

, You can also build small business networks this way. Only do this if you are prepared to spend extra time being a group administrator, suggesting topics of discussion and posting industry articles.

, You can add the LinkedIn application to your profile, and people will be able to click on it to see your resume and experience. A potential client, employer or professional may choose to connect with you through LinkedIn, rather than Facebook.

Freshen up.,
Enhance your features.,
Choose the right clothes.",How to Take an Amazing Facebook Profile Picture1," A healthy appearance is very attractive,so by looking fresh, you’ll look your best. Do your normal hygienic routine like brushing your teeth or taking a shower before taking your photo.


Exfoliate and moisturize your face and body to give you a nice smooth glow. Take the extra step to floss. This removes plaque and will give you a brighter smile.;
, Style your hair in a way that best frames your face or use quality make up to highlight your features. Think about what you do to look great on a first date or to an important interview and do exactly that. If you love your look, you’ll be more comfortable in front of the camera.


If you have the money and time, go to a stylist and have them give you a make over before you take your picture. Ask them to teach you how to do it home, so if you want to take more pictures you can do it yourself.

, Wear something that flatters your figure and makes you stand out in a crowd. Bold colors will put the focus on you, whether your background be a clear sky or a busy street. Use an accessory to make you dazzle, but does not draw attention away from your face.


Make sure there are no unsightly stains or tears in inappropriate places.

Define the problem (realistically).,
Consider the way your response could affect the problem.,
Imagine how the recipient might feel about receiving the message.,
Be proactive about responding.,
Send a quick apology if it was a harmless mistake.,
Write a rough draft of your response.,
Start by restating the problem (with no excuses).,
Express remorse by saying “I’m sorry” or “I apologize.” No matter the severity of the situation, it’s important that your expression of remorse sound sincere.,

Know your limits.,
Stop, read and think before you press send.,
Institute a personal time delay.,
Foster positive social media habits.",How to Take Action After Sending a Facebook Message by Mistake," Before doing damage control, take a few minutes to look at the facts of the situation. A reactionary response could make the situation worse. Answer these questions so you know you’re getting a clear picture of the situation:


Is what I sent to this person going to hurt their feelings?
If this person reads this message with no other communication from me, will our relationship be damaged?
What is my biggest fear about the outcome of this situation? What’s the worst that will happen if that fear comes true?;
, You feeling embarrassed is one thing, but hurting or embarrassing someone else is more. Anything you say or do now has the potential to make the situation better or worse.


If you accidentally sent private or personal information about someone else to the wrong person, a serious response is definitely in order.
If you accidentally sent an embarrassing message about yourself, it may help to send a quick “Oops, sorry!” with a touch of humor to avoid straining the relationship.

, While you may be horrified, the person to which you accidentally sent a message may giggle and brush it off as a silly mistake. Or, what you may interpret as a silly mistake may embarrass or disgust the recipient. Keep these thoughts in mind for when you draft a response.


Imagine you sent a message meant for your romantic partner to your mother. She's probably feeling just as upset about reading it as you are about sending it.
If you asked someone on a date but sent the message to the wrong person, it’s likely that the recipient is not feeling embarrassed at all. In most cases, they’ll be flattered.

, Instead of waiting for others to notice and respond to your mistake, take action before the situation gets further out of your control. Accepting responsibility for the message will show the recipient you are serious about making amends., If you accidentally sent a random, unoffensive message to the wrong person, apologize for the inconvenience to them and move on.You might feel a little embarrassed by your mistake, but it's not the worst that could happen.


Using humor in your response can help keep the mood light and decrease future strain on your relationship.

, Grab a sheet of paper and a pen (or a blank document on your computer) to compose your response. This will help you avoid sending another message you’ll regret.


When you’re done drafting your response, consider how you’d like to deliver it. In most cases, sending it through Facebook is fine, but sometimes a phone call is more appropriate.
Be honest when drafting your response. Getting caught in a lie could destroy your credibility, relationships, or reputation., If the message was offensive, contained private information about someone else, or included inappropriate content, your response should begin with a formal apology. You should not blame the sent message on anyone else, not even Facebook. By admitting what you’ve done, you show that you accept responsibility for the mistake. Some examples:


“I sent you a photo that was meant for someone else.”
“I accidentally forwarded a message that was meant for someone else.”
“The message I just sent you contains private information about someone else.”

, Here are some examples:


“I am so sorry that you had to see that message.""
“I apologize for my careless error.”
“I am really sorry. I feel so ashamed by what I’ve done.”

, This part of the message will show the recipient that you want to make the situation right.A good way to make amends is to say something like, “If there is anything I can do to make it up to you, please let me know.”
If there’s an action you could take to ease the situation for everyone involved, offer to take that action and make sure you follow through.
When making amends, you may feel tempted to offer something you can’t fulfill. Try to resist that temptation—sometimes feeling guilty can tempt us into giving more than what is appropriate, necessary, or even possible.

, Now that you’ve expressed remorse, taken responsibility, and offered to make amends, you’ll need to rebuild trust. Assure this person that you will be more careful in the future.Some examples:


“In the future, I’ll definitely pay close attention to what I send on Facebook.”
“I have learned that not paying attention to what I’m doing can be damaging. I’ll keep that in mind, going forward.”

, Now it’s time to re-read your message and do some final edits before sending. In addition to fixing grammar and spelling issues, look out for the following missteps:


Make sure you’re not blaming Facebook. Remove lines like “I don’t know why Facebook did this” or “Facebook is always messing up on me.”
Don’t blame other people. Remove stuff like “This wouldn’t have happened if XXX didn’t send this as a group message,” or “Next time, you shouldn’t forward me anything.”

, You’ve crafted an appropriate apology, and now it’s time to send it off.

, If you sent a message to someone that makes you feel embarrassed but is not hurtful to anyone, know that the worst is over. A random message sent to the wrong person might be embarrassing, but it won’t kill you.

, Embarrassment and anxiety manifest in many physical ways. You may feel lightheaded, weak, have a stomach cramp, or a headache.Take deep breaths, do a little stretching, and make sure you stay hydrated. As time passes, these symptoms will fade, along with your embarrassment.

, If the issue is the result of a group message gone awry, staying a member of the group may only make the situation worse. If a conversation gets heated or inappropriate, it's best to leave it before sending a message you might later regret.Click the Messages icon at the top right of any Facebook page, (or launch Messenger if you’re using a mobile device.)
Open the group conversation you want to leave.
Click the wheel icon (desktop) or the arrow icon (Messenger) at the top right corner of the message.
Select “Leave Conversation” (on all platform).
A notification will be sent to the others that you have left the conversation, and you won't receive any further messages.

, Having to look at something hurtful over and over again isn’t good for anyone. If you wince in pain every time you see the harmful message in your inbox, you can archive the message. This won’t delete it, but it’ll file it away so it’s no longer in your face. You’ll be able to find it at any time by searching for the recipient’s name.Open your inbox by clicking the Messages icon at the top right of any Facebook page, or launch Messenger on your mobile device.
If you’re using the desktop version of Facebook, click the X next to the conversation you want to archive.
In Facebook Messenger for mobile devices, swipe left on the message and select “Archive.”

, If the person to whom you wrongfully sent a message responds expressing sadness, embarrassment, or anger, respond with a brief message that makes them feel seen, heard, and understood. Some examples:


If the person responding says that they are very angry, say, “I hear that you are angry, and I definitely understand why.”
If a person says they are embarrassed, say, “I can understand why you would feel embarrassed. I would also feel embarrassed if someone did to me what I did to you.”
If they say they are devastated, say, “I understand and accept that my actions have been upsetting to you. That’s totally valid.”

, Receiving an angry response from someone you upset won’t feel good, but it’s a part of their process. However, abusive language and threats of violence are never okay, even when you’ve upset someone. Report any hate speech or threats of violence to Facebook.

, While you can't take back messages you've already sent, you can stop yourself from making the same mistake twice.


Before you send any message, take a moment to read back over it and think about how it might affect you, the person receiving it, or someone else.
Make sure you've selected the correct recipient and that you haven't included any information you may later regret.

, Waiting a certain amount of time will force you to take a break and reflect on your message. Pick an amount of time (1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes) and make yourself wait that amount of time before pressing Send.

, Consider why you want to use Facebook and how you want to represent yourself to others on it.If you think of Facebook as a place where you will only engage in positive conversations, you can opt out of heated or inappropriate conversations right away and avoid sending messages you might later regret."

Good lighting is key.,
Have a clear background.,
Find a good frame.,
Use the Rule of Thirds.",How to Take an Amazing Facebook Profile Picture2," No matter what is in the background, you actual image will look great with soft lighting. Soft lighting is where shadow transitions are soft, where there aren’t strong shadows on your face or objects around you.


Think about a candlelit room or mood lighting for a romantic dinner, where warm soft light is found all around you.
The best places to find soft light are in open shade, where the light isn’t shining directly on you. This could be on the side of a building or house.
Up lighting, or hard light, can be harsh and highlight undesirable features like wrinkles and baggy eyes. , If possible, try not to have anything directly behind you so you remain the focus of the photo. Solid colors or simple wall patterns are ideal, but make sure you stand out against them.


If you are at a party, step away from the crowd and snap your photo. Go it alone because it is your profile picture so it should be all about you.

If you are in a group photo, try to place yourself in the center.



, The world is filled with natural frames such as alleyways, mountain ranges, trees, doorways, even people! Put these objects around the edge of the photo so you become the main subject. This will make you the main point of interest.

, Divide your image into 9 equal sections by 2 vertical and 2 horizontal lines. Position yourself and or other important images in your scene along these lines or the intersections. This will add balance and interest to your photo. If you are taking a picture with a object or monument, this is an aesthetically pleasing rule to use. Symmetry is very eye catching. "

Use a nice mirror.,
Angle your body.,
Use your “good side”.,
Elongate your neck.,
Relax your arms and hands.,
Analyze celebrities similar to you.,
Avoid clichéd poses.",How to Take an Amazing Facebook Profile Picture3," While you are experimenting with which pose, angle, and facial expression to use in your photo, practice in a clean mirror. Make sure your mirror is not distorted, marked up or blurry. This will ensure the most accurate results in your findings.

, To thin yourself out, angle your body about 45 degrees away from the camera, but keep your head looking at the camera. Position your body with one foot slightly forward, or shoulder if you are sitting. , Our bodies and faces are generally not mirrored images. Find which side of your face and body you prefer and make that side more visible in the photo.


Look through photos you have posed in and you may find you have a tendency to turn your face to the right or left. This is probably the side you prefer, and feel most comfortable posing with. , This simulates height and poise. It may feel unnatural, but when roll your shoulders back and look in the mirror, you’ll find it is instantly slimming. , Place a hand on your hip and make sure there is a small separation between your limbs and body. This way your arms will not squish against your body. Play with what you are wearing. Toss your dress around or thumb your suspenders or belt., Find someone in similar age, height and body shape and look at photos they have modeled in. Try out their poses and see if their stances suit you.

, Most of the time people use clichéd poses because they are uncomfortable. These are poses like the “duck face”, “tongue-in-cheek”, or flashing a gang sign. If you are nervous step away for a minute and when you come back into frame take the photo immediately. You will have less time to be self-conscious.

Find a camera.,
Sizing.,
Take a selfie.,
Get a photographer.,
Time the photo.,
Take a lot of photos.",How to Take an Amazing Facebook Profile Picture4," In this modern age cameras are accessible almost everywhere. Choose which camera you would like to use be it your computer webcam, cell phone, film/digital camera, or disposable camera.


If you do not have any of these, go to your nearest electronics store and ask an employee which camera would work best for you.
If you are low on cash, buy a disposable camera from places like grocery stores or gas stations. Otherwise, ask a friend if you can use their camera.

, Decide whether you want a “mug shot” or full-length photo. Facebook profile pictures are small sized, so having either a head shot would be best. If you love your shape, try a pose to the waist.

, Selfies are self-portraits generally taken by a digital camera or camera phone supported by your hand or “selfie stick”. Taking selfies enable you to have more control over how others see you. For most people, the best angle for a selfie is one that's slightly higher than their line of vision. And you probably shouldn't stare directly into the camera, either. Most people don’t look their best straight on, so angle your face using your “good side”. Selfie sticks are monopods that help you take selfies beyond the range of your hand. Otherwise, elongate your arm and snap a photo of yourself.
If you are using a smart phone, flip your phone so you can see your image in the screen. You can position the image exactly as you please and snap a photo

Try to keep your arm out of the frame.
most phone cameras are higher quality on the back of the phone (not in forward facing mode), so it may be better to have someone take you picture for you, even if it's selfie-style.


If you don’t have a smart phone or you are using a camera, find a mirror so you can still see your image. If there is no mirror accessible, angle it toward you as best you can.

Most selfie sticks come with mirrors. , Find a friend or someone nearby to take a photo of you. Make sure your photographer knows how to focus the camera to avoid blurriness and pixelation. Generally cameras have a little box that pops up when looking through/at the screen. Have them center you in this box and snap the photo. This is the easiest way to center and focus the photo.


If the box does not show up automatically, there should be an option in the settings or directions of the camera to show you how to make it appear.
To spice up the image, have your photographer zoom in all the way, step back until your image clearly fills the frame (with space around all sides), and snap the photo.

Make sure the flash is off to avoid harsh light.



, Having a timer will enable you to position yourself in the ideal way. Ask your photographer to give you a countdown, or give yourself a countdown. If you are taking a selfie, rest the camera on a stable surface, set the timer, and get into position.


Read the directions that come with your camera on how to set a timer. If you lost the hard copy of the directions, a google search should prove fruitful.

, By taking a lot of photos you have a larger selection to choose from. The first couple snapshots may not turn out the way you envisioned, so take a lot and pick the one you like the best.


Throughout the photo-shoot, periodically look at the photos you have taken. This way you can judge what you need to change in order to take an amazing picture. For example, you may need to change locations, switch up your posture, or fix your hair.

Get invited to the M beta.,
Start a chat with M in the Messenger app.,
Chat with M in natural English.,
For example, you could ask M to tell you a joke, or recommend a good place to take a date.,
Ask M to perform a task you would normally do over the phone or online.,
Tell M to remind you about something.,
Have M greet you with inspirational quotes.,
Use M for tasks that aren't time sensitive.",How to Use Facebook M," M is currently only available for a small group of users in California. Some of these users may be able to send out invites, but the program is very limited at the moment. You'll receive a message from ""M"" in Messenger if you are invited to the program., You'll be communicating with M using the Messenger app from Facebook. After being invited, you'll be able to find M in your Messenger contacts.

, M is designed to converse with you in a natural way. It can respond to regular questions and comment on your responses. This is because M is more than just a chat bot; there are actual people overseeing the process. Any time M cannot complete something automatically, a real human steps in. You'll never know if you're speaking to a real person or to the AI., Simply say ""Where's a good place for a cheap date downtown?"" and M will respond with some options for you. You can then ask about each one for some more information, such as, ""How late is the ice cream shop open?""

, You can use M to automate a lot of the things you used to do over the phone or through an online ordering system. M can call customer service, order food, book reservations, and more. You can even find, book, and pay a flight from start to finish.Ask M to perform a variety of different tasks, and you may be surprised what it's capable of.For example, you could ask M, ""What are some good steakhouses around my work?"" M may ask to clarify your current location, then it would return results based on reviews and location. You could then say, ""Make me a reservation for 4 people at 6:30 tonight"" and M would call the restaurant and place your reservation. After the reservation has been placed, you'll be notified that your table will be waiting.
You can have M call customer service lines for you. M can call your power company and request your last bill be sent again, or it can call Amazon to check on the status of a refund. Simply ask M to do it, and in most cases M will start working without issue. In cases like these M, may ask for a bit more information, such as what you ordered or your email address.

, You can set reminders with M and you'll receive a message at the appropriate time. Just tell M what you want to be reminded about and when.


For example, you can tell M to remind you to clean out your gutters this weekend. M will end you reminders throughout the weekend until you let it know that you finished the task.

, Ask M to send you an inspirational quote every morning and you'll receive a new quote at the same time each day. Try asking for different types of quotes to see what M can do., There are a lot of reports that M is rather slow when asked to perform tasks. This is likely because real people are performing them for you behind the scenes. Try to use M for less important activities, such as setting reservations for dinner later in the evening, or purchasing movie tickets for the weekend."

Learn some basic terms.,
Know the consequences.",How to Unblock Facebook1," When it comes to accessing websites that are blocked on your network, there are a few terms that will be useful to have a basic understanding of.


Server - This is a computer located somewhere else that is processing your request for a webpage and sending you the data. All websites are stored (hosted) on servers.
Proxy - This is a server that acts as a ""middleman"" for your webpage requests. You tell the proxy server what website you want, and then the proxy retrieves the website data and sends it on to you.
VPN - VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, and acts like a ""tunnel"" through the internet to a server. This server then handles all of your webpage requests. It is similar to a proxy but much more secure (and costly).
Encryption - When you connect to a website using a secure connection, such as with a VPN, your data is scrambled, or ""encrypted"". This prevents someone from intercepting your data and stealing your information.

, Chances are that Facebook and other sites are blocked for a reason. If you use any of these methods at school, you can face suspension or expulsion if discovered. If you use these methods at work and are found out, you may be reprimanded or terminated.

Understand what a proxy website does.,
Find a list of proxy websites at home.,
Make a list of 15 proxies to try.,
Visit the first proxy site on your list on the blocked network.,
Enter the Facebook URL into the field.,
Browse Facebook.",How to Unblock Facebook2," A proxy website is a proxy server that is running a website interface. You visit the proxy website and enter in the address you want to access. The proxy server retrieves the information and then transfers it to your browser. Your network only sees the data being sent to and from the proxy website, and not to and from Facebook.Logging into Facebook using this method is not secure, and should only be used to view pages. If you want to log into your own account, or use any website where you need to log in securely, use one of the other methods in this article.;
, There are lots of websites that list tons of proxy websites you can use, but these are typically blocked by your network administrator. You'll want to visit these listing sites at home so that you can see them. Popular listing sites include:Proxy.org
Web-Proxy-List.co.uk
Webproxylist.biz

, Network administrators are constantly adding new proxies to their block lists, and new proxy websites come out every day. You'll want a decent list of sites to try so that if one is blocked you can try the next.

, If the proxy website is blocked, try the next one on your list. Continue until you find a proxy site that is not blocked by your network administrator.


There's a very good chance that using the proxy website will alert the network administrator, and you may find that same site blocked tomorrow.

, Proxy websites typically have a field that you can enter a website's address into. Type in facebook.com or paste in the address for a Facebook page and click the button to load the site.

, Once you've loaded the site in the proxy, you can start using it. Because the information is being displayed through the proxy in your browser, certain elements on the page may not load properly. This usually means that the layout won't look correct, or videos won't play.

Sign up for a VPN service.,
Connect to your VPN service.,
Open Facebook in your web browser.",How to Unblock Facebook3," VPN services offer servers that you can connect to which you then process your network traffic. You connect directly to the VPN and all data is automatically encrypted, meaning your network only sees an encrypted connection to the VPN, not any of the sites you visit while connected.


You'll need to be able to setup the VPN connection on your computer or mobile device in order to connect to it. This is fine for your own laptop or phone, but may be difficult or impossible on a computer that you don't own.
You'll want to pick a reputable VPN service, as you are trusting them with your data. There are free VPN services, but as with any free service if you aren't paying for the product you are the product.

, The process for this varies depending on the operating system and type of device you are using. You likely won't be able to do this on any device that you do not own, as these functions are typically locked down.



Click here for detailed instructions on connecting to a VPN for a variety of different devices.
Connecting to a VPN affects all of the internet traffic on your device, including chat programs and video games.

, Once you are connected, you can open your web browser and browse to Facebook. Since you're connecting to a VPN, it may take a little longer than normal to load websites.


As long as you trust your VPN provider, you can log into Facebook without having to worry about your account being compromised.

, Click the Network icon in your System Tray (Windows) or menu bar (OS X) and select your phone. The computer will connect to the phone's network so that it can use the internet.

, Once the computer has connected to the phone's network, you can use your web browser to open Facebook. Since you're connecting through you're cellular data plan, you are safe to log into Facebook securely.

, When you load a webpage on your computer, it loads the desktop version, which typically requires much more data to be transferred than the mobile version of a website. This can become a problem if you have a low data cap or are close to using your monthly allowance.

Download and install PHProxy on your home computer.,
Password-protect your PHProxy server.,
Open Port 80 for your home computer.,
Find your home network's public IP address.,
Connect to your proxy server from another computer.,
Use a portable browser (optional).",How to Unblock Facebook5," If you have a computer at home that you can leave on while you're at work or school, you can use it to create your own private proxy server. Since you're connecting to your own computer (which you trust), you can safely log into any website that requires a secure login.


You can use this method to create a webpage that you can then access from the blocked network, or you can configure a portable browser to connect directly to the proxy server. Both will be covered here.
This is by far the most secure method, should bypass most blocks, and won't cost you anything (other than electricity and internet costs for your home computer).

, This is a free, open-source web server program that is easy to install and configure. Click here for detailed instructions on installing XAMPP.

, This is a free, open-source proxy utility for your new webserver. You can download PHProxy from sourceforge.net/projects/poxy/.


Extract the ZIP file that you downloaded and copy the folder to your ""www"" or ""htdocs"" folder in the XAMPP installation directory. This is all you need to do to install PHProxy.
Test it out by opening your browser and visiting http://localhost/phproxy/. If the PHProxy page appears, you've placed the folder in the correct location.

, If you just let PHProxy server run after installing it, anyone will be able to connect to it and use it, which is bad news. You can use Apache's "".htaccess"" function to create a username and password that will be required to access PHProxy.



Click here for detailed instructions on creating an .htaccess file.

, This is often the most complicated step, as it requires adjusting your router's settings, and the process varies from router to router. Ports control the flow of data into and out of your network. In order to connect to your server from another location, you'll need to open port 80 to allow incoming connections.



Click here for detailed instructions on opening ports.

You will need to know the IP address of your home computer when opening the port.

, This is the address that identifies your network on the internet, and you will use it to connect to your server from another location.


You can quickly determine your public IP address by opening Google on your home computer and typing my ip.

, Now that everything is configured and you know your home network's public IP address, you can connect to your proxy through any web browser.Type http://homeIPaddress/phproxy, replacing homeIPaddress with your home network's public IP address. Enter your username and password that you specified in the .htaccess file.
Once you load PHProxy in your browser, you can use it to access any blocked sites, including Facebook. Since you're connecting through your home computer, you can securely log in to any site that requires a username and password.

, You can configure a portable web browser to connect directly to your PHProxy server. This will allow you to use all of the browser functions without having to connect through the PHProxy website interface. A portable browser can be placed on a USB drive, which you can then plug into any computer to use.

Open your inbox.,
Find a past conversation with the friend in question.,
Look for a ""default"" profile picture and/or an un-clickable profile link.",How to Tell if Someone Has Blocked You or Deactivated Their Account on Facebook1," With this method, we'll determine whether or not we've been blocked by looking for clues in Facebook's built-in messaging service. To begin, open your Facebook inbox. After logging in, click the small icon in the top right of the window that resembles two speech bubbles. Click ""See All"" to access your inbox.


If you've recently communicated with this person, your conversation may be at or near the top of the drop-down menu that displays when you click on the messaging icon. In this case, you can click on your conversation to bring it up in a small chat box at the bottom of the window.
Note that this method requires you to have had a past conversation with your friend. If you haven't exchanged messages with the person in question over Facebook, you won't have a conversation history in which to look for clues.;
, When you've accessed your inbox, you'll want to find any past correspondence you've had with this friend. This can be a private one-on-one message or a group message that they replied to - all that's important is that they sent a message of their own as part of the conversation. Conversations that they read but did not reply to are unfortunately of no use.


If you can't find a conversation with your friend by scrolling through the list of conversations at the left of the inbox, you may want to try using the search bar at the top left to search your message history for your friend's name or other keywords.

, Every entry in your conversation history should have the poster's name and profile picture at the top of it. Look at one of your friend's entries - the condition of his or her name and profile picture can tell you whether you've been blocked or whether this person's profile has been deleted.


If your friend's profile picture is still visible, but his or her name is greyed out and cannot be clicked to access his or her profile, you have likely been blocked.
If, on the other hand, your friend's name isn't clickable, but his or her profile picture is set to the ""default"" Facebook picture (androgynous white silhouette against light blue backdrop), s/he has probably deleted his or her profile. The only alternative - that s/he blocked you and deleted his or her profile picture - is very unlikely.

If your friend's messages bear the name ""Facebook User"", rather than his or her actual name, s/he has definitely deleted his or her profile.

Verify that you cannot find your friend's profile on Facebook.,
Log out of Facebook.,
Perform a search for the Facebook profile of the individual.,
Try to find your friend's profile.",How to Tell if Someone Has Blocked You or Deactivated Their Account on Facebook2," This method uses your preferred online search engine (Google, Yahoo, etc.) to look for your friend's profile outside of Facebook. If you can find it outside of Facebook but not within Facebook, you'll know you've been blocked. Before starting, make sure your friend's profile can't be found on Facebook. Try searching their name in the search bar at the top of your profile and tagging them in your posts - if you can't seem to locate their profile or you get a ""Sorry, this page isn't available"" error screen when you click on a link to your profile, this is evidence that you've either been blocked or that your friend has disabled their profile - one or the other - so, proceed to the next steps.


Also, keep in mind that Facebook users occasionally change their names - usually just for laughs. If your friend has done this, you may not be able to find them with their real name, so try checking an old conversation in your inbox - if they've changed their name, this will be reflected here.

, Next, log out of your account. Click the downward-pointing arrow at the top right of your profile to display a drop-down window with several option. Click ""Log Out"" to log out of your account.


It's important to be logged out of your account because if you've been blocked and you stay logged in, you won't be able to view your friend's profile even if you can manage to find it with a search engine

, Now that you're logged out, go to Google (or the search engine of your choice) and search for your friend's profile. You'll probably want to use a search query like ""(Your friend's name) Facebook"" or something similar.


If you're getting ambiguous results, try including personal information like where the friend lived or went to school as keywords in your search. For instance, for a friend who grew up in Albuquerque and went to Yale, you might use a search query like ""Jane Doe Facebook Albuquerque Yale"" to narrow down your results.

, Given the fact that any person on Facebook is likely to share his or her name with several (if not thousands) of other users, it can be tricky to find your friend's profile while logged out. Do your best, using relevant keywords to narrow down your results. Based on the outcome of your search, it's usually fairly easy to tell whether you've been blocked:


If you can find your friend's profile on Google while logged out and it appears to be active and functioning, but you can't find them on Facebook when you are logged in, they've probably blocked you.
If, on the other hand, you can't find your friend's profile on Facebook while logged in and you can't find it on Google while logged out or you find what appears to be a deactivated or broken link to their account on Google, they've probably removed their profile.

"

Find an old Facebook conversation with your friend.,
Report the user.,
Look for ""Blocked"" on the next window.",How to Tell if Someone Has Blocked You or Deactivated Their Account on Facebook3," This method uses the ability to report spam or abuse on Facebook's messaging service to determine whether or not you've been blocked in a roundabout way. To begin, access your inbox and find an old conversation you've had with your friend. If you don't have any conversations with this friend, you won't be able to report your conversation, so you're better off with another method.


Though you're unlikely to create any serious repercussions for your friend by reporting him or her for spam (especially if s/he has done nothing wrong), doing so is rather disingenuous and could create further tensions with a person who's deliberately blocked you, so use this method with caution.
You'll want to use one-on-one conversations with the friend you suspect of blocking you, rather than group conversations that the user was a part of, for this method.

, When you're viewing your old conversation, click the ""Actions"" tab at the top of the window. Select ""Report Spam or Abuse"". Select the third option in the pop-up window, ""Report conversation participant(s) for harassing..."" and click the Okay button.


Again, it bears mentioning that reporting someone can easily be perceived as aggressive or petty, so avoid using this method for people with who you have a valued relationship.

, After you report this person, a confirmation window will pop up displaying his or her name, picture, and the words ""Blocked"" or ""Report"".


If you see ""Blocked"" next to your friend's name, you've been blocked.
If you see ""Report"" next to your friend's name, your friend has probably deleted his or her profile.
Again, note that with this method, you run the risk, however small, of opening your friend's account up to disciplinary action from Facebook, so use it only as a last resort.

Find a VPN service that fits your needs.,
Check that the VPN you want works in China.,
Download any necessary software.,
Connect to your VPN.,
Visit Facebook.",How to Successfully Access Facebook in China1," A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is an encrypted connection to a remote server that allow you to access the internet from behind restrictive firewalls. VPNs affect all of your internet traffic, which means Skype and other messaging services are not stuck behind the firewall either. VPNs are not free, but some offer monthly plans as opposed to yearly fee, which can be very useful for travelers.
;
, Some of the major VPN servers have been blocked by the Chinese government and are no longer accessible. Check with the company that you are signing up with and read reviews of the service online.

, Some VPN services will provide you with a VPN client that needs to be installed on your computer. Others will provide you connection information that you can enter into Windows’ or Mac’s connection manager.


Ideally, you should download and install your VPN software before you visit China. Many of the popular VPN programs are blocked, preventing you from signing up or downloading any clients. Setting your VPN up outside of China will make it easier to contact customer support if there are any issues.
Some VPN services offer mobile apps that you can use on your iPhone, iPad, or Android device.

, Either run the client, or enter your VPN information into your operating system’s connection settings. VPN clients that are provided with the service are already pre-configured and only require you to enter your login information.


For Windows, search for VPN on your computer and then select “Set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection” (Windows Vista/7) or “Add a VPN connection” (Windows 8). Enter your connection information. Your VPN service should have provided you with a server to connect to, as well as a username and password. Enter these into the VPN connection settings
For Mac OS X, click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. Click on Network. Click the Add (+) button at the bottom of the list, and then select VPN from the list of options. Choose the type of VPN you are connecting to. This will be provided by your VPN service. Enter your VPN settings, including the server you are connecting to and your username and password.
Click Connect to connect to your VPN. Most VPNs should connect automatically. If you cannot establish a connection, contact your VPN’s support service to troubleshoot the problem.

, Once your VPN is connected, you can visit any of the blocked sites that weren't previously accessible, as well as use any other internet-enabled programs such as Skype. You may notice a slow connection, but this is normal due to the distance between yourself and the VPN server.

Try free proxies.,
Try a secure proxy.",How to Successfully Access Facebook in China2," A proxy is a website, often based in a different location than you, that will let you access other sites through it. So if your proxy is in the USA, and you access Facebook through it, it should be like accessing Facebook in the USA. Here is a list of free proxies for you to try. You should try them first, because why pay - but you may find they're not a great solution to access Facebook in China because:


China keeps finding and blocking them too.
They often don't have good enough programming to handle the technology of social media

, The one I've used which works well for Facebook and other social media is Proxy Center. They have a free trial so you can make sure that it will work for you before you pay anything, or even give them your email. Benefit of a proxy like this (as opposed to a VPN, which we talked about in the previous step) is that there's nothing to install on your computer - it's all web-based.

Download the Tor browser bundle.,
Run the browser.,
Check that you are connected.",How to Successfully Access Facebook in China3," Tor is a free distributed network that keeps you anonymous while you while you are connected through the browser. Information is bounced between a large number of relays that exist all over the globe. Tor allows you to bypass any firewalls or restrictions placed on your connection. The drawback is that websites load slowly, as the data has to travel great distances to reach you.


The Tor browser bundle is a self-contained program that does not need to be installed. You can place it onto a USB drive and plug it into any computer. The browser bundle is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

, The Tor browser is a modified version of Firefox, and shares a lot of interface similarities with it. When you run the browser program, a window will appear showing the status of the Tor connection. Once the connection is established, the browser will open.


Only traffic sent through the Tor browser will be sent through the Tor network. That means that Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, or any other browser will not be anonymous through the Tor network while Tor is running.

, Once the browser window opens, you should see a page confirming that you are successfully connected to Tor. You should now be able to access sites that were previously blocked. Closing the browser window will stop Tor from running


While data in the Tor network is encrypted, it cannot decrypt data leaving the Tor network. That means that any secure transactions that you need to make are just as vulnerable as they are on the regular internet. Only give out personal information to sites with SSL enabled. You will see HTTPS:// instead of HTTP:// and your browser address field will display a security lock.

Know what a hashtag is.,
Understand what a hashtag does.,
Make a list of sites on which you can use hashtags.,
Consider your own reasons for wanting to hashtag.,
Don't use spaces or punctuation in hashtags.,
Keep your hashtags short.,
Make sure your hashtags are relevant.,
Use pre-existing hashtags.,
Try not to use too many hashtags in one post.,
Open your social media account of choice.,
Create a new post.,
Type in your hashtag.,
Publish your post.,
Click other people's hashtags.",How to Use Hashtags," A hashtag is a word or phrase constructed after a pound sign (#). Hashtags serve to categorize a post so that when a site use clicks on or searches for your specific hashtag, they can view any posts associated with the tag.

For example, taking a picture of your food and writing ""#meatloaf"" would potentially add your photo to your chosen website's collection of meatloaf-based posts.;
, When you add a hashtag to a post, other people will be able to see that post if they search for that hashtag. This means that finding often-searched hashtags and using them in related posts will likely increase the number of people who can interact with that post., Since hashtags serve the same purpose on every site that supports them, using them becomes a matter of choice of website rather than function. Some popular sites include the following:Twitter
Instagram
Facebook
Tumblr
Pinterest
Google+
YouTube

, Some possible uses include the following:


Marketing - Use your brand name, catch-phrase, or a product's name (or all three) as hashtags to promote a marketing post.

Joining a trend - If your favorite social media platform has a public dialogue based around a trend, adding your opinion with the trend's hashtag (e.g., ""#election"") will give you a chance to have your voice heard.

Increasing post audience - As mentioned previously, hashtags increase the likelihood that people you don't know will see your post. Especially on Instagram, adding hashtags to your posts will increase the number of people who ""like"" or comment on them.

, Since you'll use spaces to differentiate between hashtags, all of the words in your hashtags will be clumped together. The same logic applies to punctuation, so never use any apostrophes, dashes, or underscores.

For example, the hashtagged version of the phrase ""I like trains"" would read #iliketrains.

, The longer your hashtag is, the less likely it is to be discovered., Posting a picture of an old phone with the hashtag ""#iphone8"" or something similarly misleading may be humorous, but it can also get your account suspended for spam., Most social media accounts have a list of currently trending hashtags displayed somewhere on the home page (Twitter, for example, displays trending hashtags on the left side of the home page on the desktop site), though you can also use hashtags from product ads or follow your friends' examples., Depending on the social media account, the metric for ""too much"" will vary (Instagram hovers at around 30 per post, while Twitter should only contain a few). If your post is 90 percent hashtag, there's very little room left for substantive commentary--which, after all, is the point of hashtagging., Since hashtags function similarly on all supported platforms, the account you choose is really up to you.

Keep in mind that hashtagged posts on private accounts won't show up in public searches.

, Remember that you'll want to make sure the post is relevant to the hashtag you plan on using.

On Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube, your hashtags will go in the description area below your visual post (e.g., the photo or video).
Tumblr posts require hashtags to go in a separate section of the post (not the body). You'll see a tag section at the bottom of the ""New Post"" template.
You can also use hashtags while commenting on most posts.

, To do so, you'll type a # sign, then type in the word or phrase you wish to hashtag without any spaces or punctuation., The hashtag will turn into a clickable link in your post. Now your post is discoverable by people searching for that hashtag., Doing so will take you to your selected hashtags' pages, where you can view the public discussion occurring around said hashtags."

Peruse his profile first.,
Keep it casual.,
Try being straightforward.,
Ask him about himself.,
Use open-ended questions.,
Focus on common interests.,
Try an usual word as a greeting.",How to Start a Conversation with a Guy on Facebook2," Like starting a conversation for dating, you should always check out his profile for common ground, even if you're trying to become friends. If it doesn't have public information, ask him about it., If you just want a friend, you don't want to send a signal that you want something more.In other words, don't flirt. You don't want to comment it on his cute eyes if you just want to be friends.

, Say why you're contacting the person and what you want: ""Hi, my name is Jake, and I'm looking for new friends in the area."", People like to talk about themselves, so ask him about what he likes and who he is.As an example, you could say, ""Hi, I noticed your profile today, and I found it interesting. Can you tell me more about yourself?""

, When beginning a conversation, open-ended questions (questions that require more than a ""yes"" or ""no"" to answer) encourage the conversation to continue.For example, instead of asking ""Do you like books?"" ask him ""What kind of books do you like to read?""

, For instance, if you both like basketball, focus on that.For instance, you could say, ""Hi, I'm Ashley. I see you love playing basketball. I love to shoot hoops, too. Did you play for your high school or college team?""

, That is, use ""howdy"" or ""what's up?"" as opposed to ""hi"" or ""hello."" Studies done by OkCupid show a person is more likely to respond to an unusual word."

Look at his profile first.,
Focus on your connections.,
Ask about the person's job.,
Tie the question to his location.,
Be straightforward about what you want.",How to Start a Conversation with a Guy on Facebook3," It's always important to have as many details as you can before starting a conversation with someone you don't know well. See where he works, what he does for a living, and where he lives. You can also look for common ground, such as similar interests or the fact that you both have two cats., That is, if you are contacting person because he's a friend of a friend or because someone he knows recommended you chat, bring it up.As an example, you could say, ""I'm writing to you because Jeff Grace of ABC Financials suggested I get in touch with you.""

, If you notice the person works in a similar field, ask about the job he does.For instance, you could say, ""Hi, I'm Jess. I notice you also work in engineering. I'm new to the field, so I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about your job.""

, That is, tie in your location to initiate the conversation.You could say, ""Hi, I'm Beca. I'm new in Phoenix, and I was wondering if you have some time to talk about jobs in computer science in this area.""

, If you're looking to make connections, mention that. If you're trying to find places that are hiring, ask about that. Most people are willing to help if you state what you want.For example, you could say, ""Hi, I'm new to the area, and I'm looking to make professional connections in my field. Do you mind chatting with me for a few minutes?""

Always ask if the person has time to chat.,
Back off if the person doesn't want to chat.,
Check your grammar.,
Stop trying to initiate conversation if he doesn't respond.",How to Start a Conversation with a Guy on Facebook4," That is, make sure you're not interrupting anything. People may respond to you but not really have time for a drawn-out chat., If the person makes it clear that he doesn't want to chat now, ask if you can chat in the future. If he says no, respect his wishes.

, Most people are turned off by bad grammar. Also, if you're over 20, avoid using ""netspeak,"" such as ""u"" for ""you"" or ""r"" for ""are."", If you send a couple of messages and he doesn't respond, stop trying to initiate conversation, especially if your messages are marked ""read"" by the messenger.

Sending a private message will make it easier for an actual conversation to develop since both of you will likely feel more comfortable being yourselves when no one else can enter the discussion.;
, The only time you should focus your efforts on the public realm is when you have something meaningful to contribute to an existing conversation currently happening on some portion of her public profile.Make sure that you're actually adding to the conversation in a meaningful, non-controversial manner. Avoid disagreeing with her in a way that could cause an argument and create a negative impression, and wait for a relatively lighthearted topic. For instance, if she makes an open request for opinions on which phone she should upgrade to, you could give her your opinion and provide reasoning to back your answer.

, Even if you've looked at all of her photos from the past five years, you shouldn't let her know that—at least not initially. As a general rule, only like or remark on content that she's posted within the last month to avoid seeming like a Facebook stalker.


You may need to adjust this time frame based on how often the girl updates her Facebook page. If she updates a dozen times each day, you should probably stick with content she's posted within the last week. On the other hand, if she only updates once a month, it might be appropriate to remark on content she's posted within the last several months.

, Starting one conversation may not be enough. Usually, you'll need to continually make an effort to stay in touch before she becomes interested enough to contact you first.By making an effort more than once, you're demonstrating a continued, more genuine interest in her.
Persistence is good, but you should avoid obsession. Starting a new conversation every few hours or every day can be overwhelming, so give her some time to breathe in between your messages.
Don't continually bug her for a response, either. If she doesn't want to reply to your message, complaining about it won't make her change her mind.

, If you aren't already friends with the girl, you should converse with her for a little while before sending her a friend request. She may not accept requests from strangers, but she'll be more likely to accept the request once she gets to know you.


After you've had a few conversations, ask her if she's okay with you sending a friend request. Getting her approval can demonstrate a high degree of respect, and she'll likely appreciate the gesture.

, Opening with a question can work out well, but you should stick with open questions rather than asking closed ones. Closed questions can be answered with a “yes” or “no,” but open questions require a more detailed reply. As such, open questions can lead into conversation more easily.


For example, you might try asking about her name.If it's an uncommon name, you could ask about the name itself: “Isla is a lovely name. Do you know what its origins are or what it means?”
If it's a common name, you'll have to make the question more personal: ""I've always liked the name Rachel. Were you named after anyone, or do your parents just have really great taste in names?""
Note that in both examples, the remark opens with a compliment before leading into the question. This isn't strictly necessary, but using both a compliment and a question often creates a more powerful opening line.



, Figure out if you have anything in common with this girl, even if it's something relatively small and inconsequential. Remarking on this common interest creates an immediate connection, which could put her on friendly terms with you.If you have any shared friends on Facebook, you could use that shared connection to start the conversation. For example: “I noticed you're friends with Alex. How did the two of you meet? I've known him since I was kid, and we even grew up in the same neighborhood.”
Similarly, if you know the girl in real life, you could use your shared experiences in reality. For instance: “You're in Mrs. Smith's fifth period algebra class, right? I'm in her eighth period class. What do you think of her class?”

, Recent events provide a shortcut to common ground since they impact or interest a wide range of people. Try to narrow down your topic to something happening on a local level, though, and zero in on something she might actually have an interest in.


If possible, narrow it down to something happening in your most intimately shared community. If she lives on the other side of the state, talk to her about something happening in the state. If she lives in your city or neighborhood, skip the statewide news and mention something happening in your specific community.
Keep in mind that not every girl will be interested in every local topic. For instance, she may not care about the sort of season your city's team is having if she has no interest in the sport they play. If her public profile indicates that she's a fan, though, talking about the season could be a great way to open the conversation.

, If she's holding something in her profile picture or in another recent photograph, make a remark or ask a question about that object. In doing so, you're letting her know that you pay attention to the small details, which demonstrates a greater degree of sincerity and interest.Get creative. If she's sitting in a coffee shop and holding a coffee cup, you might ask her what she's drinking. If she's wearing a peculiar necklace, you might compliment the piece and ask her where she got them, under the pretense that you're looking for a gift for your sister (assuming you actually have a sister, of course).

, A little flattery can help your cause, but only if you're clever about it. Avoid general and overused compliments. When possible, remark on some less notable detail that you sincerely find appealing.


Compliments on obvious features, like tattoos or hairstyles, can seem insincere even when you really mean what you're saying. Highly noticeable features are complimented more often, so the person complimenting those features will stand out less.
Avoid overly sexual compliments, too. In other words, don't open the conversation with a compliment about her chest, hips, or backside.
Try complimenting her about the finer details: her outfit, her name, her interests, and so on. Personalized compliments almost always work better than general ones.

, It isn't always easy to learn about a girl's interests and personality through Facebook, especially if you aren't actually friends yet. Making an effort to address her as a thinking, feeling human being will usually work to your benefit, though, and will usually be more effective than fixating on her appearance.


Keep this tip in mind when utilizing the other “opening line” suggestions. For instance, the girl in question might have a stunning smile, beautiful eyes, and gorgeous hair. If she's holding a copy of Pride and Prejudice in her profile picture, though, that book is the detail you'll want to address. By remarking on the book she's holding, you're demonstrating interest in her likes and personality, which will give her a much more positive and lasting impression of you.

, As trite as it may sound, you should be yourself when starting and maintaining the conversation. Don't try to be someone you're not in the hopes of impressing her. False facades are hard to maintain, and once it falls apart, she may lose interest or become wary of you.


Starting the conversation as your real self will make the conversation easier to maintain. Returning to an earlier example, you may not want to comment on the coffee cup she's holding if you hate coffee, or the book she's holding if you don't enjoy reading. If you start a conversation on something that doesn't genuinely interest you, you won't have much to say, and the conversation will end quickly.

, In simple terms: don't be perverse, rude, or vulgar. Any girl with an iota of self-respect won't tolerate that sort of behavior. Play the part of the polite gentleman if you want her to respond to you in a positive manner.


Don't treat the girl like an object, curse at her when she doesn't respond the way you'd like her to respond, or turn the conversation to sex before any mutual attraction and romantic interest has been established. Being respectful encompasses more than just these three points, but minding these basic manners will at least be a good start.

, You can open the conversation with a joke to break the ice, but the wrong joke can start the conversation on an excruciatingly bad note. Humor doesn't always shine through when you're communicating digitally, so it's usually best to save it for when she gets a better understanding of your personality and sense of humor.


If you do decide to open with a joke, stick with something safe. An obviously cheesy joke can work out well, and mildly self-deprecating humor might make her chuckle, too. Avoid off-color humor or jokes that can be easily misinterpreted, though.

, Opening a conversation by talking about your good points will only make you look egotistical. As the conversation progresses, the girl will likely ask you questions about yourself, and that's when you should start opening up about the details of your own life.


On a similar note, don't talk and behave as though you're “God's gift to women.” Even if you're the most charming guy alive, no woman is obligated to develop an interest in you. Try your best, but don't blame or insult the girl if it doesn't work out.

, Even if you're hoping to pursue some sort of relationship with this girl, you shouldn't start the conversation by asking her out. In fact, you should probably wait until you've gotten to know her over the course of several conversations before moving to that stage.


As a general rule, you should wait until some mutual level of chemistry has been established. If and when you ask her out, do so as casually as possible. You don't even have to call it a “date”—saying that you'd like to meet up and hang out in person is usually the best way to go.

, Don't ask her about other guys when you send her that first message. If you obsess too much about the other guys talking to her and appearing in her photos, you'll probably scare her off.


Only ask her about the other guys in her life if you can do so naturally and as part of another topic. For instance, you could ask her about how she knows a mutual friend who happens to be male or ask her about the mixed group of friends she went to a concert with. The key here is to keep the conversation about her and her experiences while making the identity of the guy a secondary concern.

Understand this trick.,
Open your web browser.,
Navigate to your profile.,
View the source code.,
Use the webpage search function.,
Look at the list of profiles.,
See who each profile belongs to.,
Look up a specific profile.",How to See Who You are Most Connected to on Facebook2," This trick will give you insight into who views your profile, but Facebook isn't confirming exactly who they are. This list that Facebook keeps is determined by a variety of factors: who comments on your posts, who you message frequently, who looks at your Facebook the most often, and more.


There is no way to see JUST who looks at your page the most, and any app which says that it can tell you that is lying and a scam.
You'll have to learn how to interpret the list that this trick gives you. For example, look out for people showing up towards the top of the list who you know you don't message and you don't comment on their stuff. If someone you never interact with shows up pretty high on your list, you'll know it's because they're looking at your page.

, You will need one which allows you to view the source code for a website. Google Chrome is one of the easiest browsers to perform this trick with. You cannot do this from mobile browsers or the Facebook app; you will need a browser on a computer.

, You will be looking at the source code for your profile. You can quickly access it by logging into Facebook and then clicking on your name in the upper-left corner underneath your profile image.

, If you are using Google Chrome, right-click the background and choose ""View page source"". You can also use the Ctrl+U shortcut (⌘ Cmd+U on a Mac). Other browsers usually have this option under the ""View"" menu.

, You can search the source code by pressing Ctrl+F (⌘ Cmd+F on a Mac). This tool will search all of the text on any given page for the term you type in. Type InitialChatFriendsList into the Find box.

, The numbers which immediately follow are the identification numbers of the profiles of your friends. You will see a string of numbers, each set in quotations and followed by ""-0"", ""-2"", or ""-3"". Copy the string without the - and the final number. Paste this after the "".com/"" when looking at the main Facebook page. This will bring up the profile so you know who it belongs to.

, Copy the string from the source code, omitting the ""-X"" from the end of the number. For example, if the first person on the list is ""1111111-2"", copy ""1111111"" to your clipboard. Open a new Facebook page and paste this number at the end of the address. Using the above example, the address would look like ""www.facebook.com/1111111"". Press ↵ Enter to load the page and find out who's profile it is.

, To do this, you will need to look up the person's profile ID number. The easiest way to find this is to open a picture that the person has uploaded, and then try the various numbers that appear in the address bar. One of these will be the profile ID.


Once you know the profile ID, you can use the Find tool to see where that ID appears in the list. The closer it is to the top, the more connected you are to that person.

, Before contacting the police, contact Facebook and let them know what is happening. Ask to speak to Facebook's fraud department so you can report the fraud.Ask Facebook to freeze your account until the fraud has been resolved.
Be sure you reset any passwords and usernames that may have been compromised.

, If you have any financial information on your Facebook account, including credit card numbers and bank account numbers, you will need to contact those entities to inform them of the breach.


Call TransUnion at (800) 680-7289, Equifax at (800) 525-6285, or Experian at (888) 397-3742 and request a fraud alert on your credit report. This alerts the bureaus of possible identity theft and prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name. This service is free of charge.Call your bank and make sure there is no unusual activity on your accounts. Also, change your online banking login information in case the identity theft gained access through Facebook.

, Police are more likely to pursue your case if you can identify the person who has stolen your identity. Due to the high degree of anonymity on the internet, investigating identity theft is difficult. However, as several United States criminal cases have shown, perpetrators are sometimes prosecuted for identity theft.If someone is pretending to be you online and hurting your reputation, it is likely that the perpetrator is someone you know, rather than an anonymous scam artist.
Police typically do not treat identity theft the same way they treat traditional crimes. This is because perpetrators of identity theft work through the internet and are usually located across jurisdictional boundaries from their victims.For this reason, police are unlikely to pursue your case if you cannot identify a perpetrator who lives in their jurisdiction.

, Take screenshots of the fake profile and of any messages or comments you can find where the perpetrator has impersonated you. Document the web address and any photographs of you that the impersonator has uploaded to the profile.


Carefully document any activity that can harm your reputation or career. For example, a woman prosecuted for posing as her ex-boyfriend online posted comments stating that he had a sexually-transmitted disease and used drugs.Also keep copies of any communications (emails, texts, or voicemails) from the perpetrator about the identity theft. If you have a message where the imposter admits to creating a fake profile, you can use it as evidence.

, Call your local police department and explain the details of your situation. Understand that the police are unlikely to pursue the case unless you can tell them who the imposter is and demonstrate that you have been harmed by the identity theft. If the police are interested in pursuing your case, they will instruct you on how to provide additional information.


When you contact the police, be sure you have already filled out an FTC Identity Theft Affidavit and have a copy of the FTC Memo to Law Enforcement.The Identity Theft Affidavit will give law enforcement information about your identity and in what ways you think it was compromised. The FTC Memo instructs law enforcement on how to handle identity theft cases in order to make sure you get the help you need.

Make sure that your raffle meets Facebook's guidelines.,
Figure out the desired target market.,
Determine the goal of your raffle.,
Choose a prize that's relevant to your brand.,
Create the rules for the raffle.,
Determine the entry methods for the raffle.",How to Raffle on Facebook1," You can't create a promotion or raffle on a personal Facebook Timeline, so you'll need to create an official Page on Facebook. Also, you'll have to write a disclaimer that explains that Facebook is not associated with the promotion. Raffles must also have their own eligibility requirements and rules and cannot give away firearms, alcohol, tobacco, or adult products.To get the full list of restrictions and guidelines on Facebook promotions, visit https://www.facebook.com/page_guidelines.php#promotionsguidelines.;
, Think of the type of people who you think would want the prize offered in the raffle. If you have a diverse market of people who buy your products or services, choose a subset of specific people within your customer base. Targeting specific age groups or people with particular interests will increase the number of individuals who feel compelled to enter.For example, if you are running a raffle for a new toy, you'll want to adjust the advertising to children or the parents that will purchase the toy for their children.
Look at the analytics for past advertising campaigns to get an understanding for the type of people who previously clicked similar ads., The raffle should have a positive outcome for your business. This could include increased exposure for a new product or service you're launching, growing your email list, or getting new customers through word of mouth. Figure out what you want the goal of the raffle to be so that you can incorporate it into your raffle as you create it., You don't want to choose just anything for your prize. Good prizes include a free product or service from your company, a gift card for your products or services, or a partner company's product or service. People are usually more interested in the prize rather than the company running the raffle, so choosing a relevant prize will remind entrants of your company and increase your exposure., You must have the rules of the raffle posted somewhere that's accessible to the entrants. Rules for promotional Facebook raffles typically include eligibility restrictions, the duration of the raffle, the prize that the winner will receive, terms and conditions, and any restrictions that exist.In the text of the raffle post itself, make sure to leave a link to the full rules and regulations.
If you are running a raffle for a company, make sure to refer to your manager or the legal department before trying to formulate the rules and regulations yourself.
If you are having trouble writing up your own rules and regulations, find another raffles rules and regulations and use it as a template to fill out all of the information.

, Common entry methods for promotions on Facebook include liking the post, sharing the post, tagging a friend, commenting, filling out a form on an external website, or submitting a photograph. Determine which way you'd like contestants to be able to enter. Keep in mind that the harder it is to register for the raffle, the fewer people will likely sign up."

Make a backup account and make that account an admin also.,
Create a folder for important info such as travel logs, tour or event dates, or writings.,
Exercise self restraint: uploading too much or too often is considered abusing one Facebook applications.,
Tag a few people in crucial shots so that they know the photos are there.,
Keep the tagging to just several at a time.,
Spread the word -- about anything!",How to Recover Quickly from a Facebook Ban," This way if you are deleted, you still have control over your pages.


Back-up your albums, even if your soul purpose for your Facebook account is to share photos. The photos once re-sized to Facebook quality take up little room. It might be more than worth it to save your photos on another site or on your computer in folders of 60 (or however big your albums are), just as you have them on your Facebook account. Then to re-upload it's as easy as select all and upload, but if you have a slow connection, it is a pain.
This is handled by having two separate accounts with a different name and email address and such. This helps, if you have other interests like a life besides activism. For instance, one could create an account solely for political protesting, and another more personal account for backpacking, travel and contacts. It might seem silly to go to such an extent, but this way your personal photos and travel memories are safe from deletion if your activism account goes.;
, It might also help to copy-paste your 'info' somewhere, maybe just to your new account. Hold off on inviting friends to the new account until your current account is deleted to save on confusion.

, To be safe -- do no more than 2 albums a day, and no more than 4 a week.

, Then let your friends do the rest. It's part of the fun!

, One of the things you are likely to get nailed for is tagging. Facebook sees it as a form of spamming if you go through album after album and tag every photo.

, It has played a key role in gathering the people, as an amazing tool. But, you could just forget Facebook altogether. However, it is the biggest and most used social networking tool out there today.

Post often.,
Post the right content.,
Post the right amount of content.,
Create a Facebook contest.,
Use the Page Insights feature.,
Create a community.",How to Make Your Facebook Page Famous1," Facebook uses algorithms to decide when and how often content shows up in other people’s feeds. Because of the way these algorithms are constructed, most of your content will get the most interaction shortly after its published. Frequently posting from your Page ensures that you’ll show up in other people’s feeds regularly., You shouldn’t post just anything in order to increase the frequency of your posts. The FB algorithm prioritizes Pages with media over pages and posts with plain text. Posting interactive media gives your Page’s update a better chance of showing up in your followers’ timelines more often., You should divide your posts roughly in half by content that is purely interactive and content that connects them to you more directly. This helps you avoid inundating your followers with requests for them to support you directly and instead keeps them interested in the Page itself.


Some good examples of interactive content are Facebook questions (where your followers can answer), memes, pictures, and videos. You shouldn’t use just any example of these types of content, though. They should all relate to the values of your company or brand.
Blog posts, infographics, tutorials, and event invitations or announcements are good examples of content that connects your followers with you more directly., An easy way to generate traffic for your Facebook Page is to host a Facebook contest. There are a lot of different ways to run a Facebook contest, but the easiest is to ask people to like or comment on your post to be entered.Facebook has some guidelines for using the site for contests, so make sure you’re following them.Facebook does not permit you to use personal timelines for contests, which basically means you can’t ask your followers to share something to enter (or get additional entries).

, If you have a Facebook Page, you’ll get a free Facebook Insights Page. The Insights Page can tell you a lot about who looks at your page, when, and for how long. This can help you to tailor your content and the timing of your posts to reach the most people possible., If you really want to make your Facebook Page famous, you have to make followers feel connected – getting them to interact with your content isn’t enough. Reply to your followers’ messages and posts in a timely manner (within 24 hours, if you can) and make sure that the content you share reflects the beliefs and views of your Page."

Embed plug-ins on your website.,
Share your Facebook Page name on your print media.",How to Make Your Facebook Page Famous2," If you have a personal Facebook in addition to your Page, be sure to regularly link to your Page from your personal timeline. This reminds your friends that you have that Page, and if they like or share content from it, their friends will see it, too., Facebook ads are not free, but people who have used them regularly claim that they can increase traffic to their Page in such a way that the ads basically pay for themselves. Creating ads can be pretty time intensive, though, so make sure you’re committed to this before you try it.You’ll need to consider what type of editing software you want to use for the ad, what your target audience is, how much you’re willing to spend, and what you want the ad to say. Facebook will ask you to input all of this information in the Ads Manager for your page., If you want your Facebook Page to become famous, you can’t just promote in on Facebook! Use other social media – Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram – to share your Page.


Linking to specific Facebook content – a contest, a video, a photo – can help generate traffic for that particular post.
You can also include your Facebook Page information in your other social media profiles by linking to it in your Twitter or Instagram bio. This gets more people to your Page in general., A good way to expose your Page to more people is by asking the followers you already have to share the Page. You can do this by promoting certain hashtags related to your current content, or asking followers to tag your Facebook Page in photos related to it (for example, if you hosted an event). This way you might be able to reach all of your followers’ followers., Most people who use social media to promote their businesses or websites or blogs are happy to help out other social media users. Share other Pages that you like or are interested in, and chances are they’ll share your Page right back.You can also make this arrangement more official by asking other Pages to do a share swap – specifically say “I’d love it if we could help each other out by sharing one another’s Pages! I’m willing to share two of your posts a week if you’re willing to share two of my posts a week. What do you think?”

, Some people might find your website – if you have one – before they find your Facebook Page. Embedding some of Facebook’s plug-ins on your website can help increase traffic to your Facebook Page and make it famous.


CTAs (calls to action) are a good place to start. A CTA plug-in allows your readers to like or follow your page with one click from your website.You can also integrate the comments feature using a plug-in on your website. This allows users to comment on a Facebook post about certain content right from your website, if you have one., You can also share your Facebook Page by kicking it old school. Make sure the url for your Facebook is printed on any hard copy media you have – posters, business cards, newsletters, etc. This way, even if someone hasn’t looked you up online, they still know how to find your Page on Facebook."

However, the default setting allows anyone to look you up who has your phone number or email address.Click the edit link to change this setting so that only people already on your friends list can look you up with your phone number or email address.
Additionally, you might want to use a separate email address for school or work contacts to eliminate the chance someone can look you up by your email address. This can be helpful if you're trying to hide your Facebook from potential employers.;
, On the same settings page where you edited who could look you up, you also have the option to remove your page from search engine results. The default allows your page to be found in search results.If you toggle this option off, your Facebook profile won't appear if someone searches your name on a public search engine such as Bing or Google.
Keep in mind this still won't keep people from looking you up within Facebook. The only way you can eliminate that is to either deactivate your account or make all of your posts and information visible only to you.

, Under your privacy settings, you have the ability to prevent random people from sending you messages or trying to add you as friends. However, the default setting here is that ""everyone"" can send you friend requests.Changing this to ""friends of friends"" gives you a little more control, because at least then the person has to be connected to you in some way before they can attempt to add you as a friend.

, Under the heading ""Connecting on Facebook,"" you can set all options to friends only. Read each of these options carefully before you change them, because this will give you the strictest possible privacy settings you can get on Facebook short of deactivating your account.However, switching all connections to friends only does give you the greatest amount of control over your profile. If you want to make it harder for people to find you on Facebook, this will enable you greater control over your privacy.

, No matter how tight your privacy settings are, you still can't control the privacy settings of your friends. That means that any time you interact with your friends, you can potentially be discovered by someone.To take care of this, go to your privacy settings and click on ""Info Accessible Through Your Friends."" This will let you see how much of your information is getting through your friends' more open security or privacy settings so you can act accordingly.

, Whether someone's harassing you, or you just no longer trust them having access to what you post, you can easily block their account so they will no longer be able to see your profile or interact with you.Simply go to your settings and click ""Blocking.""

Use an alternate name.",How to Make It Harder for People to Find You on Facebook2," Listing where you've worked, where you went to school, or where you've lived enables people to look you up using those entities. Deleting these entries means people won't be able to find you that way.For example, suppose you got married and took your partner's name. If you list your high school, it connects you to everyone else who went to your high school. From that page, someone from your high school class could find your profile by browsing the class members – even if they didn't know your new last name.
Likewise, anyone who happened to find your Facebook page could verify your identity by checking that information against the information they already knew about you, such as your hometown or your last employer.

, The settings on the content you post are one of the easiest ways to control who can find you on Facebook and what people not on your friends list can see of your content.From your account settings, adjust the default privacy of your posts and photos so that they are only visible to friends.
You also can create lists that you can choose so some of your content is only visible to some of the people on your friends list. This could be helpful if, for example, you want to post photos of your family but only want them to be visible to other family members.
You also can adjust the privacy of specific posts from the bottom corner of the post box as you post them. If you make a mistake, you can go back and change it.

, Even if you've adjusted your default privacy setting for future photos, the settings on your old photos will remain the same unless you go back through and change those as well.You can do this manually, but that may be time-consuming if you've uploaded a lot of photos. The other option is to go to your privacy settings. Under ""Who can see my stuff"" you'll see an option to ""limit the audience for posts you've shared with friends of friends or public."" You can select ""limit old posts"" and it will change the privacy settings of old posts you may have posted as public in the past.

, When someone tags you in a photo, or in a post, that tag is now visible to your friends, their friends, and anyone else with whom they've shared that photo or post. This means if they've posted something publicly, you are now tagged in a public post that anyone on the internet can see.Open the timeline and tagging section of your settings and edit the setting that allows you to review tags before they appear on Facebook. When someone tags you, Facebook will send you a notification. You can review the tag and the privacy setting of the post and determine whether you want it to appear. If you don't, you can simply deny it.
You also can manage the people, in addition to those already tagged, who will see the tag.

, If you don't want to ""check in"" to a location to let your friends know where you are, the solution is simple – don't click the button to check in to that location. However, you may want to disable the feature that allows your friends to check you into a location without your permission.This can be done under the timeline and tagging section of your settings. Anyone who attempts to check you in will appear in your timeline review, and you'll have to approve the check-in before it goes live on Facebook.

, If you want to make it extremely difficult for anyone who knows you to find you on Facebook, you may want to take the additional step of changing your name. If you want to act conservatively, you could simply use your middle name as your last name.You also can create something wholly original that isn't connected to your name. Just be careful not to make it too ridiculous. Don't change it to anything you might be embarrassed by if your page was discovered by professional colleagues or family.
Keep in mind that when you change your name, you will still be searchable by your real name for a brief period of time. So if you want to hide your Facebook page in anticipation of a particular event or meeting, make sure you give yourself enough time.

Get login notifications.,
Create a complicated password.,
Change your password regularly.,
Enable two-factor authentication.,
Check your connected apps.,
Deny targeted advertising.",How to Make It Harder for People to Find You on Facebook3," Under your account's security, you can request notifications whenever anyone logs in to your account. Getting these notifications can alert you if your account has been breached by a hacker, so you can take precautions to minimize the damage.The notification will provide a date, time, and location of the access on your account, so you can determine whether it was you or someone else. For example, if you log on to your account at school, you would get a notification of that log on when you logged into your account later at home.

, If you have a simple password that anyone could guess, it may be time to change it to something more complex. Your password should be a lengthy series of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.You can change your password under general settings.

, Keeping hackers from accessing your profile also means changing your password every few months or so, just to be on the safe side. You should do this even if you have no reason to suspect anyone has accessed your account., With two-factor authentication (or ""Login Approvals,"" as Facebook calls it), you'll receive a text message with a code when you enter your username and password to log in to Facebook.The text message includes a code that you must enter before you can access your Facebook account. This makes your account more secure because even if your password is hacked, the hacker still must somehow get your phone as well.

, If you use a lot of apps with Facebook, you should check every few months and see what permissions those apps have. Some of their default settings allow you to post on your profile or access all of your information.Go to your app settings under your account settings, and you can review the permissions each app has. If you don't agree with the information that is shared with the app, you can always remove it.
Change the privacy settings to ""only me,"" and then anything the app posts will only be visible to you, not to any of your friends or to the general public.

, Targeted advertising looks at your Facebook and general browser activity to figure out what you're interested in so relevant ads will be placed on your feed. If you don't want advertisers to have access to all this information about you, you can deny targeted advertising.You also can decide whether your friends are able to see products or services you like. For example, if you like a page on the internet using the Facebook ""like"" button, or if you like a company's Facebook page, when those things show up on a friend's Facebook feed it will say that you liked it. You can turn this off if you wish for a little more privacy.

Interact with others on public pages.",How to Make a Fake Facebook Page Seem Real," When coming up with a name, put yourself into the shoes of someone who’s choosing a name for their baby. Imagine a first and last name that sound great together. Unique, but not too out there!


Names cannot include numbers, symbols, strange capitalization, repeating characters, or strange punctuation as per Facebook’s Guidelines.Be careful with using names from popular movies or television, as they might sound too obvious (e.g. “Brad Pitt” or “Jennifer Lopez”). Instead, choose a first name from one star and a last name from another, like Brad Lopez or Jennifer Pitt!;
, If you leave the profile photo blank, nobody will believe the account is real. The trouble is, stealing other peoples’ photos is illegal—if the person in the photo (or the photographer) finds out that you’re using their photo without permission, you could face legal trouble.Try these ideas instead:


Take a selfie, but use enough filters to make yourself look unrecognizable.
Use a cool nature photo, like a sunset or underwater scene.
Animals! Everyone loves cute animal photos.

Take a screenshot from a movie, music video, or cartoon.

, People may look at your profile to try to figure out who you are. When choosing a hometown, current location, employer, and education, the details should be realistic.


Choose a hometown and/or current city that you know well and can talk about. This is especially important if you intent to join a Facebook group for a particular region.
Make sure your age works with your job and education! If your profile says you’re 18, don’t say you have a law degree from Yale and work for the FBI.
If you’re just signing up to play games or follow news, don’t worry about filling out your profile, liking pages, or adding friends. As long as your name and photo look real, you’re good to go!

, If you’ll be interacting with other people, expect them to check your timeline for hints on kind of things you post, how long you’ve been posting them, and whether anyone else interacts with you.


If your profile is brand new but you want people to know you’re not new to Facebook, post something like “I’m back on Facebook” or “Time to start fresh.”

Share YouTube videos, popular memes, and news articles. Add a comment to anything you share, even if it’s goofy. For example, “This video cracked me up,” or “I can’t believe this really happened!”

, You’ll find this button at the top of pages for products, media personalities, celebrities, restaurants, and virtually anything else. People who view your profile will see a list of all of your “likes” and use that information to get a sense of who you are.If you prefer, you can just hide the whole “Likes” section of your profile.

, Without a few friends to start with, potential new friends and groups may think you look suspicious.


Find new friends by visiting Facebook pages for movies, celebrities, or political ideas. When you find someone you want to add, click their name, and then click Add Friend.
People may not accept your request without an introduction. Send them a message first, saying something like “I really relate to what you said on the wikiHow page, can we be Facebook friends?”
If you feel comfortable, ask a few of your real-life friends to add your fake profile.

, Now that you’ve created a realistic Facebook profile and added friends, you’re ready to start using Facebook as your new persona! When you click Like on posts from celebrities or news sources, your friends will see the activity in their feeds and know that you’re a real person. They’ll also see when you post on those pages, so be sure to jump into some interesting conversations on your favorite show or new source’s page.

The trick is to make sure it's something you can afford to give away, or ideally make it a complementary item like a drink or kid's meal.

, Facebook fans get bored rather quickly. Using short expiration dates will get them to act right now instead of waiting and then forgetting about your offer. You should also change offers fairly often, at least 1-2 times per month, to keep your fans engaged with your company and paying attention to your posts.

Over-the-top expressions can make you look silly and obscure what you really look like., You want people to be able to match your profile picture with how you normally look. A profile picture should focus on showing your features as they naturally are.If you do your makeup, wear bright lipstick and make sure your eyebrows are perfect so they will enhance your expression.
Take off sunglasses or anything else that might obscure your features.

, When someone else takes the picture, you are more free to pose exactly the way you would like. Another set of eyes can also make sure the photo is staged well, and can offer feedback., A profile picture should focus on your face, but it can include more of your body if done correctly. For a simple, confident pose, stand with one hand positioned on a hip. Angle your elbow slightly backwards.If you do include more of your body in the picture, make sure that your face is still the focus, and that your features can be easily seen.

, Good posture is important, but standing perfectly straight can make you seem stiff and unnatural in a picture. Try tilting your body slightly to the side, and leaning your head slightly forward. This will make your body look more relaxed and proportional., Professional photographers talk about the “Rule of Thirds.” Imagine drawing two vertical lines that would divide the picture into three equal parts. Keep most of yourself on one of those lines, rather than directly in the middle of the picture., A selfie of yourself standing before a mirror with your phone visible is now a cliche. Turn the phone around and take the picture for better results. Most recent smartphones can take a picture so that you can see what’s being taken in the screen.You can also try propping your phone or camera against something and using the timer feature to take your picture.
Even a selfie stick can help you take a more flattering picture.
If you must take a picture in front of a mirror, hold the phone/camera at shoulder height and tilt it upwards. If you zoom in enough, this will keep the phone/camera out of the picture.

, Your face against a white background can seem a little boring. Try taking your picture in front of natural scenery, your work environment, or even a colored background.Don’t make the background too busy, however, If your profile picture is of you at a concert, your face might be lost in the crowd.

, You want to find a balance between a picture that is too dark and one that is too bright. It’s hard to take a good picture at night, and daylight between 11 pm and 1 pm is typically too harsh for good pictures. Try to take your profile picture in the morning or around sunset.Natural light is thought to be best for pictures. You can take a good profile picture with indoor light, however. Just position yourself so that the light source is not shining directly on you.
If you have to use flash, try to get someone to take the picture of you so that the flash won’t reflect too strongly off of your body.

, Facebook requires profile pictures to appear square. They will display at 170x170 pixels on computer pages, and 128x128 pixels on smart phones. Before uploading your picture, you can play around with your favorite photo editing software to make sure that the photo can be cropped to this size and still look good., Photos that are too rich in color can actually make your portrait seem unnatural. Use your editing software to turn down the color saturation before you upload., If the picture is too dark, you can use a photo editing software program to increase the brightness. However, be careful not to overuse the brightness setting. If you push things too far, you will look washed out and unnatural.If your picture really is too dark, take another one in better lighting.

Position the photo.",How to Make a Cover Photo on Facebook," You can use any image file to create your cover photo. What you pick really depends on what you want to represent you. This could be a landscape, vacation photo, piece of art, or any other picture you can imagine.


Many people avoid using a picture of themselves in the cover photo since their picture is already displayed in the Profile picture. Instead, try to convey a mood or outlook with your cover photo.
If you find an image online that you want to use, right-click on it and save it to your computer. Give it a name that will be easy to remember, as you will need to find it later.;
, Right-click on the image on your computer. Select Properties and then click the Details tab. Look for the Dimensions entry.


Facebook cover photos are 851px x 315px. If your image is smaller than that, it will be stretched to fit that size. This could result in distortion. If it is larger than that, you will be asked to select which area of the image that you want to display when you upload it. This means that parts of the image will not be seen.If you want to resize a larger image so that the entire image fits in the cover photo, see this guide.

, Before you upload your image, make any edits and changes in your preferred image editing software. You can add quotes, touch-up imperfections, and more. See this guide for some image editing tips.

, Once your image looks the way you want, you will need to upload it to your Facebook profile. Go to the Facebook home page, log in with your email and password, and then click your name in the upper-left corner of the Facebook page.

, You will see a button appear that says ""Change Cover"". Clicking the button will allow you to choose a picture from your Facebook photos or upload a photo from your computer. Click ""Upload Photo"" to choose the image from your computer.


Depending on the size of the image and the speed of your connection, the upload process may take a few minutes.

, If the image is larger than 851px by 315px, you can click and drag the image to set what part of it is displayed. You can always adjust it later by using the ""Change Cover"" button.

Don't aim to stand out in a crowd.,
Rent, don't buy.,
Drive a simple car.,
Don't seek out fancy, expensive possessions.,
Keep fit.,
Eat modestly.,
Be faithful.,
Spend time with your coworkers and friends.,
Don't be flashy.,
Be prepared to listen to people when they complain.",How to Live Like Mark Zuckerberg," Mark keeps under the radar as much as possible and doesn't court the media, the fans, or the celebrities. He is his own person and so should you be too. You don't have anything to prove - you're already the epitome of cool by trusting in your own value and style.;
, Mark rents a modest home in a quiet street in Palo Alto. He doesn't need the million dollar mansion to prove anything. Neither do you. Stick with your leafy suburban home and let the landlord pay for the maintenance and rates. Also, keep the property to a good size - no more bedrooms or bathrooms than needed by those residing in your home plus a guestroom.

, Mark has a $22,000 Japanese car. Clearly it's working for him. If you're lusting after a Porsche, Maserati, Ferrari or Hummer, give up the yearning now. Find a car that is reliable, affordable, sensible, and that fits you without a squeeze. You don't need a fancy car to prove you're a special person.

, Do these improve your life and happiness any? Not really. Cull it down to the bare necessities and the things that you really love (besides your family and friends that is!). Keep your mind focused on loving what you're doing, not loving what you're having. If you need that new iPhone because it will help you work and socialize, by all means, go for it. But forget upgrading and throwing things away just because you want the latest fad.

, Mark trains with a personal trainer five mornings a week. It's his only indulgence and it's a sensible one too. Keeping fit will allow your synapses to fire at full charge all the time, letting your creativity and ideas flow freely. Keeping fit also ensures you have adequate energy to keep up with everyone else from your kids to your employees or coworkers. Plus you'll live longer if you're in great shape.

, Mark doesn't go to fancy restaurants. He enjoys visiting his local Cafe Del Sol, a Mexican cafe near Facebook's HQ. Enjoy your food, and enjoy going to places that are comfortable and that fit in with the way you are rather than aiming to ""be seen"" or to overcharge the credit card.

, Mark has been dating Priscilla Chan since 2007. Make your girlfriend or wife your priority in life after, or at, the same level as work. Demonstrating your loyalty and faith in her will see the same returned tenfold to you.

, You're as good as them and they're as important as you. Mark enjoys having drinks with his staff and coworkers on a Friday after work. Even if you are Mr. Posh and all cashed up, remember the people who helped you to get where you are, always.

, Mark doesn't flash his cash around and he doesn't throw wild parties. Those are the sorts of activities a wannabe smart, cool guy would do. If you're smart and cool, you won't be needing to do these things.

, Mark's good at being a listener and being responsive. He isn't ashamed to admit to problems and to look for solutions. Be a real man and step up to the challenges in life.

Continue to have small interactions with her in person.,

Chat with her on Facebook.,
Bring your relationship back to the real world.,
Use body language to gauge your interactions.",How to Get to Know a Girl on Facebook," This doesn't need to be a long conversation or a date or anything, but make sure she knows who you are. Make eye contact and smile, ask her about the homework, get a friend to introduce you. Even just a small interaction will work to break the ice between you, so that when you do approach her on Facebook, it won't seem so random and she'll be much more likely to respond positively.;
, Once you've made contact with her in person, you can approach her online. Send a friend request and wait for her to respond. If she accepts, you can move on with these steps. If she rejects or ignores your friend request, however, take this as a sign that she's not comfortable getting to know you online. Respect her wishes and approach her in person, or leave her alone altogether.


Be patient. For someone who doesn't use Facebook often or during certain periods of time like exam weeks, it can take a while for her to accept your friend request.

, Hang out near her at school, eat lunch at the next table or sit a row away in class. You might get glances and stares from the girl when you pass by, so glance back and smile a bit, then keep walking. Start small conversations with her - ask about the homework or what she's having for lunch. Again, these don't need to be long, deep, meaningful conversations - you're just trying to create a base familiarity with her so that it won't be weird when you approach her online. This will help her feel more comfortable talking to you, so it will be easier to get to know her on Facebook.

, As her friend, you'll get to see her posts. Look through them. Like a few posts, but not too many - it gets very suspicious very quickly when you like everything she's ever posted, or any posts older than a week or two. Like her profile picture and cover photo if you want, and any other recent posts, but don't go overboard.

, Compliment any good pictures of her, post responses to articles or links she posts, or join in a friendly debate that she's having with someone else. If you think she'll like them, you can also reply to her posts with appropriate memes or gifs to spice up your comments. Always remember to be polite and respectful when commenting, and don't butt into every conversation she has - if she's talking about when to get together with another friend, don't jump in with your own availability.


Use memes, emoji, and emoticons to supplement your comments, not to replace them. These tools are useful when used sparingly, but they quickly get annoying when abused.

, When you see that she's online, message her to begin a conversation. Talk about school, her friends, what she's up to - anything. But make sure you have a conversation starter coming into the conversation - it's really hard to respond to a vague question like ""what's up?"" with anything that will actually spark a conversation. Instead, ask a direct, specific question like ""What did you think about the book we read in class this week?"", and have several follow-up questions planned to keep the conversation going.


Chat with her regularly. You don't need to chat for a long time or about anything too serious, especially not at first - chatting a little at a time will help make her more comfortable with the idea of talking to you. Develop your relationship over time until you're chatting for longer and longer periods of time, about more and more serious and interesting things.

, As much as you can get to know her online, it won't mean much unless you can bring it back to the real world. Approach her at school or invite her to hang out after school, and try to have the same kinds of conversations you're used to having online.


It's up to you to carry the talk, and keep bringing up topics day by day, make excuses to talk to her.

, Maintain eye contact as much as you can while talking to her. Don't look under-confident or over-confident, be just confident enough. Talk slowly, don't rush, practice at home if you must, make yourself clear.


Pay attention to her body language. If she looks at you a lot, if she turns her body towards you, or if you catch her checking you out, chances are, she's interested. If she backs away or turns away from you mid-conversation or as you approach her, she might be trying to avoid you.

As admin, Facebook will give you the option to do this directly from the page.


Make sure to include a comment where you ask people politely if they wouldn't mind supporting your new business and liking the page - people will respond more positively if you're nice.
You could also encourage them to invite their own friends to like the page - even if only a couple of people actually do, it will increase the page's exposure exponentially.;
, One of the most important ways you can encourage new fans and maintain your existing ones is to post interesting, informative and interactive content on a consistent basis. Try to post things that people will want to share with their friends, such as photos, videos, contests and relevant articles.


Remember - if even one existing fan with a couple of hundred friends shares your post on their own wall, the exposure to your page increases hugely.
Try to ask lots of questions and get people commenting on your posts, then make sure you answer each fan personally - this will encourage people to keep commenting and will inspire trust and loyalty in your brand.
You can also allow Facebook users to upload photos to your Fan Page.  People like things they can engage with.

, Offer an incentive for people to like your page, such as a special offer, coupon, or something creative. Make this offer exclusive to fans of your page, so people will have to like it in order to reap the rewards. This can be very effective and if the incentive is good, people will share it with their friends and families.


For example, if you run an online clothing store, you could do a promotion whereby fans of your page receive a special discount code which entitles them to 10% off their next purchase.
Or if your run a pet grooming salon, you could post a printable flyer which your fans can use to get one free dog wash. People love to get something for free, and once you've done it once, people will continue to check back with your page to look for more offers.

, Facebook groups can have a large influence and can share your page with many Facebook users. Groups have the power to send out e-mail alerts to followers, whereas fan pages can only send a notification through Facebook.


Try to entice the Group's admin(s) to share your page by providing good and relevant content and offer to promote their group on your page in exchange. A Facebook group won't want to send out spam to its followers, so make sure your page is related and that the relationship will be mutually beneficial.
For example, if you run an ice cream parlor which receives a lot of business from a nearby restaurant, you could ask that restaurant to promote your parlor as a good dessert option or even serve your ice cream alongside their own desserts. In return you could hand out flyers promoting the restaurant to your customers and display sample menus in the parlor.
Incentives like promotional codes and coupons will also help to encourage the followers of a group to like your Facebook page.

, This step is a little sneaky when focusing on competitors, but in the cut-throat world of business promotion, is completely fair game. Say that you notice the page of a big brand or business is constantly getting comments from their fans asking for help or advice about their products, but no one ever responds to these queries. If you run a similar type of business, you can swoop in and answer any questions and then post a link to your own page, encouraging their fans to come to you instead.You can also offer a better discount on one of your products if they join your page. For example, if you run a hair salon and you notice that fans of another local salon are always posting comments on that page looking for advice on how to achieve a certain hair style or recommendations on the best hair care products to use, but no one ever replies to them, you can take matters into your own hands and reply to those customers' comments and even advise them to like your page, as you regularly provide such helpful information.You can offer them a discount to like your page.Consumers love discounts.
Be aware that this is a bold move and might create tension between you and the owner of the other business when they realize what you've been doing. However, it might teach them the harsh reality that you cannot ignore your customers - especially in the fickle world of Facebook.As an alternative, you can search for review pages of products & services, finding your potential customers that way.

, It's really simple to add a Facebook ""Like Box"" to your business's home page, which makes it easy for your website visitors to like your Facebook page without having to leave the website or go to the effort of searching for you on Facebook themselves. This is a good move as chances are that if a person is on your website, they are already familiar with your service or product and will be more inclined to like you on Facebook.


You could also inform visitors to your site that by liking you on Facebook, they will be entitled to exclusive promotions, offers and content that they wouldn't receive anywhere else, even on the company's website - so if they like your brand they will need to like you on Facebook just to receive these offers.
Also consider including a ""Like us on Facebook"" link in your employee's email signature. Most businesses send out hundreds of emails a day so this is a very easy way to garner more likes!, This is a contest that only people who like your page can enter. The prize can be anything from an in-depth feature to one of your products. The bigger the prize, the more likely people will be to like your page and enter the contest. They might also be inclined to share the the contest with friends, encouraging even more people to like your page.


You can make the contest interactive by using fun and interesting ways for people to submit their entries. For example, you could ask people to upload pictures of themselves with one of your products. So if you run a cupcake store, you could ask fans to post a picture of themselves eating one of your cupcakes.
You could also ask people to post their stories on your Facebook page, where the best story wins. For example, if you own a flower shop and are offering a prize of a free bouquet of roses for Mother's Day, you could ask people to send in their favorite childhood memory of their mother, or the reason that their mother deserves to win.

, If you have any positions opening up in your company or business, think about posting that information on your Facebook page, along with a short job description and details on how to apply. This will encourage people to share the post with other job seekers and keep them coming back to your page for more updates. , Sometimes just letting real-life people know that your business is on Facebook is enough to drive the number of page likes upward. If your business is hosting or taking part in an event, why not take a photographer along to take pictures of those in attendance. Then let them know that can easily view the pictures just by liking your business's Facebook page! You can also hand out flyers and business cards with the call to ""Like us on Facebook!"" printed clearly., For a fee, Facebook will promote your page to its users, giving you access to people you never would have reached otherwise. Make sure to use Facebook Insights to track your demographics so your ads are well-targeted at the correct audience, this will ensure that you get the most bang for your buck. You should also try to make the image and the wording of your advertisement relevant to current trends in your industry.Be aware that Facebook ads can be costly, so make sure to set a budget you can afford.
You can also buy Google ads that will direct traffic to your Facebook page.

, Buying Facebook likes is a proven method of increasing the number of people who check out your page. This also increases your page's search engine ranking. Buying likes right at the beginning, just after you've set up your page, is good because it attracts real likes from people. It's the herd mentality - people will like what they see other people liking!


Be aware that buying likes is a good method of getting your page up and running, but you won't be truly successful until real people start liking it. You will still need to engage with your customers in the comments and tell people about your business to have a really successful page.

, There are many ways you can promote your Facebook page in real life. More often people notice about your Facebook page in real life, the chances of them visiting and liking your Facebook page increases.

Post often, but not too often.,
Post more photos and videos.,
Keep it short and sweet.,
Ask interactive questions.,
Like other people's posts.,
Be funny.,
Avoid posts that appear attention or sympathy seeking.,
Post at strategic times of day.,
Cheat.",How to Get More Facebook Likes2," Posting often increases your visibility on people's timelines, making it less possible for your posts to be overlooked or skimmed over. If you can become known for posting interesting and funny status updates, photos and videos, people will be more likely to stop and take notice when your name appears on their feed. The more people who actually pay attention to what you're posting, the more people who'll be inclined to like each post.


A word of warning though, posting too often will just clog up people's feeds and they'll become tired of it, which may lead them to hide you from their timeline or possibly unfriend you - not what you want at all!
A good guideline to follow is about 1 to 2 posts a day, everyday. According to an analysis done by KissMetrics, posting 1 -2 times a day increases other Facebook users' engagement by 40%., People are very visually-oriented, so photos and videos are more likely to capture people's attention than wordy status updates. It only takes about half a second for a person to take in a picture, so it requires very little effort, and they can respond to it almost immediately. Interesting or funny videos are also a great way to get likes, but you may need to include a comment which entices people to watch the video in the first place, something enigmatic and intriguing like ""This video is so funny I snorted milk through my nose"" or ""I can't believe this video is for real...needs to be seen to be believed!""


Tagging friends and acquaintances in pictures is also a great way to get likes and possibly make new friends. People are narcissistic and like to see pictures of themselves (as long as they're flattering!) so get tagging and start rolling in the likes.
With camera phones and apps like Vine and Instagram it's now so easy to upload your own high-quality videos featuring you and your friends. Again, people are more interested in things involving themselves, so a tagged video of your friends reenacting Katy Perry's new music video will probably get more likes than if you posted the official Katy Perry video itself.

, People are lazy. And impatient. They want to be entertained and they want it now. Therefore, long-winded or wordy status updates are more likely to be given a cursory glance, then quickly scrolled past. Remember that Facebook is not a blog - people don't want a summary of your day, a description of what you ate for breakfast or a lengthy opinion piece on the latest episode of Breaking Bad. They want short, amusing anecdotes or concise updates on cool, interesting things you've seen or done. So give the people what they want.


Unlike Twitter, you're not technically limited to 160 characters or less, but you should seriously consider imposing this rule on yourself!
Of course, if you have a blog, you're more than welcome to share a link to these in-depth musings on your Facebook page. Once you've built up a reputation for posting interesting and unique status updates, people might be more inclined to click through to your blog.

, Another great way to get more likes is to be interactive with your Facebook friends, by asking engaging questions and requesting other people's opinions. You can also ask for other people's help or recommendations - people like to be the ones to give the best or most interesting answer. Examples of this might include something like:


""Calling all techies! My computer is refusing to install the new version of iTunes...help please?"" or ""Anyone tried that new pizza place downtown? I need a cheese-y carb fix - stat!"" Just be sure to reply to any respondents quickly so they'll be willing to help you out again in future.
Do not abuse the question system though, you shouldn't ask questions that are too personal or that require too much effort from other users. For example, asking people whether a certain picture ""makes you look fat"" is a definite no-no, while asking people for an explanation of how to make a PowerPoint presentation is just lazy. Google it.

, Sometimes you just need to establish a mutual ""liking"" relationship with another person, especially if you're not particularly close to them in real life. Even if someone enjoys or appreciates something you posted, they may hold back from liking it because they're afraid of seeming weird when you don't know each other well. In this scenario, you should be the one to break the ice by liking one of their posts first. This way they'll feel more comfortable, or maybe even obliged, to like yours back. It's a win-win situation!


If you really don't know the other person all that well, you should be somewhat scrupulous in the posts you choose to like. For example, you should avoid liking a post that says something like ""Just broke up with my boyfriend of 6 months - happy to be single again!"" If you're barely acquaintances with this person, or if you happen to be friends with their boyfriend, it will seem weird if you like it.
You should also avoid liking posts where the person is obviously upset or frustrated about something. For example, you shouldn't randomly like a post that says ""My childhood dog just died at 15 years of age. RIP Fido, you will be greatly missed. :("" That would just be mean.

, Okay, so this can be hard advice to put into practice, especially if humor isn't your strong suit. But as mentioned before, people go on Facebook to be entertained, so if you can post something that makes someone laugh, or even smile, you will be handsomely rewarded with likes.


Try to think of something funny or weird that happened to you and write about that. Or if you're brave, describe an embarrassing situation you found yourself in, such as calling your Spanish professor ""Mom"" or knocking over a cart full of pineapples at the supermarket.
If you can't be funny, use someone else's humor instead. Search for an entertaining joke on the internet and post it to your wall, or share a particularly clever version of a popular meme. You may not have come up with it yourself, but you'll still get all the credit.

, In general, people don't like Facebook posts which are solely intended to attract attention or garner sympathy. If you post those kinds of status updates, you're more likely to get a a disgruntled ""tut!"" and a roll of the eyes than a large collection of likes. Posts that fall into this category include those that are self-congratulatory (""OMG, can't believe I got signed with a modeling agency/ got the top exam score in my class/ got asked on a date by the hot guy/girl at Starbucks!), overly self-deprecating (""Just ate an entire packet of cookies - No wonder I'm so fat"") or ANY pictures of you staring moodily/pouting/winking at the camera that you clearly took of yourself.


You should also nix on the enigmatic or overly-vague posts which are clearly designed to elicit a sympathetic ""what's wrong?"" or ""what happened?"" Posts like ""worst day of my life"" or ""some people have no shame"" are two such examples.
Posts like ""I hate my hair! I wish it would just do as it's told for once!"" are on the borderline. If you're known for your crazy, flyaway curls then it's probably acceptable. If, however, you usually look like you just stepped out of a Pantene commercial and could easily be mistaken for Serena van der Woodsen's long-lost sister, you will receive no mercy from the Facebook Gods and probably no likes.
If you must post these kinds of statuses, at least try to keep them tongue-in-cheek by acknowledging that you're looking for attention. Use a clever hashtag (yes, you can do that on Facebook now) or simple ""haha!"" to show that you are not entirely serious.

, Pay attention to your own Facebook habits and keep an eye on chat to see who's online and when. Then use this information to figure out the best times of day to post a status, so you can maximize the number of potential likes. Generally speaking, people are more likely to check their Facebook first thing in the morning and later on in the evening, after school or at work. Therefore you should time your posts to coincide with such periods of high activity.


If you post things at unsociable hours, such as late at night or on a weekday afternoon, you may be disappointed by the number of likes your post receives. In this case, a lack of likes may have nothing to do with the quality of the post, but rather its poor timing.
You will also need to consider external factors which may influence people's Facebook use. For instance, if it's a beautiful day, people will be less inclined to be inside on their computers, or if there's a big music festival or sports event on over the weekend, people may not check their Facebook til Monday. Try to save your best statuses for times when you know they'll be seen.

, So there are a few sneaky tricks you can try if you're really desperate for likes. One of the most popular is to post a status that says ""Like for a number"". Then you will proceed to send anyone who likes the status a random number via private message. Once that's done, you will start commenting beneath your previous status, stating each number and giving a short description of the person that number was assigned to.


For example, if your friend Jessica liked your status and you sent Jessica the number 17 in a private message, you might comment ""17 - One of the craziest people I've ever met - so fun to be around!"" This way, Jessica will know you're talking about her, but nobody else will!
Do the same for every person who liked your status...once enough people catch on to what you're doing, they'll want a piece of the action! A word of advice though - keep your ""opinions"" upbeat and complimentary, nobody wants to be insulted on Facebook, even if it's anonymous!
Another, similar option is to post a status that says ""Like for an H.O"" (or just ho). H.O. stands for ""honest opinion"", so once a person likes your status you will send them a private message with your ""honest"" opinion of them (note the air quotes). Be nice - you're trying to win friends, not alienate them.

Get a lot of Facebook friends.,
Develop real-life relationships.,
Be active on Facebook.,
Post the right photos.,
Post the right status updates.",How to Get a Lot of Facebook Likes,"


The easiest way to improve your chances of getting a lot of likes is to have a lot of Facebook friends. If you only have ten Facebook friends, then you won't be able to get very many likes, no matter how amazing your posts are. Here's how to get as many Facebook friends as you can:
Don't be shy about friending acquaintances. If you briefly met someone and you run in the same circles, it is socially acceptable to friend that person. As long as you don't go over the top and send the acquaintance a message or post on his or her wall immediately, just sending a friend request will be a great way to make a new Facebook friend.
Don't be afraid to friend someone from your past. If Facebook keeps recommending friends to you, it will be because you have friends or a network in common. As long as the person knows who you are, it's okay to request to be his or her friend.
Be socially active. If you're friendly in the workplace, in your yoga class, and during your Saturday afternoon volunteering sessions, you'll be more likely to meet more people who can be your friends on Facebook.
Don't be discouraged if many of your Facebook friends never like your posts. Many people feel that they have to be closer friends with someone to like his or her photos, but there are many exceptions to this rule, and you will definitely get likes from people you haven't heard from in years if you post the right things.;
,


Having a lot of Facebook friends will certainly improve your chances of getting likes, but cultivating real-life relationships will also help you get people to like you're photos. Here's how this works:
If people feel closer to you, they will be more likely to browse your profile. If they find something they like, then they will let you know!
People will also feel more comfortable liking your photos if they hang out with you face-to-face.
You can also tell your real-life friends about things you have posted. You don't have to be obvious about it or plug yourself too much, but you can casually say things like, ""Hey, did you check out that link I posted on Facebook?"" or ""I just posted an album from last weekend's party. You should check it out--there's an amazing photo of you there!""
You can also tag your friends in your photo albums. This will make them much more likely to browse your photos, and to like your various posts.

,


You have to be a Facebook community member of good standing to get a lot of likes. You can't expect to post an album, photo, or comments and get an instant reaction if you don't reciprocate. Here's how:
Update your status with something fun or meaningful at least once a day. That way, people will be thinking of you.
Go on Facebook at least once a day. Make a goal to like at least five things that come up on your newsfeed.
Try to like the posts of someone different every time, so you are on his or her radar. If you like the posts of a person you don't know so well, he or she will know it's okay to like your posts. Just make sure to not like the photos of someone completely random who barely remembers who you are.
Make a goal to post on the walls of a few of your Facebook friends each day. Send at least one person a message each day.
Don't underestimate the power of an occasional poke.
Be active on Facebook, but don't be annoying. You don't want your Facebook friends rolling their eyes at how often you pop up on their newsfeed. If you're too active, some of your friends may block your status updates or unfriend you.

,


Once you've amassed enough Facebook friends and have many real-life connections, you can work on honing the photos that you post. The type of photo you post can determine how many people will like it. Here are some Facebook photo posting dos and don'ts:
If you post a photo of yourself, make sure it's silly, fun, or extraordinary in some way. If you're in a new location, wearing a fun costume, or dressed up for a special occasion, it's worth posting. If it's just an ordinary photo of you, then it may not be like-worthy.
Posting a photo with a celebrity is guaranteed to get you lots of likes.
Posting a photo from your childhood, if it's really cute or goofy, will also get lots of likes.
If you graduated from school or ran a marathon, post a photo of you with your diploma or your finisher's medal.
Generally, posting photos of more than one person will make it easier for you to get more likes. If multiple people are tagged in the photo, then they will be more likely to look at it.
If you post a cute photo of you and your significant other, people tend to like those. Just try not to look too smug in the photo, because your Facebook friends may get annoyed by that.
Post your photos at the right time of day, when you know people are at their computers. If you post it too early in the morning or too late at night, it may get overlooked.
Avoid posting too many photos of scenery or monuments. You may be really proud of your vacation to Rome, but if you're not in the photo, then you will just be the 100th person to post a picture of the Trevi fountain that day.

,


Your status update is not only your way of letting people know what's going on in your life, but your way of trying to show your Facebook friends how witty, thoughtful, or just plain fun you are. Here are some ways to get a lot of likes on your status update:
Be short and sweet. Pretend that you're posting on Twitter. Try to entertain your audience in 100 characters or less. If your status is so long that your friends have to click to read the rest, they will get bored.
Don't be afraid to be completely silly. You don't have to show off all the time.
The right quote from a popular TV show right after it airs is sure to get lots of likes from the people who know what you're talking about.
If you're going on vacation or have recently arrived in a new city, post about it and people will be excited for you.
Don't post too many updates that complain about the weather, talk about how boring work is, or are way too personal for the Facebook community. Your Facebook friends are used to seeing this every day, and will be more impressed if you're original.
Check the news frequently. If you're the first person to spot a breaking news story and you post it, you will get lots of props.

Use a quality camera or mobile smartphone for taking photos.,
Decide what to take a snap of.,
Choose a good background.,
Click the same picture more than once.,
Edit your photo if needed.,
Upload your picture in the Facebook app if you're on a mobile device.,
Upload your picture to the computer and then to Facebook if you're using a camera.,
'Like' your friends' pictures.,
Stay active on Facebook.,
Use hashtags and fun captions.,
Don't hack Facebook likes.",How to Get Likes on Your Facebook Photos," Using a smartphone makes it very easy to take, edit, and upload a photo without any extra work.


Mobiles are particularly useful for selfies. Although you may be able to use a camera for selfies, it won't produce the best result because many phones have two cameras: one in the back, and one in the front.
If you're really interested in high quality results, instead of using the camera in the front to take selfies, use the one in the back. The back camera takes higher-resolution pictures. Thus, you may get more likes on the picture.;
, Selfies are obviously a popular choice, but they're not necessarily the most interesting to other Facebook users. You know your social media friends best; think about what they like. If a funny picture will go over well, find something amusing in your day to snap. If you're friends with a lot of outdoor lovers, take a photo of a beautiful scene in nature or of your latest hiking accomplishment. If you've recently been married or had a baby, take a picture that your loved ones will associate with your milestones.

,


When it comes to photos outdoors, make sure that the camera/mobile is facing opposite the sun. This way, the picture will be more clear.
If you're taking a photo indoors, make sure that the room has good lighting. For a better effect, there should be presence of natural sunlight in the room.
For more details about clicking better photos, learn how to Take Better Photographs

If you're taking a selfie, strike good poses. For more details, learn how to Take Good Selfies.

, Take a mobile/camera and click the same picture twice or thrice. This way, you can look at the 2-3 pictures of the same type, and upload the one that looks better. It is way better than to waste extra time in taking the same pose again while taking a better selfie, or adjusting the camera/mobile to click a better photo.

, If your photo is dark or unclear, adjust the brightness and color, and crop it so that the most interesting part of the image is central and well-framed.

, You don't have to transfer the mobile pictures to the computer to upload them on Facebook. The Facebook app is available in most mobiles. If the Facebook app is not available, then you can download it. Once you're done with downloading, launch the app and sign in. Read the points below and follow accordingly to upload mobile pictures.


Towards the top of the page, click on the 'Photo' option that you can see. Make sure that you're signed in.
Then, select 'Choose from gallery' for the picture you've taken.
Select the picture you'd like to upload.
Add description of the picture (optional).
Then select 'Upload' option.
Your photo will be posted on your Facebook page. If you've given description about the photo, it will appear right beneath the photo!

, You'll have to first transfer the picture in the computer for that. If you don't know how to transfer camera pictures to the computer, you can refer to How to Transfer Images from a Digital Camera to a Computer. When you're done with transferring camera pictures to computer, read the points below to upload them to Facebook through your regular browser:


Sign in into your Facebook account.
At the top of the""What's on your mind"" bar of your Facebook page, click 'Photo/Video' to upload pictures to your Timeline Photos album.
Select the pictures you want to add to Facebook.
Add description to the picture (optional).
Click Post.

, Like your friends' pictures so that your name will pop up with the 'like'. Plus, if you like their pictures, they'll feel more inclined to like yours too. Just like you, your friends need likes too!

, When others like your posts, respond to them. Engaging with your friends will leads to more likes.


Add more friends that will lead to more engagement with more people, thus giving you even more likes! Also, the simple logic that's true: More friends leads to more likes!

, Writing an engaging or amusing caption to go with your photo often attracts more attention and gets people reacting to the image more than they otherwise would.

, Unless it is extremely important to fool a majority of people, there is no reason whatsoever to do this. Anything that doesn't guarantee a true fan of your picture isn't worth it and won't last for long.

Use data to open the Facebook app on your phone.,
Use your smartphone as a hotspot.",How to Get on Facebook When It's Blocked1," You can do this by opening Google's URL shortening site, typing https://www.facebook.com/ into the Your original URL here box at the top of the page, and clicking Shorten URL.

For an Android, open Settings, tap Wireless & Networks (on some phones, this may just be a heading rather than a folder) and then slide the Wi-Fi switch left.
You can also open the mobile version of Facebook in your phone's browser while using data if you don't have the Facebook app.

, Many iPhones and Android phones have a hotspot setting that allows your phone to act as a miniature router. Once your phone's hotspot is enabled, you can connect to it by selecting your phone's name from the available networks section of your computer and entering the hotspot password listed on your phone.For an iPhone, open Settings, tap Personal Hotspot near the top of the page, and slide the Personal Hotspot switch right. The hotspot password is listed on this page as well.
For an Android, open the Wireless & Networks section of the Settings menu, tap the Portable Hotspot option, make sure Portable Wi-Fi Hotspot is checked, and tap the Hotspot Settings option. You can name your network and set its password from here.

, It would probably be best to talk face-to-face since you can more easily see the person's facial expressions and body language.

, If he or she is around his or her other friends, for example, excuse yourself and tell your ""friend"" that you need to talk. For example, you could say ""Cindy, there is something we need to talk about, and I want it to be between the two of us privately. Could you come with me (to a private spot), please?"";
, Be respectful and mature.

, Here are examples of lines that you could use:


If you unfriended the person because you don't know him or her that well (or have too many people on your Facebook friends list, try this line: ""Cindy, I'm sorry to say, but I felt it was time to take you off my Facebook friends list. You're a very nice person and I like you a lot and enjoy talking to you, but I have over 500 friends on Facebook, and I am making an effort to be more discerning and limit my friends list to people who I know very well and trust a lot. I hope you understand"".

Make great posts.,
Make a commitment to earn.",How to Make Money Using Facebook1," The foundation of any successful plan to make money with social media is good content, and lots of it. On Facebook, that means a stream of interesting links, images, and updates every day.


Search for a niche and fill it with quality content. It doesn't have to be a niche nobody else is filling, but it should be specific enough that it's clear to the casual observer. For example, maybe you'll post content for cat lovers, mothers, or people with a certain political affiliation. If you plan to market a product with your account, be sure to link the product to your posts in some way.
Consider opening up another Facebook account and keeping it separate from your personal account. Use this account for your posts, and link them on your personal Facebook account to let people know about them. Depending on the approaches you use, you might even consider using multiple extra accounts. NOTE: Facebook will not allow multiple accounts using the same email and/or phone number. You may even get a request to verify a new Facebook account through a code texted to your phone.
Give it time. Let your account build up interest over time by continuing to provide fresh and relevant content every day.;
, The only way to reliably make money using Facebook is through persistent work. Like any job, setting a schedule and sticking to it is the key.


Organize. Whatever strategy you plan to pursue, you'll probably have to take care of several things every day to make it work for you. Plan out the order and times you'll do them in advance.
Saturate your market. Making money with Facebook is more of a numbers game than anything else. Since marketing on Facebook costs nothing except time, you can market as much as you want – even to a point that would be prohibitively expensive any other way – and let the percentages and statistics work their magic one penny at a time.
Add aggressively. One of the best ways to increase the number of people looking at your page is to simply add people as friends as often as you can. Most won't accept, but some will.

Find an affiliate program or other link-type advertising program.,
Sign up.,
Add accounts.,
Promote your programs.",How to Make Money Using Facebook2," Affiliate programs provide you with a unique ID and marketing materials, and then pays you a commission based on how much business you generate. So try to find a Good Affiliate marketing website and start earning.


Most websites you've heard of offer such a program. Since there's no cost to the site for letting you do this, practically anybody can become an affiliate for as many sites as they want.
Start with well-known brands. Amazon offers a competitive affiliate program that pays a percentage of any purchase a person makes after clicking through from your post, even if it's not anything you advertised. Apple's iTunes program has an affiliate program as well.
Add in smaller programs. Though less likely to generate money on a given day, you can diversify and gradually increase your affiliate revenue by offering a wide range of advertising services to many different businesses.

, Once you've decided to market a company as an affiliate, search the company's site and fill out the required forms. This should always be free, and usually only takes a few minutes.


Don't ever pay to become an affiliate.

, Make a Facebook account for each affiliate program or group of programs you sign up for. This allows people to follow your pages based on the things they're interested in, rather than having to sign up for one page full of all different kinds of ads.


As mentioned previously, you can use your primary account to repost things from the other accounts periodically, exposing those pages to the audience you've built.

, Make posts for each of them daily, and maintain your accounts fastidiously. With luck, and a good central account with a lot of followers, your affiliate accounts will begin to get followers as well. Whenever anyone clicks your posts and buys something from one of your affiliates, you earn money.

Write an e-book.,
Pick a publishing option.,
Get your e-book online.,
Sell your e-book on Facebook.",How to Make Money Using Facebook3," E-books are just book-format publications that are distributed electronically, rather than printed on paper. Because there's basically no cost to publish an e-book, pretty much anybody with an idea can do it.


Take it easy on yourself. Unlike a paper-and-ink book, your e-book doesn't have to be any particular number of pages. In fact, most e-books that are written to generate income are more like e-pamphlets than whole books.
Choose a subject that will generate interest. Nonfiction is almost always a better choice than fiction. Oddly enough, e-books that tell people how to make money selling e-books are a popular option, and they apparently sell enough to at least offset the trouble of writing them.
Write in an area where you can claim some kind of authority. It'll add cachet to your book. You don't need to show credentials, but you should write about something you're better at than the average Joe.

, There are a few free ways to get your e-book published.


The most basic option is to save the book as a PDF file, and lock it with a password that you send to people who buy your book. Once the password is out there, anyone with the password can open the book.

Createspace is an Amazon.com service that allows you to publish e-books for free on the Amazon website. It offers better usage protection than the PDF method, but can't be directly distributed from anywhere other than Amazon's website. Createspace also has a number of paid services and options available. To maximize your Facebook profit, avoid using them.
ReaderWorks is a program that easily formats and published e-books in Microsoft Reader format, one of the most common e-book formats on the web. The Basic version of the program doesn't offer any security, but it's free and easy to learn. There's a paid version of ReaderWorks that adds digital rights management (DRM) protection. Only opt in for the paid version if you're going to be making a lot of books with it.

, Createspace will post your book automatically. If you published it on your own computer, you can sell it a few different ways:


Amazon will let you upload and sell your e-book as a Kindle book for free. (Kindle is the brand name of Amazon's popular e-reader product line.) This option is called Kindle Direct Publishing, or KDP.

On the plus side, KDP is fast and very flexible. You can publish your book in about 5 minutes, and set sale royalties for yourself as high as 70% (with Amazon taking the other 30%).
On the other hand, KDP does not publish your book for download outside of the Kindle marketplace. Readers who don't use Kindle won't be able to browse and purchase your book.



eBay will let you list items for sale at a set price. By offering a stock of “copies” of your e-book available for purchase on eBay, you can turn the venerable auction site into a de facto bookselling hub.

The advantage of eBay is its simplicity. Anyone with access to the site can potentially purchase a copy of your book – no special gadgets or software required.
The downside is the cost. eBay sets fees for just about everything; they only get worse when you set a fixed price point for purchases. Some of the fees are percentages, but others are flat, which can really bite into your profit margin if you're not careful.



, If you were wise and wrote a book that caters to the audience you've been building up with your primary account, you've got a receptive, ready-made audience for your sales pitch.


Advertise it several times a day, both blatantly and at the end of other posts. Be creative and try to engage your readers. Get them excited about reading your book.
If you have other accounts (such as affiliate accounts), advertise your book there, too.
Always provide a link for reader to click to visit the page where they can purchase your book.

You can create free websites as well.

Remember that people join together because of a common interest.,
Take some time to read what people are discussing.,
Make a Facebook Page about your common interest.,
Post your comments knowing they can help others.

,
Make friends – that’s what social media is all about.,
Take some time to visit other people’s Facebook profile pages.

,
Leave a comment or two on subjects that spark your interest, not just a meaningless comment , hoping to syphon people from other profiles.,
Don’t restrict yourself to internet marketing alone.,
Don’t just dabble with Facebook!",How to Grow Your Online Business Using Facebook," If you share that same common interest, then join the group. Never join for the money. Do it because the subject genuinely interests you. Do it because you’ve got something to share with that group.;
, Then, add your comments when you’ve got something that can help.

, Every day, post a comment about something you learned or a new insight you had. The small things you learn can be valuable to other people if only that it confirms their own experience.

,,


If you find other people who resonate with you, then add them as a friend. Don’t keep adding people just to bulk up your numbers – your number of friends means nothing.
To positively influence 10 people is better than to have 100 friends and influence no one.
So, add friends when they share something in common with you. Eventually, your Facebook page will centre around that common theme because that’s the bond among all your friends. Then, others will regard you highly on that topic.

,, That adds no value. With Facebook you should always aim to contribute something.


Others will appreciate your contribution, and they’ll leave comments on your pages which are sincere and valuable. That’s the law of attraction.
If you junk up other people’s pages, you’ll find that happening to yours. If you add something of quality, you’ll find that coming back too – like attracts like.

, Chances are, you spend time with people who share your common interest. Have them check out your Facebook page. You can even help them get started on Facebook.


If you belong to any offline groups, a quick mention of your internet presence can get more people involved.
There’s often a gap between offline and online groups. You can add value by simply connecting the two. You gain credibility online when you bring fresh people with new ideas. Your offline credibility also benefits because you’re seen as internet-savvy.

,


If you’re going to be successful on the internet and grow your online business , you’ll need to do this regularly. Try it for 30 days, regardless of how you feel. Simply develop the habit of posting some helpful comments every day for a month, then evaluate your results.

Is this habit working for you?
How do the others in your Facebook group respond to you?
Do they know who you are?
Do they hold you and your comments in high esteem?
Are you welcomed because you contribute?
If you feel it’s working for you, then keep it- soon your habit will be aligned with the law of attraction and you won’t have to give it much thought because you do it automatically.

Optimize your post.",How to Advertise on Facebook1," While your event or business does not need to have a Facebook presence, you do need to be a registered Facebook user in order to advertise on Facebook.


You may want to create a new login ID, and not use your personal account. In particular, if you have someone who you need to submit receipts to, it is much better to set up a new Facebook account so that you don't have to share passwords.;
, A page is a profile for your business. You don't need a Page in order to advertise of Facebook, but most — if not all — big businesses have an established Page. On your Page, you can promote items or services, interact with established customers, and create opportunities to reach new customers..

, Often, this is the logo that people associate with your brand.

, This is the first thing that people will see when they view your business's Page. Your cover photo spans nearly the entire width of your Page and, again, should be something that customers might associate with your business.


For example, you're making a page for your business, Barbara's Catered Cupcakes. You might want to showcase a close-up of cupcakes, or perhaps a picture of Barbara working behind the scenes, baking her wares.

, Customers who come to your Page should be able to glean right away what services or products you offer based on this sentence.

, Choose an available web address in order to use on other promotional material.

, Posts can be anything ranging from a notice of a summer sale to the announcement of a new product line. Your posts can be in the form of updates, photos, or videos. People who like your product will sometimes see your post show up in their news feed.

, Advertisers have realized that not all posts are created equal. If you want more business driven by Facebook posts, and you want that business to grow in the right direction, be sure to keep the following tips in mind when posting:


Keep it short and sweet. According to Facebook, posts that are on the shorter side — between 100 and 250 characters — get about 60% more likes, comments and shares.That's a big difference.
Appeal to the visual sense. Not everyone processes information better through words. In fact, a lot of people learn by seeing, tapping their visual sense. Photo albums, pictures, and videos drive engagement on Facebook Pages.
Use Page Insights to help you learn. Page Insights is a function that allows you mine your analytics so that you can better reach out to customers.

Make sure you have all the information you need for creating your Facebook ad.,
Go to your Facebook home page and on the right-hand sidebar, look for the section marked “Sponsored,” where ads appear.,

Place your order.",How to Advertise on Facebook2," Depending on what you plan on advertising, this can include a website URL; event times, dates or places, such as the details of a special performance at a nightclub; or a photo or logo to include with the ad.

, Next to the word “Sponsored” is a link that reads, “Create an Ad.” Click on that button.

, Note that for each choice you make when creating your ad, Facebook automatically generates a preview at the bottom of the page so you can see instantly what your ad will look like before proceeding.


Destination: Choose between an external URL (website) or a Facebook page you have created.
For pictures you choose to use in your ads, be careful they are not owned by someone else. You want to either use your own pictures, or pictures in the public domain.

For an external URL, you’ll need to include the URL in the proper field. Then enter the title of your ad, the body of your ad copy and an image or logo.
For a Facebook page you can choose between Sponsored Stories, which includes either a story about the viewer's friends or a story about your Facebook Page posts, or Facebook Ads, which includes a specific message and call to action written by you.

For a Sponsored Story, you’ll need to choose between a Page Like Story and a Page Post Story. A Page Like Story will show the user a friend who likes your page, with the call to action being a “Like” button. A Page Post Story shows the user an excerpt and image from your last post on Facebook; here, the call to action includes a comment button, a “Like” button and a Share button.
For a Facebook Ad, you will need to choose the Destination Tab or which tab of your Facebook page the link in your ad will direct the user. Then you can include the body of your ad copy and an image or logo.





, Facebook ads offer the company or service provider a lot of versatility. What do you hope to accomplish with your ads?


Get More Page Likes. People who like your page will be likelier to see posts that you create on your Page. The more likes you have, the larger your audience becomes when you create a post.

Advertising for likes is controversial. Some people think its great, others think its of limited usefulness and will tell you it's a waste of money.
Look at where your likes are coming from. Some ad campaigns have ended up getting a business tons of likes from some 3rd world country where the business doesn't operate.


Promote Page Posts. Promote a specific post you've created, increasing its chances of reaching your intended audience.
Get New Users. Target people who are more likely to download and use your app.
Increase Attendance. Target people who are more likely to attend one of your functions.

, Don't just advertise blindly. Advertise intelligently. Who you target in your ads could affect your bottom line. If you're not targeting the right demographic(s), you're taking a stab in the dark.


Location: Choose a specific city, state/province or country where your ads will be seen.
Demographics: Choose an age range and whether you want to target men, women or both.
Likes & Interests: Enter a specific interest, and Facebook will match your ad with the home pages of users who have included that interest in their profiles.
Connections on Facebook: Choose whom you’d like to target; choices range from only your friends to people who are or are not fans of your page, to all of Facebook.
Advanced targeting options include level of education of the user, whether to target people on their birthdays, language and relationship status.

,


If you choose beer drinkers in Germany, you may find you are reaching most of the population.
If you choose fans of pesticides in the north of Portland, Oregon, you may find you are reaching only a few people. Reaching this targeted group (whatever your target may be) is the best strategy, but if too small, think of ways to expand the target group.

Perhaps the people you are trying to reach are not telling you they like pesticides, but you might be able to reach those same people by choosing, say, landscapers or apple farmers.



, You can choose to either pay per click (CPC) or pay per impression (CPM). If you don't know exactly how you're going to budget your CPM, you should be prepared to pay more money for CPM than CPC.


Campaigns, Pricing and Scheduling: Here, you can choose the currency you want to use when paying for your ads, your daily or entire campaign budget, and when you’d like your ad to appear.

, Make sure that all of your information is correct. On this page, you have the chance to go back and edit any part of the ad you’ve designed.

, You can pay by credit card or by PayPal. You've officially started an ad and boosted your chance of seeing a return on your investment.

First, make sure you have a budget cap.,
The most important way to maximize the effectiveness in Facebook ads is to target narrowly.,
Facebook shows ads based on how often they get clicked on.,
Pictures are the biggest leverage you have other than targeting.,
Edit ads with mobile and tablet in mind.,
Create more leads with Offers.,
Save money by customizing your target audience.,
Make sure you don't get penalized on ads that feature images.,
Consider using videos to generate likes.",How to Advertise on Facebook3," So if you want to spend no more than $20 a day on your Facebook ads, set your cap at $20 daily. Very important!

, Examples:


If you are selling beer in the state of Oregon, target your ads to show only to those people who live in Oregon, who also like beer (have beer as an interest in their profile.) Probably, you'd want to choose age over 21. You might even choose to show your ad to men only!
If you are promoting a band, you will find it very effective to promote to people who like your band, your band's genre of music, and similar bands to yours.

, (It's called CTR, or Click Through Rate.) If your ads are showing, but all of a sudden don't show any more, it is because your CTR was too low. Try swapping out the picture in your ad and trying it again.

, Its worth trying your ads with different pictures at any time.

, According to some sources, 60% of users accessing Facebook do so on their phones and tablets.In fact, Facebook's mobile ads earn more than 2.5 times than its desktop ads, and the market for mobile is growing: In the first quarter of 2013, mobile-ad sales rose close to 25% from the last quarter.What practical impact does this have? For one, it means no right-hand column, which is where ads are shown on desktop. In order to make the most out of your ads, edit them with this in mind.


Use Facebook's Power Editor in order to select ads that translate to mobile. You need to have Chrome downloaded in order to download and use Power Editor. In order to download Power Editor:

Open a Chrome browser
Navigate to the Ads Manager page on Facebook.
Go to the Power Editor tab on the left hand side
Install the Power Editor application
Once the app is launched, click ""download"" and follow the remaining instructions


In the Power Editor, pay attention to the ad placement. Some people suggest placing the ad on both desktop and mobile in the news feed in order to optimize click-through rate. You can try different combinations of placements and experiment with how it affects your bottom line.

, So you want to connect with more potential customers and grow your customer base? You can create relationships with new customers by listing an Offer, where you give away something free. Customers love free stuff, and enticing them to buy goods and services with free things is a great way to connect with new users and drive repeat business.


If you're trying to generate leads, set up a landing page with a space for name and email. When customers input their name and email, email them a redeemable code for or copy of your Offer. Customers get their free stuff, you get your lead.

, If you're able to build up a sizable corps of fans, target ads directly to them. Customers who are already a fan of your product or service can be cheaper to advertise to and have higher click-through rates. This translates to less money spent by you and better conversions.

, Facebook recently revised its image policy on ads, stipulating that text can't take up more than 20% of the total ad image. In other words, Facebook is trying to guide ad creators to make better use of images of ads. Make sure you follow suit when you create an ad.

, Facebook allows you to make ads that target non-fans in the hopes of generating more likes. These ads are perfect opportunities for videos. Well-done videos can communicate excitement, recognition, and — most importantly — trust, something you need in order to generate more fans.


When doing a video, keep it short and sweet, like picture ads, and know who your demographic is. At the end of the video, include a call to action. A good video can help build trust more than almost any other media or promotion; use them wisely!

, Provide special discounts available only to Facebook users to generate profitable interest in your company. Create a call to action that will require customers who want to redeem your “Facebook only” special to interact with your website or Facebook page. This strategy will increase the chances of cultivating repeat business as well as aid in viral marketing as customers spread the word about your discounts.

This helps build consumer confidence and encourages customers to trust you for valuable products or services whether they need them now or in the future.

, If you sponsor charity events, webinars, trade shows, open houses or any other special events, your prospects and customers should know about it! Post an event in advance and keep the details updated to get maximum exposure.

, Respond to messages and comments from customers asking for information in a timely manner. When days or weeks go by without a response, it sends the message that you’re not interested in connecting with your customers.

, Monitor the comments posted by users to address positive and negative feedback in a timely manner. Thank satisfied customers for their comments and ask if their feedback can be used as testimonials on your website or other marketing materials. Should negative feedback arise, consider responding directly to the customer to resolve the issue. Taking a transparent, proactive approach to addressing negative feedback can help to resolve specific problems, and help to show other prospects that your business is committed to providing excellent service.

, Facebook emails a weekly report summarizing statistics for your users and page activity. Make the most of this information to see where you can make improvements. For example, use the Insights data to view the demographics of the users who “like” your page. This can help you define your target audience and appeal to their interests more effectively"

For example, choose an avatar that depicts a photo of yourself wearing safari gear or standing in front of a recognizable landmark if the purpose of your social media profile is to promote your travel blog.

, Avatars with many different background colors or objects may appear too ""busy,"" and could be difficult for some users to see; especially if the avatar is sized smaller for social media platforms such as Twitter. For example, use a photograph that clearly displays your face against a solid-colored background.

Use the same avatar across all your social media platforms.",How to Use Avatars for Social Media2," Choosing an accurate, up-to-date photo as your avatar keeps your profile authentic and genuine; especially if you frequently connect with other users in person.

Recognize what kind of username your are creating.,
Don't make it too complicated.,
Recognize the site's specifications.,
Understand that you may have this username for a long time.,
Avoid using too much personal information.",How to Think of a Username1," In a lot of cases, your username only appears to you as the account holder. However, if you are creating an account on an online forum, a shared account, or are creating a username in a work environment, it is important to remember that the other users in your community will be able to see your username.;
, While a complicated username can be great for privacy reasons, it is important to remember that you will most likely need to recall this information on a regular basis.

, Some websites require your username to meet specific guidelines, like a capital letter and at least two instances of numbers or symbols. Make sure you meet these requirements when designing your username.

, It is incredibly important to make sure that your username will be appropriate in the future because you may be using it for a long time. For instance, a username that you find appropriate as a student or young adult may not be appropriate when you enter the workforce.

, In a lot of situations it is important to maintain anonymity, especially when posting to forums and comment sections on the internet. You probably don't want that comment you left on YouTube to lead to someone messaging you through Facebook!

Think of something unique to you.,
Keep it simple.,
Add numbers or symbols.",How to Think of a Username2," It often helps to think of a unique characteristic about yourself, like your eye color or a particular passion you may have. This does not mean the last four digits of your Social Security Number! Be vague! A good example may be ""GreenEyedBiker"" if you love to bike and have green eyes.

, If you are creating an account at your school or business, sometimes it is best just to keep it simple by making your username your first initial and your last name. For example, if your name was Jane Smith, you could use ""jsmith.""To make this name more unique, add your middle initial or a number that bears significance to you.

, A great way to make your username more unique is to add numbers and symbols in the place of more complicated names. For instance, you can jazz up ""jsmith"" by turning it into ""j_smith35."" This is also a simple way to get that username you initially wanted but you were told that name has already been taken."

Schedule in-person gatherings with friends and family.,
Cook and eat dinner with your family.,
Make cards or write letters to send in the mail.,
Try a new club or hobby.",How to Stay Off Social Media1," Close relationships require a certain degree of emotional connection and intimacy. It’s hard to experience that when you’re mainly communicating through social media messages or status updates. Use your newfound free time to schedule a weekly get-together with the people who are most important to you.You can schedule one-on-one visits with family and friend as well as group gatherings. Ask your loved ones what’s been happening in their lives, and truly listen. Laugh and make eye contact. Hug one another when you depart. These aspects of social connection can’t be found online.;
, In many families, social media has even taken over the dinner table. Teens sneak their phones into their laps and adults have trouble detaching from their professional networks. Take back your family dinners, and forge deeper bonds with those you love.Prepare a meal together as a family, giving everyone a task. Talk as you ready your meal. Then, sit down and eat together. Comment on the taste and quality of the food before you. Have everyone share something interesting about their day.

, Getting something in the mail is almost a luxury in today’s technology-driven world. Surprise your loved ones with a special card or note to stay connected.

You might draw a picture (or have your child do so), make up a story or poem, or add your most current pictures to the package. This helps you stay connected without having to depend on social networks., If you’re a student, take advantage of your social media-free life to get involved in different extracurricular activities. If you’re an adult, consider joining a professional organization to build your network, or an interest-based group to pursue a hobby.

Getting involved in a local organization is a great way to connect with new people and enhance your personal skills. For instance, you might become a volunteer with Habitat for Humanity or sign up to join a local Toastmasters chapter.Try to engage in hobbies that are not internet related, such as a camping trip with friends, playing a board game, or learning a new musical instrument.

Unplug from social media for one week.",How to Stay Off Social Media2," If you really want to commit to staying off social media, it’s best to remove your profile from the network. Don’t worry, if you change your mind, this decision can usually be reversed. But, for the time being, it’s a good practice to prevent you from getting pulled back in., The majority of social media use comes from mobile devices like phones and tablets. As an extra measure, uninstall your social media apps from your devices. Because with many platforms, it’s quite easy to log back in and reactivate your account, completely removing the app is the safest bet.That way, if you’re tempted to reactivate your account, you’ll have several steps in place before you can successfully do so. Hopefully, you’ll recover your sense of resolve to stay off.

, As a final safeguard to stay off social media, look into an application for either your computer or smartphone that blocks other applications. Such apps are ideal for social media detoxes. You can completely block your access to a certain app or website, or you can limit access for a period of time.

Great options include SelfControl and Freedom., Taking a break from social media for one week can show you how much time you spend on this part of your life. You’ll likely find yourself having more free time and more meaningful interactions with others. If the week goes well, do another trial period of two weeks, gradually extending your time away from social media."
"
Be mindful.,
Recognize the impact of deeper, in-person connections.,
Notice an improved mood and sleep.,
Enjoy greater time-management and productivity.",How to Stay Off Social Media3," When you’re always tuned in to others’ news updates, thoughts, and feelings, you can get really disconnected from your own. One of the greatest benefits of logging off your social media accounts is better attention to the present moment.For instance, when most people wait in line or eat alone, they browse their social media feeds. When you don’t have that to fall back on, you are more aware of the surrounding environment as well as your own internal experience.
Social media can distract you from being bored, and unplugging may be stressful. Instead, use time away from social media to notice any uncomfortable feelings so you can address them head on.

, Social media removes the need to connect with people on a face-to-face basis. Coupled with texting, many young people don’t have much of an incentive to hang out with friends in real life. When you unplug from social media, you might notice yourself engaging in deeper conversations with those around you, and enjoying it., Being plugged in to social media around the clock limits you from being able to do mood-boosting activities like exercising, going outside, or getting adequate rest. Plus, you may develop negative feelings from comparing yourself to others’ highlight reels. When you log off, you might notice a lift in your mood and better sleep.Looking at devices with blue lights such as smartphones, computers, and tablets before bed threatens your sleep quality. By shutting down at least an hour before bed, you will enjoy more restful sleep.

, Social media is a major time-suck. You might commit to logging on for just 10 minutes, and, before you know it, an entire hour has elapsed. Staying off social media helps you use your time for more productive pursuits such as getting work done or completing chores.For example, once you quit social media, you might notice yourself getting your work done more efficiently and having more time to do the things you enjoy.

Without expectation, if you click on a link that redirects you to a page where you can log in to Twitter, just go back to the URL address bar and type twitter.com. Enter your username and password, and you'll be logged into Twitter.
Do not click on links to sites you don't know anything about. These sites could potentially be attack sites.

, If you do, burglars could potentially break in to your house and steal your valuables. If you must tell followers about when you won't be at home, use direct message or protect your tweets.

Upload a short narrative and accompanying photos.",How to Talk About Your Trip on Social Media," When you travel and share photos or anecdotes on social media, you may inadvertently let criminals know that your apartment or home is empty. To avoid compromising the security of your home and possessions, you should increase your social media security. This includes improving the security of your passwords and strengthening your privacy settings.You can increase password security by using anti-malware software, which protects against malware. Malware such as viruses and worms can quietly gather the passwords stored on your computer and distribute them to unknown parties, who will then have access to your accounts. To avoid this scenario, make sure you have good anti-malware installed. The top rated anti-malware software includes Hitman Pro, Malwarebytes, Zemana, Emsisoft, MSRT, and NPE. Ask a computer expert which one is appropriate for your computer and devices.Manage your passwords. You can use a password manager that regularly updates and stores passwords for you. You could also try using passphrases, which are easier to remember, and regularly update them. Poor passwords (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5) and passwords that are used repeatedly and not updated are prone to being stolen.Increase your privacy. Make sure your social media profiles are not visible to anyone except your friends. If your profiles are publicly visible, more people will see that you are on vacation which makes your property vulnerable to crime.;
, While you are on vacation, get someone to watch your apartment. You could ask a neighbor to keep an eye on the house or get a friend to house sit. In the event that someone uses your social media to determine vulnerable properties in your neighborhood and attempts a break-in, at least your friend or neighbor will be able to call the police., If you choose to share social media posts while travelling, you should avoid posting pictures of your friends and tagging them. You should at least ask your friends what security measures they have taken online and in terms of keeping their homes safe. If they haven’t taken any security measures, you don’t want to compromise their security inadvertently., The best way to ensure cybersecurity is to save your travel posts until you come back from your trip. At the end of your trip, you can look over your travel journal and curate pictures from key moments on the trip. Your friends will probably prefer this approach since their feeds will not be overwhelmed with excessive travel shares.If you must share during your trip, make sure you have somebody house sitting and avoid posting pictures of friends or family members who may not have someone watching their house.

, Record your travel experiences and the details of your trip in a journal. At the end of the trip, you can use a few of the stories recorded in your travel journal to write a compelling social media post about your trip. In your travel journal, you could record the dates, times, places, costs, and other details of your journey. You can keep a travel journal as a paper journal or on a laptop or device.As a prompt to write in your journal, you could think about whether there was a theme for the day. A theme might be unexpected encounters, exhaustion, or learning moments. Once you have your theme, expand on it.To spark reflection for your journal, ask yourself: “What was special about today?”

, Rather than writing about and taking pictures of everything on your journey or of touristy spots, follow your genuine interests. If you are passionate about architecture, take photographs of the local architecture. If you are passionate about wildlife, take pictures of local wildlife. If you love dogs, take pictures of local dogs and dog culture., Follow your creative instinct in your travel journal and with your camera. In your journal, challenge yourself to think about the nuances of your conversations and about the little things you observed during the day. With your camera, challenge yourself to get creative by taking shots from down low, up high, zooming in, and shooting slightly out of focus. In this way, you can make interesting shots, even if the location is a familiar spot that everyone will know like the Eiffel Tower or the Brooklyn Bridge.If there is a tourist landmark you want to shoot, take a picture from your boots. Get down low and shoot the monument from down low to make it look more imposing and impressive.Use a monopod extender or just your arm and shoot the scene from up high. You could also try getting up on a bridge to shoot a scene from higher up.Keep your camera still but zoom in or out on your subject while taking the picture. This will create a sense of movement in your photograph, which can look quite compelling.Try shooting your subject intentionally out of focus so that it has a blurry look. If you are shooting a landmark, people will probably still recognize it., Pictures of your feet dangling by the resort pool, your feet in the sand by the ocean, or the Eiffel Tower are examples of cliché shots. Everyone has seen these pictures so you should avoid sharing them. If you take and share cliché shots, your friends will be less likely to be engaged in your travel story. You can take the pictures and keep them to yourself as private memories., Nobody wants to see you sipping champagne in an airport lounge or enjoying a really expensive meal at a five star restaurant. The pleasure of social media is built on common experiences as opposed to unique and rare experiences. People can feel alienated if you post a lot of photos of really exceptional, rare, or expensive sorts of experiences. So, it is best to avoid bragging with your photos., Your friends know what you look like. They want to see the place and the landscape as opposed to another selfie or your tan. You should avoid sharing too many selfies. If you take a lot of selfies, you can keep them as private memories instead of sharing them., Nobody wants to see another hotel room picture. Hotel pictures are simply boring, regardless of whether it is especially fancy or just a run of the mill hotel., Use your travel journal and your travel photos to tell the story of your trip. Review your travel journal to identify some of the key themes you wrote about and look through your photographs to identify how these themes are represented. Think about the introduction and overall plot of your story. The plot of your trip may revolve around the meanings of a place or around a particular relationship. While reviewing your photos and overall plot, consider relational themes, locational themes, stylistic and visual themes:Visual themes relate to the colours and textures captured in your shots.
Stylistic themes relate to particular styles and techniques used in the photographs.
Locational themes relate to the types of places that interested you on the trip such as beaches, markets, restaurants, or museums.
Relational themes relate to interpersonal relationships such as friendship or marriage.

, Before sharing your trip on social media, tell a close friend about the experience. Then, ask your close friend what they think the important themes might be based on what you talked about. If your friend is a good listener, they may be able to give you some tips on what stories and themes to talk about in your social media post.

, Spend an afternoon reviewing your travel journal. Highlight stories that you want to keep to yourself and stories that you want to share with friends. Highlight stories that you want to share on social media. Once you have figured out the stories you want to share on social media, think about the tone you want to use in your social media post. For example, think about whether you want your tone to be reflective, upbeat, comedic, or philosophical.

, You don’t want to overwhelm your audience, so you should be selective and choose only one or two pictures from each day of your trip. If you give your friends too many pictures of your trip, they may not look at them., You don’t want your social media post to simply show off the expensive or unique trip that you took. The social media post should not be curated in such a way that people will feel jealous or alienated from your life. To avoid this, you should cut out pictures of especially expensive objects or events and focus more on your experience.By focusing on your personal experience of the trip and the relationships you built on vacation, your travel post should be much more relatable.

, Think about the pictures that convey the feeling and key themes of your trip. When you edit these pictures into a social media story, your friends should have the feeling that they are travelling with you vicariously., Drawing from your travel journal, write a short reflection on your trip. You don’t want this to be too long (e.g., no longer than 250 words), but it should offer a nice personal reflection on the experience. Rather than posting multiple posts about the trip, simply post one solid post at the end of your trip. In this post, include a curated selection of travel shots that tell the story of your trip in relation to key themes and experiences.If you are using Instagram, you should write a one sentence narrative per photograph. You can upload a few photographs all at once at the end of your trip, but it is best to be selective so you don't overwhelm your friends' feeds.
If you are using Snapchat, you can create a short video reflection on your trip.
If you are using Twitter, you could reflect on all of your photos and your journal and then offer a short tweet about a learning experience from the trip.

Make offline networking a priority.,
Build your online network.,
Be aware of artificial closeness.,
Keep your emotions in check.,
Avoid online comparisons.",How to Stop Social Media from Damaging Your Offline Behavior1," When you make connections online, you often feel instantly connected to another person. It can take much longer to feel a meaningful connection in person. Though it might seem frustrating to wait for in person connections to blossom, it is still important to cultivate them. Talk to people at work or school and make it a point to attend social gatherings regularly to meet new people.Try making it a rule that you will accept all social invitations you receive for a set period of time. For example, if you are invited to a party, then go and make an agreement that you will stay for at least an hour and see if you have fun. Make sure to keep your phone in your pocket the whole time to ensure that you can give your full attention to the people who are there.;
, Social media gives you access to millions of new contacts, any of which could become friends, business partners, or colleagues. Each network has its unique strengths. For example, you could use Facebook to make friends, as it connects you to friends of friends and gives you the option to join groups on special topics, like at home science projects.Another example would be to try LinkedIn if you are looking for business contacts. It is great for networking and even lets you search potential jobs.

, The closeness you feel online is not always genuine. Many social media sites will use an algorithm of some kind to match you to people with similar interests. This can give you the illusion of an immediate, deep connection. You need to keep in mind that it takes a lot of time to truly know a person, especially if you don’t meet them in person.Also be aware that some people deliberately use social media to create false identities to scam other users.
Protect yourself emotionally by checking your expectations for your relationships, and comparing them with the way that people actually behave. You may find that other people do not reciprocate your feelings.

, If you let it, social media can have a huge influence over your emotions. The good news is that you can use these emotions to gauge how healthy your social media usage is. If you notice yourself being too emotionally invested in things happening on social media, it is time to step back and unplug for a bit.For example, if you are extremely sad because someone on your news feed posted that they are having a bad day, social media might be influencing your emotions too strongly.
You can also try doing a debriefing session after using social media. Check in with yourself to see how you are feeling. Are you now upset in some way? Is your concentration or productivity impaired after using social media? These can be signs that social media is having a negative effect on you.

, Social media allows every person to paint themselves how they want to be seen. Many people take full advantage of this and use their social media to project the image of a perfect, blissful life. While in some cases the person might really feel this way, you certainly shouldn’t be discouraged in your own life just because you see someone who looks happier on social media."

Stay in touch with social media.,
Tell your story through social media.,
Go easy on the details.,
Unplug often.,
Guard against jealousy and distrust.,
Use social media as a way to connect with people offline.",How to Stop Social Media from Damaging Your Offline Behavior2," Family, close friends, and lovers can all benefit from social media. You can use social media to stay in touch through busy times, and even across long distances. This can help you to nurture relationships that would otherwise be put on hold.For example, you can keep in touch with your parents and friends when you move out of state to go to college or take a job.

, Research suggests that people who share details about their relationships on social media tend to be happier. Take this opportunity to share a bit about yourself and a loved one from time to time. It might make both of you happier., Research also suggests that people who share too much about their personal lives and relationships on social media are not well liked. Strike a balance by going easy on the details when you post about yourself and loved ones. You can also post about other things, too. This will help your online friends and followers see that you aren’t only posting about your own personal life.It is especially important to avoid sharing details on conflict within your family or between you and your partner. Review your posts before sharing to make sure you are not using social media as a way to vent about these kinds of personal issues.

, Your relationships with friends and family take time and energy to thrive. So do your romantic relationships. You need to limit your time on social media and unplug frequently to allow yourself the time and energy to invest in your intimate relationships.You and your partner could agree on a time that will be “screen free” and set aside for the two of you to connect.

, The downside of social media, especially in romantic relationships, is that it can foster worries. If you or your partner has jealous tendencies, make sure to keep an open dialogue about social media usage. Avoid using social media too much around your partner, as this takes time and attention away from them. You should also be conscientious about whom you spend your time talking to on social media.Identify some basic rules that you and your partner can follow to maintain appropriate social media behavior.

, If you find it hard to make friends in person, then using social media as a way to connect with people offline can be a good option. Try using social media to meet people who share your interests, such as by joining an online group for hikers or video game enthusiasts. Or, use social media to find and connect with old friends."

Create camara free times.,
Take pictures and video the old fashioned way.,
Agree that certain things remain private.",How to Stop Social Media from Damaging Your Offline Behavior3," Offline censorship happens when people are acting a certain way because of fear of being recorded and put on social media. This can be serious since anyone from your mother to your boss can look at your social media accounts. Try to plan some family or friend time without smartphones or cameras. That way, everyone is free to act as they normally would without fear of being recorded., People want to take pictures and video at some important events, like parties or vacations. If you don’t want this media ending up on social media, you could insist that everyone use cameras that use film to take pictures. This will help ensure that content isn’t directly uploaded to social media, since it isn’t digital., Smartphones and digital cameras/recorders are very popular and convenient. Perhaps the best way to go about handling offline censorship is to agree ahead of time that no one will post their pictures or videos to social media. Just make sure that you trust the people around to keep their promise."

Reflect on what these social networks have been doing to you.,
Start a gradual process of leaving social networks.,
Go outside.,
There are some family members and relatives who are too far away for you to give them a visit.,
Find a hobby.,
Go exploring.,
Don't give up.",How to Socialise Without Social Networks," How has it affected your daily routine, and think about the things which you could have been doing if you weren't so obsessed with these social networks such as:


Learning a new language
Learning how to cook
Becoming healthier
Read
Dance;
, For example, if you go on Facebook for 3 hours, go on it for 2 hours and 30 minutes, then slowly get off it. Substitute the time you were on Facebook for something else (such as the ideas mentioned above). This way, you will see there are so much more interesting things to do, and you can let go off the social networks.

, Learn how to become a people person. At first it may be hard, but as you get the practice it will soon become easier. Start with something simple as when you are waiting on the cue, and the person in front of you looks friendly. Or perhaps you could join a group; that way you will meet people with the same interests as you. It's not about becoming popular; it's about realising you can have an awesome conversation without it being online.

, So why not make a phone call? If you don't have theirs yet, ask through a social network, but be disciplined enough to get off as soon as possible. Imagine how they would feel when you call to ask them how they are. It makes a person feel more important and strengthens the relationship between you and the relative.

, You can do this by joining a group, or just at home, with the examples mentioned in Step 1. Analyse what your talents are and work at them, breathe, eat and sleep them. Make sure it is something you enjoy, not something you think will impress people. After all, if you enjoy and become awesome at it, it will become impressing no matter how unusual it is.

, Visit a new city or country. Take pictures of wonderful sights (with a camera not a phone so you won't be tempted to post in Instagram), try new food, meet people from other cultures instead of adding people you don't know from other countries on Facebook. Being in a different place will distract you, as you are in a different environment.

, Staying away from social networks, may be a hard task. But it will be worth it in the end. There might be times where you won't resist and you take a sneak peek which will turn into an hour. Just get back up and you'll soon see how great life can be without depending on social networks!

Determine your objective for jumping into the social media world.,
Open up accounts on the major social media sites.,
Update your profile information.,
Use a good profile photograph.,
Put yourself out there, and start friend requesting people.,
Post meaningful content.,
Follow up with people who friend request or message you, like or comment on other people's posts, and try to check your account at least once or twice per day.

",How to Soar With Social Media," Do you want to use it to enhance your business? Are you looking to start a new relationship? Are you wanting to use it to make or connect with old friends.


Each objective will require you to tailor the next instructions to your specific need, but putting yourself out there is the first step to success.;
,


Log-in your information and open an account on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Other sites you might consider later include YouTube to post your videos, Flickr to post your photographs, digg, meetup or de.licio.us.
If you enjoy writing, consider a free blog on a site such as Wordpress.com as well. Blogs require time and dedication to maintain, so only commit to one if you think you can devote the time to it.

,


Be truthful. That is a golden rule. The objective is not to misrepresent yourself. Instead it is to make your credentials shine, to network and to build connections based on mutual respect, not lies.
Be thorough. By including such details such as your high school, college and place of employment, you can access friend request tools that let you target specifically the people from your past and present.
Be witty. Whether you are looking to find a mate, looking to impress co-workers or trying to stand out online, use your creative skills to make a positive impression when describing yourself.

, They say that a picture says a thousand words, and this especially holds true when making online first impressions.


Ask a friend or family member to take a headshot for you. Don't hold the camera phone a foot from your face and snap your own pic. Don't hold the camera phone to the mirror and take your picture that way either. Instead, choose a good background like the woods, or a grassy area, and have someone take your headshot looking down at you. This angle will help avoid a double chin, and it gives you a subtle background that rocks your profile picture.

,


On Facebook, you can friend request anyone, but it is up to them whether or not to accept your friend request. Facebook also has other tools such as searching through your email accounts to send messages to your friends to network with you. You can also search by your high school or college to make additional connections.
On Facebook, once you start making connections, the software will begin to recommend people that it thinks you might want to be friends with based on who has already friended you. This is a great way to build your connections.
On Twitter, you can ""follow"" anyone's Twitter feeds that you would like. Most people will follow you back if you choose to follow their site, so following a large amount of people is the first step to getting your own followers.
LinkedIn is based on existing connections, so it will only allow you to connect with people that you know. If there is someone that you would like to connect with, though, you can simply message a current contact to make the electronic introduction for you.

, No one wants to know that you just ate a sandwich, but if you ate a sandwich at a popular new deli and wanted to rave about the establishment, that makes it a meaningful comment.

Provide quality content.,
Use keywords.,
Complete your profile.,
Add links.,
Use hashtags.",How to Optimize Your Social Media Sites," The most important part of any social media marketing has to do with the content you post. Your content should engage and delight the reader and should not focus primarily on selling your products. Your content should help establish you as a leader in the industry. When consumers are ready to buy, they trust you have the most experience in the industry and the right products to match their need.
, Do you want your profile to show up in at the top of search results? Keyword optimization can be somewhat helpful, depending on the platform used. For social media sites like Twitter and LinkedIn, the space below your name or Twitter handle is great for adding relevant keywords. If you are in the consumer electronics industry for example, you may want to add ‘consumer electronics’ and any other expertise you specialize in under your name. When people search for keywords you are related to, your profile will show up higher in the search results., With any social media site you are using, an incomplete profile will reflect poorly on your business. Start with a great profile and background photo. Since this is the first thing people will notice, it is important that it reflects your brand well. Information about who you are and what your company does is important too. If people are discovering you or your brand for the first time, make sure they can easily understand what you do with a complete profile., Many people visiting social media profiles want to visit the company’s website after checking out their page. Adding a link to your website from your social media page makes it easy for potential customers who want to learn more about your company. Adding links to your profile pages also help your search engine optimization results as well. The more links you have pointing to your website the better., Hashtags can be used in Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Instagram. Hashtags allow you to emphasize important keywords in a sentence or summarize your post by adding a hashtagged word at the end. Hashtags group posts together based on the words people are using. People can also search hashtags based on subjects they are interested in. Stick to a maximum of three hashtags per post."

Think about your location and surroundings.,
Use a pose that flatters you.,

Write something interesting to go along with your selfie.",How to Practice Good Selfie Etiquette," There are certain times and locations where others will consider selfie-taking rude, disrespectful, or otherwise antisocial. You should avoid taking selfies here like the plague. Here are some examples:


Funerals and memorials (too solemn)
Bathroom toilet (distasteful)
Driving (too reckless);
, What you think looks right might not to other people. Ask for a second opinion before posting it everywhere.

, You don't want to get a shot with something stuck in your teeth. If you're going to be taking a picture of yourself, you might as well look your best.

, If you frequently add or change pictures, it can annoy others and they may begin to see you as narcissistic and in need of attention.

, They can look okay occasionally, but using them too much makes it seem like you're trying too hard. Black and white/sepia may be useful if the colors surrounding you are too distracting or you have facial features that don't benefit from vibrant color (like acne).

, This gives anyone who comes across your photo something to enjoy or be entertained by. Here are some ideas:


A story about where you are (if you're on a trip/away from home)
Something new that has changed in your life (picture with your new car/pet/house/weight loss)
A new item of clothing you really like (especially if someone gifted it to you)
A famous quote that summarizes something about what you're thinking/expressing/doing/wearing.

Recognize toxic behavior for what it is.,
Understand that a toxic person’s behavior isn’t personal.,
Set boundaries.,
Focus on solutions.,
Avoid seeking the person’s approval.,
Think carefully before you get involved with a toxic person.,
Respond with politeness.,
Know you’re not obligated to validate a toxic person.,
Avoid initiating conversation with toxic people.,
Identify toxic friends.,
Unfollow people whose posts bring you down.,
Unfriend or block people you don’t want any contact with.,
Surround yourself with positive people.",How to Handle Toxic People on Social Media," If someone’s posts, comments, and messages consistently make you feel worse than you did before, you’re probably dealing with a toxic person. A few common signs of a toxic personality include lying frequently, putting others down, and being excessively pessimistic.For instance, if someone you know is constantly posting gloomy, self-pitying statuses on Facebook to get attention, they may be toxic.
A person isn’t necessarily toxic just because you dislike them. Rather, a toxic person is someone who saps your energy or brings out the worst in you.
Identify how you feel after reading or listening to this person's posts, comments, or messages. Do you feel drained, tired, unmotivated, worthless, or depressed? If so, this person is more than likely toxic and you may need to remove them from your friend list on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and so on.;
, It’s easy to take someone else’s toxicity personally, but their behavior says more about them than it does about you. They probably act the same way with everyone else, too.For instance, you might feel annoyed if an old friend always tries to one-up you when you post about your successes in life. However, comments like these are rooted in the other person’s insecurity and aren’t actually about you.

, Don’t let toxic people demand all of your attention. Decide what you can tolerate from your negative friends and family members, and stand firm on your limits.For example, you might tell a family member that you won’t reply anymore when they try to start political arguments with you.
Toxic people often disregard boundaries, so be prepared to stand up for yourself if someone tries to push your limits.

, Refuse to dwell on negativity, even if that’s clearly what the other person wants. You can often shut down complainers by asking them how they plan to fix a bad situation.For instance, if your brother messages you every day about how he hates his job, say something like, “That sounds hard to deal with. What do you think you could do to make the situation better?”
If the person refuses to try to solve the problem, politely excuse yourself by saying something like, “Well, I’ve got to go. Hope you find a solution!”

, You don’t need to humor a toxic person, even if they’re a family member or longtime friend. If their behavior is wearing you out, don’t feel pressured to like their post or reply to their message, even if that upsets them.Seeking the approval of a toxic person can backfire, as they’ll be more likely to keep pestering you in the future.

, If you know someone is prone to starting drama, consider whether engaging with them on social media is worth it. It might be best to avoid sending them a friend request or commenting on their post in the first place., If a toxic person tries to stir up trouble with you, don’t give them any ammunition. Reply to a critical or competitive remark by saying something neutral or positive. If you refuse to play their game, they’ll move on and bother someone else.For instance, if your sister-in-law frequently leaves comments on your posts implying that her kids are smarter than yours, it might make your blood boil. However, it’s still best to avoid a fight by replying, “Sounds like your kids are doing well. Have a good day!”

, You don’t have to boost anyone’s ego, listen to excessive self-pity, or get involved in other people’s arguments. If you don’t like the way a conversation or comment thread is going, don’t feel guilty about excusing yourself.If someone is pressuring you to agree with them, consider being honest about your disagreement. They might get upset, but they probably won’t ask you to indulge them in the future.
For instance, you could tell a chronic complainer, “Well, actually, I do think you could do something to change your situation.”
If someone tries to draw you into drama that doesn’t pertain to you, you can just say, “That’s none of my business,” or “I’d rather not get involved.”

, Don’t start a conversation with a toxic person unless you have to. If they start a conversation with you, keep your responses brief and polite. Don’t ask them more questions than necessary, and make it clear when you’re done talking.For instance, you can signal that a conversation is over by saying something like, “Well, I’ve got to go study with a classmate now. Nice talking with you!”
While avoiding conversation with certain toxic people may be beneficial, there are certain circumstances where you may want to consider having a discussion with the toxic person. For instance, if the toxic person is a friend whom you’ve had in your life for a long time, then something may have happened in their life to bring on the toxic behavior. In this situation, maybe your friend will be open to discussing how their toxic personality is affecting your relationship.
Keep in mind that you will need to be prepared to hear both positive and negative feedback, and you need to be able to provide the same introspection. Approaching the toxic person with this type of compassion and willingness to resolve the issue honestly, will help you find ways to stop their toxic pattern without the loss of friendship.

, Once or twice a year, go through your friend list and ask yourself whether you’re glad to have all of these people in your life. If you dread receiving messages from certain people, or if there are a few friends you always end up arguing with online, they may be toxic., If you don’t want to hurt someone’s feelings by unfriending them on Facebook, you can unfollow them instead. When you unfollow someone, you remain friends with them, but you stop seeing their posts in your news feed.People can’t tell when you unfollow them.

, If you want to cut contact with someone, remove them from your friend list. Block them if you don’t want to see any of their posts or comments anymore.If you’re on a social media site other than Facebook, unfriending might be the only way to stop seeing someone’s posts.
Don’t feel obligated to explain yourself when you unfriend someone. The other person may just try to draw you into an argument.

, Instead of dwelling on a few people’s negative behavior, seek out friends and family members who improve your life. When you surround yourself with positivity, you’ll be less affected by other people’s toxic behavior, both on the internet and in real life."

Be consistent.",How to Increase Your Followers on Social Media," Tweets with hashtags are 55% more likely to be retweeted, because they make your content more searchable - increasing the chances of non-followers finding you.


Images on Instagram that include hashtags get more likes than images that do not. The top three being - #followforfollow, #likeforlike and #follow4follow.;
, Tweets with 100 to 115 characters are 34% more likely to be retweeted than those outside that range. A shorter Tweet allows people to add their own comment when retweeting.

, Adding a celebrities name works wonders for encouraging people to click. The only thing more effective, in fact, was is promise tweets (e.g lose 6lbs if you do this).

, Captions just make it easier for pinners to discover your new stuff. More than 11,000 Pinterest users found that those with the most repins were under 200 words and included hashtags like #recipe #chicken.

, Taller images on Pinterest garner more repins simply because they jump out more. 800 pixels = optimum.

, The most repinned images have multiple colors, while red, orange and brown images are twice as likely to be repinned than blue.

, For Instagram, choose a theme for your account; If people choose to follow you it will be for a reason. Whether that's fashion, food or travel, feed what attracted the audience.

, Try different poses but try to make sure your feet/ shoes are in the picture. Lots of Look bookers only hype if the shoes are shown. Try a collage look, and have your shoes in a separate photo if you can't have a head-to-toe photo. Make sure it goes by the rules too. Only edit your photo if you really have to, but it is best if you don't so you can see the colours properly.

, A good time for this is midday to evening time. As there are people from all over the world on it, it will get seen by someone. Also try to have a good, interesting title and add a descriptive piece on why you chose the outfit or what made you choose it.

, Don't worry if you don't get any hypes within the first few minutes. It will take time to get popular. Just keep trying. Good Luck :)

Keep your pins highly relevant in the group board.,
Consider starting your group board in secret.,
Keep guidelines very simple and open for the members.,
Remove repeat offenders from the group if required.,
Mention your contact details.",How to Use Pinterest Group Boards for Ecommerce Website," As a group admin, it is your task to police them and ensure that your group keeps pulling the interest of the members. Irregular and careless monitoring can make your pins go off-brand, out-of-fashion and thus, ignored. This is even important in a group with lots of pinners. The best way to avoid your pins being ignored is to screen every pinner before adding them to the group. Make sure that all pins are not spammy and have decent quality content.;
, This step has a number of benefits. By opening a group in private, you get an opportunity to collect niche relevant pins for it. Once you think you have enough pins; you can open your group and start sending out invites to the users. This way, you will have some content in-hand to attract pinners to become valued contributors.

, For you are as a group admin, it is important to set a few rules for your board members. You can mention them in the ""Description"" box on your board. There should be a ""no spamming policy"" but make sure that you don’t just write ""no spamming"" and stop. You should mention straightforward anti-spamming guidelines and keep checking your pins regularly. Then, you should also have guidelines related to how many pins a pinner can contribute in a day. This will also help you maintain the quality of your board.

, By removing those who continually break your rules and ignore guidelines, you send a message to your group that you are not there to tolerate any spam activity on your board. You need to remove everyone who creates a nuisance or violates the spirit of your group. You will also have to pay attention towards the quality of your pins. One of the biggest drawbacks of Pinterest boards is that the board members can send out invites to other members to join your board. Thus, you have to control your board very strictly and this is very important because Pinterest reserves the right to shut down any board that has been marked as ""Spam"" a fixed number of times.

, You need to make sure that you mention your contact details in the ""Description"" box on the board you manage. This will encourage members and non-members to contact you via email and share their views and ideas etc.

Change your profile picture often, in order to reflect different events in your life.,
When choosing your network, always choose your school or college as your primary network.,
Show your birthday, so that people can greet you on that special day.

,
Be careful when filling out ""interested in"", ""relationship status"" and ""looking for"" criteria.,
If you are in a relationship, don't list yourself as single.,
Be selective with your quotes.,
Make sure everything is punctuated correctly.U don't want ur stnces 2 luk lke ths!

",How to Facelift Your Facebook," For example, show a picture in your cap and gown the day that you graduate. This gives the impression that you are often doing something. However, it is best to have one standard picture to revert back to after you show your novelty one a few days.

, Geographical networks tend to be looser and detract from your sense of connection.

,, The ""interested in"" is redundant unless you are not heterosexual. Saying that you are ""looking for"" a relationship makes you look desperate, so listing yourself as ""single"" should suffice. Sometimes it's best not to fill out this part. If it's not something you'll say to a classmate, then don't write it down.

, This is cruel for those who might be pursuing you.

, Five or six is enough, and make sure they are not inside jokes.

Limit your time playing to an hour a day.,
Turn off the email notifications.

,
Try to log in only once every couple of days so that you break the habit of playing every day.,
Do something else internet related but more satisfyingly interesting, like reading Wikipedia.,
Uninstall the applications from your Facebook account.

,
During the times you would have been playing Zynga games, think of something else to do, like homework or reading a book.

",How to Stop Being Addicted to Zynga Games," Make sure you have done all your chores and work before you log on.;
,, Also, try to log into Facebook only once every couple of days to avoid seeing the reminders there to play.

, Or, play a proper computer game with good content and graphics, such as a flight simulator or, if you like violence, a first-person shooter to get your fill of gaming. Even one a few years old will be far ahead of a console game, which are themselves pretty amazing, and the older ones will run on almost any computer. (These can be somewhat addicting too, but are very fun rather than just fun enough to keep you clicking.)

Stay in touch.",How to Use Facebook for Business Networking," Assuming you don't know much about Facebook for business the first thing you have to do is begin to get used to Facebook to understanding it's concept. You will create a professional account. Take time to define your goals and ways to achieve them. If you have no idea where to start, check the Facebook pages of leading companies in the use of Facebook (Coca Cola, Starbucks, etc.), or companies in your industry, and see their strategies. This will help you to familiarize how it is used and how you can apply techniques.;
, Customize your page (logo, tags, URL, etc.) This will help you to achieve your goals.

, Many small businesses use Facebook as a way to network with their community, customers, charities and business partners. Contractors or professionals use a profile as a way to develop important business contacts.

, Think of your Facebook page as an online resume or a business card. Make sure the following elements are considered as part of your professional page:


Only elect to use a personal page if you do not have a business, and you want to network with other professionals. Create the personal page as if it is a resume. Remove excessive pictures, such as those with drinking, partying or vacations. Add education, work experience, your website, professional organizations and important hobbies.
Go to the ""General Settings"" and ""Privacy Settings"" in order to control what people can see on your personal profile. This is essential for anyone using a personal profile. You can also make lists, using the ""Friends"" section of your homepage, and choose if you want certain lists, such as friends or co-workers, to be unable to see your status update.
Facebook created ""Fan Pages"" to help businesses, charities and organizations to develop a following for their business on the Internet. Choose the type of company, upload logos and pictures associated with your company. Assign someone to consistently post to your site.
Complete your info sections of your profile. On either personal or business pages, this is the place where people are likely to look first. Incomplete or cryptic information sections are often thought to be Facebook spam accounts. Consider your ""About Me"" section to be an elevator pitch, telling people in just a few short lines what you do, why you do it and why you are a good professional contact to have. If you are a company, put your company defined pitch or brand in this section.
Link other social media applications, eBay and more by downloading Facebook applications. In a professional setting, you should use the event application and research other applications that can help you cross-promote with your current marketing initiatives.
Post photos of yourself or your employees to give your business a stronger brand image. Make sure all photos are in a professional setting, and they can do a lot to give the feeling of community and credibility to your page. They can also promote corporate culture and a happy workplace.

, Before you start asking for friends or fans, you should have 20, or so, posts that tell your potential contacts about your interests. Consider posting industry information, educational links, links to current projects or products.

, Each fan page is allowed to change their page name only once, so make sure you use the name of your company, website or blog. For example, instead of Facebook.com/5525412814559, you can make your site Facebook.com/MarketingMaven.


Click ""Edit Page"" and then choose ""Basic Information."" You can change your URL under the ""Username"" option.

, Send friend requests or share a fan page with them, to start getting an initial base for business networking. These people are more likely than a new friend to share your page or help you promote your business.


Use Facebook's ""Invite Email Contacts"" link to help you connect with colleagues. You can choose to link your account with your email provider for a set period of time. They will help you find colleagues or contacts that are also on Facebook.

, Although you want to be selective, these sections are developed based on networking principles that ""friends of friends"" may also be good friends to have.

, When you see their Facebook pages, click the ""Like"" button. They will get a notification that you are a fan, and they will have a chance to ""like"" you, in turn.


Becoming fans of other businesses will allow you to be associated with them. You will often be listed as a fan on their page, which can be a great way to convert their fans into your fans.

, As you make new contacts, you should cross-promote your non-Facebook services. Blog, or informal, writing is a great way to promote your business, because it is usually not a hard sell and it can be used as Search Engine Optimization (SEO) on your website.

, With an easy to find URL, it is likely that people will see that you have a Facebook page. A number of those people may look at your Facebook page for promotions and business updates, and/or become your fans.


Connect with influential people in your industry (other companies or professionals in your field, ""bloggers"", journalists, etc.). Build relationships in sourcing interesting information and share your network with them, and they will return the favor.
Put a link to your website from your Facebook Page (Fan Page) for your potential customers to visit your website. Sometimes even a Facebook page has more visitors than a website. Also, take advantage of your Facebook page to insert links to the latest articles in your blog, promotions on your website to promote your site visit. In fact you don't actually have to set it up if you don't want and instead you can outsource the task of paying an affordable fee to have one done professionally, such as through Elance.com. or Fiverr.com.

, Facebook groups are communities that promote discussions. You can use a group to develop a professional community, a regional business network, a product, a professional advice group, a market research group or a club.

, With most Facebook groups, you must ask to join and the administrator will either accept or deny your request for admission. Get into discussions with people in your groups, in order to develop valuable business contacts.

, Announce on your page if you will be traveling to a conference or expo. You can arrange for in-person networking through Facebook on your wall or through direct messaging.

, Encourage people who've never seen your business in person to meet in a social setting. Also, ask that your friends or fans pass on the invitation to their friends.

, If you are finding that Facebook networking is working well for you, then their low-cost advertising may create an even bigger following. Facebook ads for fan pages, group pages or events add new followers in your target audience or create a buzz around them.

, After participating with comments. Do not worry, not everyone gives interesting information, and you can begin to lead sharing information of value to the group (links to news, blogs, photos, videos, etc..) Take advantage of course to inform them of your value blog, your company, your services.


For example, if you have a blog on ""Animal Care"" and you're in a group like ""I love animals"", you are able to give interesting information about the care of dogs, pet stories, news about welfare groups animals, etc. The people in this group or community, begin to identify yourself as a professional in the field, and when they or their friends need of advice about the ""animal care"", or will recommend you seek.

, Companies with more fans on Facebook are those who respond to their customers. Through continuous interaction, as a company can show ""Next"" to your customers and concerned about their problems. This in effect increase your business reputation with increased brand perception.


If you think it would be interesting for your company, create a group around a shared interest potential customers of your business. This will allow you to meet a potential market, which can send interesting information about your products and / or services. Plus you'll build a reputation as a leader, sharing important information for its members, information that you already have because the group has been created for you, for your sector. Thus members recommend you and your audience will grow.

Don't rush into every hand.,
While it may not be possible to see your opponents in person, observe the moves they make and you may notice some players have a tendency to bluff.,
Lure your opponent into a false sense of security.,
Do not go all in on pocket pairs.,
PRACTISE!",How to Win a Zynga Poker Sit and Go Tournament," If you do not have to contribute to the blinds, fold if you have a weak hand. This will help you to conserve your chips. It is possible to fold and flop a good hand, but unfortunately sometimes this may happen. (I folded a straight flush doing this). The important thing is, I won the sit and go.;
, Once you have a feel for each player and how they play, you can plan the way you will play hands.

, If you have a good hand, check, your opponent will probably raise just to get the pot and may not expect you to raise them back.

, Many people may get pocket aces, but going all in may not be the best idea. Any of your opponents could have pocket kings and see another king or even two on the community cards. It is also important to bear in mind, the more players left at the table, the less chance you have of winning. It may sound a bit pessimistic, but playing sensibly will pay off.

, Start out at small buy in games, preferably with 5 players, not 9. Eventually you will become more confident in your ability and start to rake in the cash.

Understand The Basics: There are several things to keep in mind if you want to level up quickly in FarmVille.,
Focus on Experience : When you want to build up experience points quickly in FarmVille, you have to supplement what you gain from your normal harvests with other activities.,
You should also take experience points into consideration when deciding which crops to plant.,
Always put Attention: You have to be on top of your harvesting and planting cycles in order to make progress this way though.",How to Level up Really Quick in Farmville," You probably already know that in order to level up, you need to accumulate experience points. For example, each plot of land you plow gets you one experience point. In the early stages of game play, the number of experience points you get by plowing land and planting crops is plenty to allow you to advance at a reasonable pace. Once you get through the initial stages though, you start to need more and more experience points to level up.;
, Making improvements to your farm is a good way to gain some quick chunks of experience points. Buildings yield the most, but you can get experience from putting up just about any decoration or structure. You just have to pay close attention to the amounts of experience points each item will deliver.

, Crops that take less than a day to grow only yield 1 experience point, while crops that take longer yield 2. That doesn't mean you only want to plant crops that offer 2 experience points however. If you can get back and harvest them as soon as they're ready, crops like strawberries will get you more than 2 experience points a day because you can harvest them every 4 hours.

, Putting up buildings on your farm remains the best way to get big boosts in your experience quickly. Save up your cash for those, and you'll be well on your way to unlocking all of the available items in FarmVille.

Buy as many items as you can.,

Decide how many storage buildings you'll have.,
Set aside some space on your farm for your storage buildings and don't place other items in the reserved space.,
Pick the type of building you want based on what will look best on your farm.,
Continue to add storage as needed but be realistic.",How to Make the Best Use of Your Storage Space in Farmville," This will enable you to that you can rack up those experience points quickly. It's important to buy the items that you think will add the most aesthetically to your farm, as well as considering experience points.;
, Storage is needed to stop creating a cramped environment. You'll quickly find that no matter how good the items you buy look individually, it's hard to make them all look good when they're jammed together. This is because there is simply no space left to display the items properly. So that's when you'll need to take advantage of your storage buildings.

, The amount of space you have available for storage will depend on the number of storage buildings you have. How many you have will depend on how much space you have to put up those buildings. With a little careful planning, you can make this arrangement work out thoroughly to your advantage.

, The buildings all look like they belong on a farm, so don't feel as if they'll spoil the overall appearance of your farm.


For example, you can use a barn or a shed as a storage building.

, Putting up the buildings will get you a good measure of experience too, so they actually benefit you in a couple of ways.

, You can put up extra buildings to store more stuff as you accumulate it. But at a certain point, you'll have to start choosing what to store and what to sell off. After all, the whole point of having storage buildings is to create some extra space on your farm. You don't want to just turn around and fill up that space you worked so hard to create. You'll be able to buy most items again if you want them later on, so the best ones to store are generally things that are seasonal in nature and won't be available to purchase the next time you want to be able to display them.

Android - Tap the ""+"" button in the Recent tab and select ""Search."" Search for ""M"" and select it from the ""Bots"" section. You may have to scroll down to see this section in the results.
M is currently only available as part of a limited beta. In order to join, you'll need to be either invited directly by Facebook, or you'll need an invite from someone else already using it. Availability is expected to increase in the future., M is designed to interact with you like a real person would, using natural language. You can ask M questions, look something up, ask for recommendations, and more. Just send M a message like you would anyone else in Messenger. With M, you don't have to worry about phrasing your question in just the right way so that the computer understands it.

You can have call customer service lines for you. For example, you can type ""M, have my power company send me a copy of my last bill."" M may ask for some additional information, such as your address or account number, and then will place the call for you.

This will allow you to transfer money to and from your bank account., This will open the Payments screen., This is the only payment method supported by Messenger. You'll need a bank or credit union-issued debit card in order to send or receive money. Credit cards, pre-paid debit cards, and PayPal are not supported.

, Enter in the debit card number, expiration date, security code on the back, and ZIP code. Tap ""Save"" to add the card to your account.

Messenger does not support all banks, and your debit card may not yet be supported.

If there are multiple people in the conversation, you'll be prompted to select a person before proceeding.

, You can tap the ""Pay"" or ""Request"" tabs to switch between modes. Enter the amount you want to send someone or want to request from someone., You can clarify what you are sending or requesting money for. Use this if the other person may be unclear., Once you're satisfied, tap ""Next"" to send the payment request. The recipient will need to accept it (and have payments set up for their account), and then the money will start transferring. It can take three business days for the money to appear in your bank account., You can request rides from Uber and Lyft within your Messenger conversations. This can be great for letting a friend know you're on the way, or for ordering a ride for someone.

You'll need an Uber or Lyft account to use this feature, and will be guided through creating one if you don't have one yet.
You can also open a conversation directly with the Uber or Lyft chatbots. Start a new conversation with the Uber or Lyft bot and then proceed with these instructions.

, This will open the ride ordering menu., Currently you can select between Uber and Lyft (if they are available in your area). You'll still need an account with that service. You won't see this option if you started the process directly from a conversation with a bot

, This is required so that you can connect with the transportation service through the Messenger app., Depending on your location and the service you chose, you may have multiple ride options. Use the tabs to switch between them, and check with the transportation company's support site to see the difference between them., By default, it will be set to your current location. You can change this to anywhere, which is useful for ordering a ride for someone else., You'll need to enter the destination before you order the ride., The time it takes for your ride to appear will depend on local factors. Payment is handled through the payment information stored with the travel service, or through the debit card associated with your Messenger account., After ordering the ride, you'll receive a message from the ride service chat bot with the confirmation. You'll be able to find all of your ride receipts here, as well as chat with customer support if necessary.

, Messenger allows you to install a variety of apps designed to work in conjunction with the Messenger. You can do this from any conversation.

, You can scroll down through the list to see all of the apps that will work with Messenger. Some apps are standalone apps that integrate with Messenger, while others are designed specifically for it.


App availability varies depending on the device you are using.

, All apps for Messenger are installed through your device's app store.

, Tap ""Get"" or ""Install"" and install the add-on app like you would any other app on your device.

, It should have a blue dot on it, indicating new options are available.

, You'll find it in the list at the top of the screen. This will open the app on your device.

, Different apps will do different things, but most are related to creating content that you'll send through messenger. Refer to the app's support page for guides on getting the most out of it.

, You'll get a preview of what you're about to send before you send it.

, Chat-bots are a way for people to interact with companies and organizations without having to deal with phone calls or waiting for email responses. Chatbot support just started rolling out, and there are only a few available at the time of this writing. Below are a few of the available chatbots so far:CNN - m.me/cnn
Wall Street Journal - m.me/wsj
Poncho - m.me/hiponcho
1-800-flowers - m.me/1800flowers
Spring - m.me/springNYC

, This will display all of the contacts you have.

, If a chatbot is available to contact, you'll see it in the ""Bots"" list. The search feature is still a little unreliable, so you may find it easier to visit the chatbot's website (e.g. m.me/cnn) on your phone's mobile browser and choose to open the link in Messenger. This will open the conversation window directly., This is where things get interesting. Chatbots respond to specific commands and keywords, and don't work very well with natural language yet. Try to be as specific as possible, and just use a few words. Experiment with different approaches for different bots.


For example, you could say ""headlines"" to the CNN bot, and it would respond with the day's top headlines. You could type ""elections"" and get news primarily related to upcoming elections.
With 1-800-flowers, you can type ""order flowers"" to see what's available and place an online order. During the ordering process, you can type ""changed my mind"" to cancel., You can set how Messenger notifies you of new messages in the Settings. Tap the ""Settings"" button in the lower-right corner.

, This will open your notification settings for the Messenger app.


Note: You cannot completely disable notifications or change the sound settings from this menu. You'll need to disable Messenger notifications from the Settings app as explained in another step.

, This determines what information is shown in the alert banner when a message is received.

, Tap the ""Mute"" toggle to mute notifications for a set amount of time. You can choose from several intervals or the next morning (9 AM). You cannot completely disable notifications this way.

, Messenger has its own notification settings for when the app is open and active. In this menu, you can toggle sound and vibration on or off for messages received while the app is open.

, If you want to change how notifications appear, whether a sound is played, or you want to disable notifications completely, you'll need to use your iOS device's Settings app.

, This will display a list of apps.

, This will open the notification settings for the Messenger app.

, Turning this off will completely disable Messenger notifications.

, You can set whether or not notifications appear in the Notification Center, if a sound is played, if the app icon gets a number indicating unread messages, and whether messages appear on the lock screen. You can also set how notifications appear when you are using a different app on the device.

, You'll find the app settings in this section, including your notification options. Tap the ""Profile"" button in the upper-right corner.

, This will open the Messenger app's notification settings.


You cannot completely disable notifications for Messenger here. You'll need to use your Android's Settings app to turn off notifications as explained in another step.

, These previews show you the name and message contents for new messages received in the notification. Turn this off if you don't want this information appearing on your lock screen.

, You can turn the vibration for new notifications off using the slider.

, If you have an LED light on your device, you can toggle it on or off here. You may not have this option if your device doesn't have a light.

, Use the Sound slider to turn the Messenger notification sound on or off.

, You can select from any notification sounds you have loaded on your Android device.

, Messenger uses several different sounds in the app, such as when you refresh your conversation list. This slider will allow you to turn these sounds on or off.

, If you want to turn notifications for Messenger off completely, you'll need to do so from the Settings app on your Android:


Open Settings and tap ""Apps"" or ""Application manager.""
Tap ""Messenger"" in your list of applications.
Uncheck the ""Allow notifications"" box.
If you don't have this box here, return to the main Settings menu and select ""Sound & notification."" Tap the ""Apps"" option in the ""Notifications"" section. Select ""Messenger"" from the list of apps, then toggle ""Block"" on.

, Messenger can now be accessed from the Messenger.com website. You can use most of the features available in the mobile app, including payments.


There is no longer a dedicated Messenger computer program. Avoid downloading any program that claims to be able to connect to Facebook Messenger, as these put your account details at risk.

, If you're already logged into Facebook on your computer, you'll be able to proceed without entering your login details.

, You'll find a list of your conversations on the left side of the page. Selecting a conversation will open it in the main frame, and you'll find the image, sticker, GIF, recording, and payment options to the right of the message field.


Some features, such as ordering transportation, are not available on the web version.

Android - Open the Play Store and select ""My apps"" from the menu. Look for Messenger in the list of apps awaiting updates.
iOS - Open the App Store and tap the ""Updates"" tab. Update Messenger if it is on the list.;
, At the time of this writing, there are about a dozen bots available, with more being added every day. Chat bots are available for customer service, news, ordering, and more, depending on the company that releases it. For example, you could get news from the CNN bot and order flowers from the 1-800-flowers bot. The process for finding a bot varies depending on your device:iOS - Start a new message and search for the name of the bot you want to talk to. You'll see bots listed in the ""Bots and Businesses"" section of the search results. Look for the Messenger icon to see if they are a bot.
Android - Tap the ""+"" button in the Recents tab and select ""Search."" Search for the name of the bot you want to talk to. Bots will be listed at the bottom of the results in the ""Bots and Businesses"" section. Look for the Messenger icon on the profile picture, which indicates that its a bot.
You cannot currently search for a new chatbot to chat with on your Facebook site's Messages section, however you can search through existing conversations with chatbots from within your Facebook messages and re-start your chat at a later time.

, Besides searching for bots, you can scan Messenger Codes at businesses to add them to your contacts. This is the equivalent of visiting a m.me/user page. Only a few businesses are using these codes now, but expect more and more to start soon.You can scan in codes from the ""People"" tab. Tap the ""Scan Messenger Code"" option.

, Once you've found the bot you want to talk to, you can start a new conversation with it. The ""Get Started"" button appears when you select a bot and open the conversation window.

, You can use the Facebook desktop and mobile sites to connect to chat bots as well. You can use this to access the chat bot features without having to use the Messenger app/wesbite:


Open the Facebook page for the bot you want to connect with (e.g. facebook.com/cnn) in your desktop or mobile browser.
Click or tap the ""Message"" link in the ""About"" section of the page. If you don't see this link, the company does not have a bot available.
Click ""Get Started"". Note: if you don't see this at the bottom of the message window, the company/product is not using a bot and the messages you type in will simply go to their inbox
Start chatting with the bot. Click or tap the ""Get Started"" link in the chat to see some basic commands. You can find all of your previous conversations with bots in the Messages section of the Facebook site.

, Many bots will respond to a basic greeting with information on how to get started. This is not a universal feature, and some of the new chat bots do not respond to this. Still, it's a good way to try to get some quick information up front.

, Chat bots work by recognizing keywords and basic commands. Natural language doesn't work as well, so you'll get better results by sticking with keywords and phrases. The types of commands and phrases you can use depends on the type of bot you are chatting with.


Most bots are designed to fulfill a specific role. For example, the 1-800-flowers bot is designed to help order flowers and get help with an existing order.

, Some bots can handle being asked certain types of questions, but support for natural language is currently very limited. For example, you can ask Poncho what the current weather is in your location, but you may find it more difficult if you try to ask about the weather next week.


Expect chat bot functionality to increase and improve over time as more people use them and companies refine them. Chat bots don't explicitly learn from your interactions with them, but companies and Facebook will continue to make improvements so that they work naturally.

, Oftentimes a bot will respond with information accompanied with some links. Tapping these links can open websites or get more details.

, The language you can use with chat bots is limited. For example, with the CNN bot typing ""top headlines"" will not get a response, but typing ""headlines"" will get you the top stories of the day. If your inquiry is met with no response, try phrasing it in a different way., If you can't get a bot to do what you want it to, try looking for another one. more and more bots are being added all the time, so hopefully you'll be able to find bots that compete in the same space.

Discuss your options with M. After asking for a suggestion, M will likely provide you with several options or ask for further clarification.,
Ask M to make you a reservation.,
Make your payment (if necessary).,
Wait for confirmation.,
Tell M to add the reservation to your calendar.",How to Book Reservations with Facebook M," M can handle the entire reservation process for you through the Messenger app. If you're part of the M beta program, you can find M in your People list. You may also be able to find M in your Recent tab if you've used it recently.;
, M works best when you engage it in a natural conversation. Think of it like the concierge service at a hotel. Start by asking for suggestions based on what you want to do using natural English.For example, you could text, ""Hi M, could you suggest some top-rated Italian restaurants downtown that would be good for a romantic date?"" M may ask to clarify your location, and would then return a few suggestions on top-rated Italian restaurants nearby.
If you're looking for some entertainment for the evening, you can ask M about events going on downtown. Type something like, ""M, are there any plays happening in town tonight?"" M will respond with some of the popular plays that are going on tonight.
If you want to book a flight, type ""M, I'd like to book a flight to Destination from Departure Date to Return Date. What are the cheapest options for a direct flight?"" M may suggest alternate dates or multi-leg flights to save more money on travel., For example, M might text back that there are no highly rated Italian restaurants in your area. You can reply, ""Can you recommend any other fine dining?"" M will search again and list off a few recommendations.


Take this time to go back and forth with M until you find just what you want. Treat it like a conversation, and ask for more information if you need it. For example, M may tell you that the flight you want would be cheaper if you left on a different date. You could then text, ""What would the cost be if I left on the same day but came back a day earlier instead?"" M will find you a new price.

, Once you've settled on what you want to make a reservation for, you can ask M to place the reservation. M may ask you for some additional details in order to place the reservation for you.


To place a reservation at a restaurant, just let M know how many people you want to make a reservation for and when. For example, you could text, ""Book me a reservation for two people at 6:30 tonight"" and M will call the restaurant and attempt to make a reservation under your name.
To buy tickets to an event, tell M how many you'd like to buy and for what showing. You can text ""I'd like two tickets to Show Name tonight, in the Orchestra section if possible."" M will check for available seats and let you know if your request is possible. Payment will be handled using your Messenger payment method.
To book a flight, type ""OK, book that flight for me"" when M provides you with the flight you want to take. M may ask for additional information such as your birthday and frequent flyer number.

, If you're doing something like getting concert tickets or booking a flight, M will process the payment directly in the conversation. You'll need to have a credit or debit card added to your Facebook Messenger account, which M will prompt you to do if you haven't yet.


Tap the ""Pay"" button when prompted to agree to pay.

, The time it takes to process your request will vary depending on what you're doing. For example, it may take longer for M to book a flight than to make a reservation at a restaurant. Usually M works pretty quickly, but you may have to a wait a while in some cases. M will inform you when the reservation has been made., You can ask M to create an event on your calendar for the new reservation. By default, it will add it to your Facebook calendar, but you can also ask M to send you an event invite for your Google, Outlook, or iCloud calendar. For example, after the reservation has been made, you can text, ""M, send me an invitation to add this to my Google Calendar."" M will comply and you should receive an invite after a moment.

Don't poke someone to get other people's attention.,
Don't poke people you don't know well.",How to Poke a Friend on Facebook," Before you poke someone for the first time, it's nice to know exactly what you're doing. Poking a friend does the following:


Sends your friend a notification saying ""(Your name) poked you.""
Gives your friend the option to poke you back, dismiss the poke, or ignore it.
Records the poke on your friend's poke page.

Note: Each poke is only visible to whichever friend you poke. In other words, besides your friend, no one else can see the poke.;
, Poking a friend is easy. To start, just visit the profile of the person you'd like to poke. You can do this by entering their name into the search bar, visiting your Friends page, clicking their name in your news feed, etc.


You can only poke friends — you won't get the option to poke on the pages of people you aren't friends with.

, At the top of your friend's profile, you'll see a profile picture on the left, a cover photo stretching across the top, and a few buttons on the left side. Look for the one with an ellipses (three dots) on it. Click this button.

, This will send your friend a poke notification. Your friend can reply by poking you back or removing the poke.

, Facebook gives you a convenient way to view all of your pokes at once: the Pokes page. This is available at Facebook.com/pokes.Here, you can see who you've poked and who has poked you.


If you've been poking back and forth with a friend, this page will also show how many times in a row you've been poked.

, When someone pokes you (or you poke them and they poke you back), you will see a blue ""poke"" button next to their name on your Pokes page. Click this to automatically poke this person back. This is a convenient way to poke lots of people at once without having to visit their profiles., The appeal of poking is a little hard to explain to someone who doesn't already ""get it."" Poking someone on Facebook is a little like poking the person in real life — it's always a way of getting someone's attention, but it can also mean lots of different things. You can tease people with pokes, let them know you're thinking of them, or get them to message you — it all depends on the context of the situation.


Consider this: if two people who are attracted to each other poke each other late at night, does it mean the same thing as when two friends from school poke each other at noon, does it mean the same thing? Probably not., This is probably the most important rule when it comes to Facebook pokes. While it's fine to get into the occasional poke-fight with your friends, you won't want to make a habit of poking people incessantly. It's annoying to log on and see a new notification only to discover it's a poke, so if you do this too much your friends may start ignoring your pokes.

, Keep in mind that when you poke someone, only the recipient can see it. Don't use pokes to try to embarrass people — no one else will be able to see what you're doing.

, It's not at all uncommon to have Facebook ""friends"" that are distant acquaintances at best in the real world. While you can poke these people, it's not usually a good idea. It can be awkward to get pokes from people you aren't close to — it's a little like actually getting poked by someone you don't know well.

Avoid using logos or brands as your profile picture, as this may appear you are a spam page or trying to sell something to people who become friends with you.
Try not to use a picture of your pet or a group shot of you with others, as this could make it hard for someone to know who they are becoming friends with.Your cover image (the large image at the top of your Facebook profile) should also be approachable and personal. It could show a collage of other pictures of you or one bold image that conveys you as a whole.;
, When you fill in your About your page, just keep in mind all of your friends will be reading this information about you. So keep it personal without being so personal it turns anyone off or becomes too much information for the public forum of Facebook.Putting down your interests, your favorite movies, and your favorite books in your About page will give someone a better sense of what you enjoy and whether you would be a good fit as a friend, but keep in mind these are considered ""extras"" on your profile and are not required to set up a Facebook profile page.
Be aware that Facebook sells your information to marketing groups and third parties, who will then use the data to better market products to you. So be cautious of how much information you share about yourself on Facebook., If you are already using other platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr, you can link your Facebook account to your other accounts so when you post a photo or comment on any of these platforms, it appears on Facebook. This will allow you to share more with your friends and reach multiple audiences with one post.


Use this feature with caution, as you don’t want to become guilty of oversharing one post or clogging up your friends’ Facebook news feeds with your online activity.
If you are sharing a tweet from Twitter on your Facebook, try to remove all the hashtags used in the original tweet. Hashtags can look redundant and are unnecessary when they are posted on Facebook., While it may be tempting to share all your personal preferences, likes, and dislikes to attract new friends, keep in mind this information could also become public information for potential employers, ex spouses, and family members. Customize your Facebook privacy settingsso you can make sure your weekend warrior photos only appear on your friends' newsfeed, and be aware of exactly how much information you are giving out to others.Take advantage of the 4 basic privacy settings on Facebook and apply them to your profile, posts, tags, etc.:



Everyone: Grants access to anyone on the Internet.

Friends: Grants access to only your friends on Facebook.

Friends of Friends: Grants access to your friends on Facebook, as well as their friends.

Custom: Grants access to a select audience of your choice, including specific people and networks.
Use the audience selector tool option, which allows you to decide how public or how private you want a certain status you just posted or a photo of you added by a friend or by you, to be.You can also set privacy settings for future posts or tags by you and of you by others. Doing this will ensure you know exactly what you are sharing with your friends and what will remain private. This way, you can keep your profile friendly, and still have control over how much you want your new friends to know about you.

, Look up the names of friends from school, work, or your weekly reading group to see if they are on Facebook and send them a friend request.


Start with individuals you know directly via your other social groups, as well as relatives or family friends that may be on Facebook.

, This is a quick and easy way to start a friend base, especially if you are new to Facebook. All you need to do is upload your contacts to Facebook and Facebook will then add them automatically to your friend list.


To do this, you will need a .csv file of all your contacts. If you are using Microsoft Outlook, simply export your contacts, and if you are using Gmail or Hotmail, go to contacts and look for export in the settings menu.
Be sure to screen your email contacts before you upload them to Facebook, as sometimes work contacts or old contacts can get mixed in. You want to avoid adding individuals who are purely work related to your personal Facebook page. As well, its best to avoid adding individuals you do not talk to anymore or interact with as they will likely be a non presence on your Facebook page or not accept your friend request.

, Once you begin to add individuals you know from social groups like school work, or recreational gatherings, Facebook will start to post profiles of people you may know through your existing friends.


Facebook will also show you how many mutual friends in common you have with this potential friend so you can trace how you know this person and are assured it is not a complete stranger.

, Maybe you want to support a political cause, or are looking to network with people who are also avid fans of a television show you love. Use the search bar to check if a group for your interest exists on Facebook and join the group.


By joining online groups full of like minded individuals or those who also share your interests, you will be posting and sharing with a potentially large pool of individuals who could also become Facebook friends with you.
If you see a post on a group you are part of that you find interesting, reply to it and start a dialogue with the person who posted the comment or link. This dialogue could then develop into a friend request.

, It’s always a good idea to identify your relationship with the person or introduce yourself, as they will more likely accept your request if they can place you among the people they know or are reminded how they know you.


For example, if you’re sending a friend request to someone in the same online West African Music Appreciation group as you, add a friendly note to the request clarifying how you know each other and that you thought it would be great if you could be friends.
As well, if you are friending a friend of a friend, add a note about your mutual friend in common.

, By making your presence known on the walls of your friends, this will also cause your posts or comments to show up on your friends’ newsfeeds, which will then show up on their friends’ newsfeeds, thereby contributing to the never ending friends cycle on Facebook.


Sharing and commenting on the walls of your friends will not only lead to more friend requests, it will also give your new friends a sense of who you are online and what you like to talk about or share with others.

, Don’t be afraid to show your wackier side on Facebook. After all, the idea is to let people get to know you better and an easy way to do this is to express your thoughts and emotions in an honest way.In fact, posts about personal journeys, stories, or just a funny thing that happened to you that day tend to get some of the highest likes and comments.
Of course, keep in mind the too much information rule and try to share things you would want to tell a casual friend or the general public. Don’t overstep the comfort level of others, and if you do decide to TMI, be prepared to lose some Facebook friends!

, Just like in real life, making friends on Facebook is a two-way street. So don’t cultivate a news feed or a profile wall that is just about you. Pose a question to your friends in your status or ask your friends to share what they think or how they feel in a comment.When in doubt, ask a yes or no question to start a conversation and then respond promptly to keep the conversation with your friends going.

, Keep in mind that on Facebook, its about quality, not quantity. So keep your posts interesting by telling people when you’re having a bad day, wishing friends a happy birthday, and posting funny videos or images of your favorite internet cat.


By keeping your Facebook presence interesting and full of different posts or shares, you will keep your friends engaged in what you have to say.

, Maybe you have your own clothing line or sell cat bowties on the side, but your friends on your personal Facebook page don’t necessary want to hear your latest business pitch. Save the business promos for your business page and don’t let it take over your personal page.


Always keep your audience in mind before you post anything on Facebook. If the information seems better suited for your Facebook business page or as a private message to someone who has expressed interest in your business, put it where it belongs and don’t let it clutter your friends’ news feed.

, Constant, 24/7 status updates and posts can become annoying and will likely lead to a de-friending or a rejected friend request.


Try to post two to three things a day, at different times of day, to reach the most friends and not seem like you are trying to clog up their news feeds.

You'll find friends of friends, or maybe friends of friends of friends, and have something in common with everyone. You'll be more likely to come up under the ""People You May Know"" section and may even have a few friend requests come to you.


When you do join a network, be active in it! Post on the wall, ask people questions, like their comments, do some commenting of your own, and make your presence known. Plenty of people want more friends on Facebook; you'll be a clear person to ask.;
, If all of us only friended the people we actually know and know well, our Facebook accounts would be sorely lacking. To gain access to people you don't know but would like to be friends with, join groups! Those with similar interests, of course.


Do a few quick searches for the things you like or the things you're a fan of. This way you can post on the group page and get into conversations with other members. This creates the base of your next round of friendships.

, If you sat at home waiting for that cute boy or girl to ask you out on Friday night, it wouldn't happen. The same goes for Facebook: people won't always be coming to you – you have to go to them sometimes, too. When you find someone you want to be friends with, ask them! What's the worst they can do? Not accept? Not a biggie.


You may want to be at least a little discerning with this. If you go about friending every person within a 500-mile radius, you may wind up getting blocked. Stick to people that are reasonable to friend and then you can branch out from there.

, Let's say you're throwing a wild party at your house next weekend. Make a Facebook invitation page and keep it open! Let friends invite friends. As soon as those friends see the page and decide they want to come to the party, they'll likely friend you. Or they'll see how popular you are and want a piece of the action!


You can do the same with fan pages or your own personal business, too. The more popular they are and if you're clearly associated with them, the more people may come a-knockin' on your door.

, Most people see a friend request from someone they don't know and assume they're just some creeper that just wants more friends. Don't be that creeper! Instead, include a message with your friend request.


Let's say you're friending someone who's in your ""I Love Bubble Tea"" group. Along with your friend request, say something like, ""Hey Tina! I see that you're in the ""I Love Bubble Tea"" group, too! What's your favorite tea place in the area?""

, It's a little contrived, but people respond to it. If you're friending them and all they see is your name and a picture of you with Angelina Jolie, you're way more likely to get accepted. You could be the next big thing (they don't have to know), so they can't turn you down!


There are some types of people that this won't work on. Others will be like putty in your hands. Especially if your photos are public and you have a few with captions like, ""Chillin' with Lina Jo getting our French fry on at the Grove."" The ones anxious for some credos will eat it up.

, If, on that same picture, you have, ""Chiln wit lina joe getin r french fry on @ da grove,"" people are less likely to be inspired. Resist the urge to use textspeak over Facebook; it just makes you look dumb. This goes double for friend request messages!


If your profile is public, this goes for your entire page. Most people will scope you out before they friend you. You want them to see a page that's interesting and polished – not one that your little brother or sister threw together.

, Apart from your profile picture (which should also be interesting), it's useful to have good pictures at the top of your lineup. When people go to find out just who the heck you are, they might go through a handful of your pictures. If they're funny, eye-catching, or somehow remarkable, they'll be more inclined to say yes.


Try not to be too repetitive; too many people get obsessed with the vacation they're on and post dozens of photos of the same mountain. Keep your photos of different, notable things. And that doesn't mean your empty dinner plate!

, There are tons of things people do that are just huge turn-offs to their friends. Here's how to post the ""right' kind of post:


Ask compelling questions. If you just want a handful of likes, ask people for their thoughts. ""Hey guys, what's the best movie to curl up to when you're sick and feeling terrible?"" or ""Kittens or Puppies? GO.""
Keep them appropriate and inoffensive. Posting, ""Man, women are the worst. Why don't they just stay in the kitchen where they belong?"" will not do you any favors.
Make sure they're not all the same. If your entire wall is dedicated to ""The Bachelor"" or some other idea (regardless of how popular it is), you're likely to get hidden constantly. No one will comment and you'll be left with empty posts that don't look good to potential friends!
Make sure they're not embarrassing. ""Just cried for hours over my boyfriend dumping me...AGAIN,"" isn't something the Facebook world has to know. Don't use it as a platform for airing out your dirty laundry. You won't feel better and you won't be more popular.

, When people look at your profile, whether they're your friends yet or not, you want them to see someone who looks like they have a life. Posting ""Just drank a Coke!"" and ""Just went to the bathroom!"" every five minutes will surely make people second-guess whether or not they want to be your friend. Keep your posts to a few a day, tops.


If your wall is just post after post of you updating everyone on the trivialities of your life, people can hear the groans of their future newsfeed from miles away. They'll know that being your friend will just bombard them with useless information consistently. So pace it!

, Facebook is busiest at night and on the weekend. If you want to look more popular, post at these times. 6-9 PM is a great time after work (people are just dying to see more pictures of cute cats after a hard day at the office), and weekends (morning, especially), people are lazing around killing time on the Internet.The more buzz your posts get, the more Facebook bumps them up in your friends' feeds. And if loads of people are commenting on your stuff, it may even get into feeds of your friends of friends. Time it right and you'll be even more popular.

, Newsflash: people don't read. At least, they try pretty hard to avoid it. If you want people to go gaga over your Facebook page, think in pictures. Short, quippy captions and intriguing pictures will make your page buzz with activity.


The same general principles apply for pictures, however. You don't want to post too much, you want to post the right pictures (read: interesting ones), and you want to post at the right times. Pictures can get just as boring as type can.

, If someone looks at your page and sees that it's dedicated to rants and gossip, they'll either never friend you or de-friend you straightaway. No one wants that stuff in their feed! Stick to things you find funny or interesting and you'll be good to go.


If you do feel that urge to get a little negative and you just have to tell everyone about it, frame it appropriately. Instead of saying, ""No one go to Pizza Hut ever again! They're all criminals who will steal your money!"" go for, ""Guy at Pizza Hut triple charged me. Who wants to go to Pizza Hut, walk in with Domino's in hand, and make inappropriate amounts of eye contact?""

Consider what your friend is doing that bothers you so much.,
Wait to see your friend in person.,

Take further measures if the behavior does not actually stop.,
Unfriend or even block the person.",How to Confront an Annoying Facebook Friend," Does he or she share ever detail of his or her life, no matter how mundane? Does he or she pressure you to like every single post that he or she makes? Take time to think about why your friend bothers you so much before proceeding.;
, It's inadvisable to confront your friend online about issues like these, because misunderstandings could happen online. Instead, it's best to wait until you can see your friend face-to-face. If need be, you could call your friend, or send an email explaining that you want to talk, but do not give any details other than that.

, Be polite yet direct. You could say: ""I've enjoyed being your friend on Facebook, but I would also appreciate it if you could please stop (whatever is bothering you). (Explain why that behavior is bothering you)"". For instance, if your friend is pressuring you to like every single post that he or she makes, you could say ""I've enjoyed being your friend on Facebook, but I would also appreciate it if you could please stop pressuring me to like every single post that you make. I have liked several of your posts, but I have other friends on Facebook and their posts appear on my news feed, too, and I don't have time to check for your posts all day"".

, If the behavior continues, you could ask to see your friend again in person. This time, be a little more direct with him or her, but remain polite as usual. For example, you could say: ""The last time we talked, I asked you to stop (doing whatever what is bothering you). I'm not sure why you ignored my request, but please heed it from here on forth"".

, If the behavior continues even more, that would be an appropriate time to unfriend the Facebook friend.

Post your request.",How to Ask for Recommendations on Facebook," The best way to engage your Facebook friends, and Facebook’s recommendations feature, is to word your post as a question. Like any good question, it should be kept short and sweet. Instead of statement like “I’m in New York for the weekend, and I think I want to get a burger” use a question like “Where can I get a good burger in New York?”
, Facebook’s recommendations features has an algorithm designed to recognize status updates asking for recommendations from their friends. While an exact list of words that are recognized isn’t available, using the word “recommendations” in your post is sure to trigger the feature.

Don’t be afraid to experiment with the wording of your post; if it doesn’t work, you can always edit it and add “recommendations.”, Whether it’s a city or a specific neighborhood, you need to mention the area you’ll be in. Not only will this ensure your friends give you appropriate recommendations, it also allows Facebook’s recommendations feature to pull up the exact locations of businesses or services your friends suggest., Make sure to include the type of service you’re looking for in your request. For example, if you’re looking for a mechanic, you may want to specify the type of work you need done, such as an oil change or bodywork. It might be a good idea to include your budget as well, especially when dealing with restaurant recommendations. This will ensure the recommendations are appropriate for your needs.

Here’s an example of a well-worded request: “Hi guys! Anyone know of a good place for sushi in downtown Seattle? Looking for no more than $50 for two people! Thanks!”

, You’ll find it in the same place whether you’re on your newsfeed (essentially your “home page”) or your profile page. To quickly reach your newsfeed, you can click on the Facebook logo at the top left corner of the screen., After clicking on the status box, the text option should be selected by default. Write your request for a recommendation here., After writing your status asking for recommendations, click on the blue “Post” button at the bottom right corner of the status update box. This will post the request to your wall., It should state the specific location mentioned in your post (such as a city, state or country) in place of the “___”. Clicking this will add a small map of this location to your status update, and allow for your friends’ suggestions to be mapped on it., Whatever page of Facebook you find yourself on, you can find the search bar at the top of the screen, right next to the Facebook logo. Enter your query here, whether it’s related to a type of food, a particular interest, hobby or service. Then press enter to launch the search.

For instance, if you’re looking for a good mechanic in the Los Angeles area, you’ll likely want to search for “Los Angeles Mechanics.” Pay attention to the group’s name, as this will tell you if it’s appropriate for your needs.

, Once you’ve found a group you think will help you find what you need, you should join it. This can be done from the group’s page by clicking on the “Join Group” button.

Be aware that, depending on the nature of your request, you might not find a group relevant enough to truly help you. This is especially true if you live in a more rural area.
Some groups are private, and an administrator will need to approve your request to join them. The time this takes will vary from group to group; it can take a few hours or a few days., Near the top of the group page, you should find a box inviting you to post something. It’ll look much like the box you’ll find on your profile or your newsfeed. Write your request for recommendations here.

Since you’ll likely have joined a group that matches your location and the service you’re looking for, you might not need to be as specific in your request as in other methods.
Note that many Facebook groups have rules concerning what you can and can’t post. Be sure to review these carefully before making your request, or you might get banned from the group. They’re usually found in “pinned” posts, at the top of the group page, or in the group’s description."

Keep up with all Facebook changes and news.,
Be the conduit of fresh, novel, and eventful news and information in an area you're known for and that your friends expect to come from you.,
Provide commentary.,
Add photos of yourself and other people actively pursuing the trend, fad, or issue that you'd like to turn viral.,
Seek to motivate and educate others.,
Be responsive and actively engaged with your friends.,
Seek to link up with other influencers and celebrities across Facebook.",How to Be a Facebook Tastemaker Among Your Friends," Being the primary source of what's happening with or changing on Facebook itself is an assured way of getting yourself noticed. Relay information about privacy changes, interface changes, Facebook usage and skills news, etc., all before your friends do. They'll come to expect you to be the source of this knowledge and look to you for it, and will most likely share it widely on your behalf, garnering you more kudos in the process.;
, This will help you to get more and more likes from the people who matter – your friends, but most of all, your friends with like interests. But most of all, it proves to your friends that you are always on the pulse, at the coalface, and ready for action!

, Don't just slap in links and photos - alone these won't do a thing but sit there. As well as ensuring that your information is recent and fresh, it's important that you provide analysis along with your information. This isn't about being long-winded though; practice providing insightful, concise, and pointed comments to engage your friends in discussion and thought. Be sure to bring your expertise to bear by incorporating thought-provoking questions, conclusions, and statements to round off each analysis.

, Whether it's something you do, look at, wear, send, eat, whatever, be sure to find a way to include a visual representation of it with you at the center!

, This is a large part of the role of a tastemaker or influencer. If you want to influence others to be involved in your causes and trends, you'll have a dual role of motivating and educating. Ask yourself:


What is the message I aim to get across with this particular trend today? Can it be summarized neatly or is to too disparate? If the latter, how can I find a way to make it have more impact in smaller chunks?
What will I be passing on to my friends that they don't already know? Am I adding shades of depth that they're not aware of in an area they're familiar with? What value am I adding?
How can I get my friends to actively do something and not just respond virtually? What methods can I use to motivate them (prizes, videos, reward or tally boards, etc.), and how can I track what others are doing actively (ask them to show photos/videos, send in stories, etc.)?

, Respond to all comments made in a timely fashion so that your friends know you're there and you're listening.


Try to analyze your outreach and impact. At this stage, the tools available to accurately gauge your impact are disparate and you need to compile impact by drawing things together. You can use analytical tools, web engagement tools, Facebook statistics, and see whether you're gaining more friends; as well as getting feedback about the viral nature and quality of what you've shared. Deeper knowledge of how other influencers within Facebook are dealing with your information will not be as apparent but do what you can to draw together the feedback and analytics and learn from these to improve each time.

, This will give you more standing with your friends and gives you access to a world of advice, support, and examples that you might not otherwise be privy to. Linking up will require careful approaches, being tenacious and offering something that is worth the other influencer supporting you as part of their Facebook campaigns too. Do your homework and be well respected before seeking to link up.

Make a pre-emotive move to keep the awkward friend requests from even reaching you.,
Feign ignorance.,
Alternatively, be upfront.,
Delay the acceptance and reflect.,
Review your privacy settings.,
Bar future requests.,
Enjoy being discerning about your friendships on Facebook.",How to Handle Awkward Friend Requests on Facebook," Block someone who freaks you out by searching his or her name and clicking on ""Report/block this person"". That way, should they ever wish to waste their time trying to friend you on Facebook, it's never going to happen. The sorts to look for? Old school enemies, that bloke who keeps ogling you at the watercooler and anyone from your extended family that ran away with all the cash.


If you're concerned about complete strangers sending you friend requests, go to your privacy settings and click ""Edit Settings"" for ""How You Connect"". For ""Who can send you friend requests?"" select ""Friends of Friends"".;
, If you decline a request, Facebook won't send out screaming notifications the person has been denied. The two of you will just not be connected on Facebook is all. Therefore, it is not too far of a stretch to say that you never got the friend request, if confronted about it. What you will want to do is block the person as soon as you receive their request. If they ask you about it, say that you are no longer using Facebook. Since you have blocked them, they will no longer see any more activity of yours on Facebook, so your story will be more believable. If, however, they are savvy enough to search for you using another account which you haven't blocked (or even simply while logged out), you might be in trouble.

, If declining a friend request from your boss, for example, keep it short and polite. Something like ""Hi, I received your friend request. I'd like to keep my personal and professional lives separated. Thank you for understanding!"" should do it, plus showing a huge dollop of professional initiative on your behalf. You could also offer to add them on LinkedIn instead.

, If you have just met someone while networking or pub-crawling and they are slobbering all over you with a Facebook friend request before you've even gotten back home and put your PJs on, click on ""Not Now"". This will hide the request until later; giving you time to decide whether this new acquaintance is someone you want to add to your Facebook crowd.

, Just because you have declined a friend request does not mean they cannot see what you are doing on Facebook. Use those privacy controls to limit the amount seen in your profile by non-friends. Go through each item and make everything ""friends only"".


Use the ""Limited Profile"" Friend list to restrict what certain people can see. Under the Account -> Edit Friends, go to ""Create a List"". Add people to new lists according to what you classify them as (for example, best friends, My Flirts, Acquaintances, Parental, etc.). Then apply privacy settings as a whole to that list and be worry free.

, When you deny a friend request on Facebook, you'll be sent a prompt asking you if you know this person outside Facebook itself. If you select ""Yes"", Facebook will let the person try to add you again (clearly once they've realized that you're not responsive) but if you select ""No"", they'll be barred from sending you any further requests.

, It's one thing to have the village following your updates and quite another to have the whole city knowing your movements. Accept the people who count in your life and break loose from the rest.

Evaluate the possibilities.",How to Get over Being Unfriended on Facebook2," If you have determined that you were unfriended by someone, come up with plausible reasons why they might have unfriended you. Be reasonable and honest as you make this assessment––no need for beating yourself up or for pretending you're not doing annoying things! The following are some helpful questions to consider when determining why you might have been unfriended:



Were you being spammy?: One of the most annoying things for Facebook readers is to read spam several times a day. Perhaps you've been over-promoting your business (personal or commercial) or perhaps you're just going on a little too much about a product or service you think rocks.

Are you showing off?: Another thing high up on the list of Facebook irritants is people who make too much of themselves. Do you constantly post ""selfies"" on your wall? Are you spending a lot of time mentioning where you're vacationing or how much of an entertaining weekend you're experiencing? Do you keep telling people how far you've cycled, how many calories you're not consuming or how low your BMI is?

Are you updating your game successes too often?: People not playing the same games as you easily tire of the ""My farm army has expanded 99 times!"" messages, along with the ""won't you join me too?"" requests. Eventually, this wears thin and you can lose Facebook friends over it.

Are you trolling for praise?: Asking people to constantly ""like"" the things you do or say can send some of your wall readers to despair. If people can't be left alone to decide for themselves, they may resort to unfriending instead.

Do you give a lot of space to PDAs?: Too much by way of public displays of affection for your beloved/spouse/fiancé/BFF/pet/whatever can be exhausting to a reader, especially if he or she lacks a little love.

Do your baby/child exploits dominate your updates?: Occasional cute shots of your kids are one thing; too much information about toilet training and genius potential send some readers to the unfriend button.

Are the two of you having a disagreement?: Did the two of you get in some kind of fight, either on Facebook or in real life? Disagreement can easily shift into a rather passive-aggressive unfriending option on behalf of one party to the disagreement. It may seem petty but if it gets you hot under the collar, the message has been truly delivered. Perhaps it's time to extend the olive branch.

Is this person over-extended?: Does the person have close to the limit of 5,000 friends? In which case, unless you're a close buddy, this may simply be a pragmatic decision to bump you off to make space for someone who lives next door and is a bit more familiar than you.

Are you a complainer?: Is every status a health update of your every ache, pain, surgery, recovery and upcoming doctors appointments? Whether you are trying to get attention, empathy or ""I'm praying for you"" comments, you can come off as a constant complainer. When was the last time you wanted to be friends with someone like that?

Do you ""over share""?: How many memes, pictures with sarcastic, cute, funny, inspirational sayings did you ""share"" in the last week? Sure, these can be fun, but if you're filling up people's walls with these and you can't come up with original status on your own, maybe you're just not very interesting to ""friends"".

Are your political and religious views overtly obviously?: Constantly posting about the political parties you like or don't like can be quite irritating to others. Especially annoying are the guilt memes; ""Share if you're not ashamed to love God/Jesus"".

Stalking.: If you comment on every post a your friend makes, they may think you are a Facebook Stalker. Imagine the real-world equivalent of someone commenting on your every move. There's a fine line between friendship and creepiness.

Game invites.: If you were sending too many game invites to your friend, this can become annoying and likely cause people to unfriend you.

Is this person really a friend?: Do you know this person very well? In the case of the friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend, things get a bit tenuous and your updates just may be too irrelevant or unfamiliar for the barely-known friend on Facebook.

Understand and accept.,
Move on.,
Forget Facebook.,
Add someone new.",How to Get over Being Unfriended on Facebook3," While you might not be one hundred percent certain of the reason for being unfriended, based on your reasonable assessment of the reason, seek to understand it. For example, if the person had nearly 5,000 friends, it's reasonable for them to remove what they perceived as a more random person from their friend list in order to make room for more friends or family. You'd most likely do the same and should allow others that leeway too. In reaching acceptance, the following will help you:


Do not be upset or angry with the person. Instead, respect their decision to unfriend you. After all, if you unfriended someone, you wouldn't want them to despise you for it!
Realize that you cannot make people stay friends with you, either on Facebook or in real life. It just isn't realistic and fluidity of relationships is part and parcel of what life is.
Avoid reading more meaning into the unfriending act than was intended. Even if you think that the unfriending was a deeply cutting action, you owe it to yourself to realize that validation of your self worth comes from within you, not from external sources. Avoid lingering over any alleged hidden message!
If you know that this is a direct result of an argument, seek to mend the broken bridge between you. This is no different than if you had received any other indicator that the person was upset or annoyed with you. However, don't make a big deal about the unfriending itself––seek to resolve the disagreement, not the unfriending.
If the person who unfriended you was a close friend or relative, try gently confronting them about why they unfriended you. Perhaps it was an accident! Even if it wasn't, be friendly about asking them, never rude or accusatory.
Outside of a disagreement, if this is a person who you see regularly outside of Facebook, continue to be respectful and friendly toward them. Never be rude or interrogate them about their decision to unfriend you. If you do wish to raise it, be friendly and understanding.

, Don't linger on the fact that you've been unfriended, and don't try to change your Facebook profile in order to please others. If you're happy with what you say and post, don't change anything. Realize that it is your friend's loss if they don't get to have a glimpse into your life through Facebook. Refrain from dwelling on the fact that you've been unfriended, and never stalk their page to see what they're up to. Move on; you have tons of others friends who still enjoy your company.


Change any annoying behavior you've been indulging in. While you shouldn't change the way you are or what you're happy with about your approach to Facebook, do change annoying behaviors (as noted in the previous section). Spamming, too many updates, adding irrelevancies or boring people senseless aren't good approaches to using Facebook. Notice what you could do better, and make the change so that you can enjoy using Facebook without feeling like it's a source of negativity in your life.

, If you find yourself unable to forget about the person who unfriended you and it's causing to become obsessive (you're ruminating about it too much), it may be time to take a break from Facebook for a while. After all, it is one of the most addicting habits of this generation. Some suggestions for coping till your annoyance blows over include:


Deactivate your account or leave it right where it is, untouched for awhile.
Remove the app from your phone. You will want the app out of sight, out of mind, especially on a portable device that's accessible from anywhere! Give yourself a much needed break to get back some perspective.
Do other activities you enjoy, such as sports, the outdoors, art, music, or even write an article on wikiHow. Distracting yourself from the annoyance will soon put it back in its place––in the pile of petty nothings.


Don't focus on one little act that someone did and most likely never thought of again. Focus on living life, rather than seeing it reflected back at you on Facebook.







, If you feel like it will help, add someone new to your friend list. Maybe it is someone you've only spoken to once or twice at school or work, or maybe it's the new girl on the volleyball team. If you try to make friends with someone new, this will help you forget about the person who unfriended you."

Choose your action.,
Understand how online poker differs from live poker.,
Decide to buy again if you lose.,
Leave the table when you're done.,
Get more chips.",How to Play Zynga Poker4," Zynga Poker follows standard no-limit Texas Hold'Em rules. Each player is dealt two cards face down, and the goal is to make the best five-card hand using the community cards that are dealt in the center of the table.


Betting occurs after the first two cards are dealt, after the first three community cards are shown, after the fourth card is shown, and after the fifth card is shown.
Each player takes turns as the dealer, with betting occurring to the dealer's left.
The first two players to the dealer's left must bet automatically to start the round, called ""blinds"".
For detailed instructions on how to play Texas Hold'Em, see this guide.

, When you choose a table, you ""sit down"" at an empty seat. If there is a hand in progress, you will need to wait until the next hand is dealt in order to play. When you sit at a table, you will see your opponents and the amount of chips that they have.

, As play continues around the table, you will see each player's bet for the round in front of them. When action reaches you, you can decide to Call (match any bets), Check (pass if there are no bets to match), Bet/Raise (increase the bet), or Fold (discard your cards and withdraw from the hand).


You can set your action before play reaches you if you know what you want to do beforehand. If the action is no longer viable when play reaches you (for example, you set to Check but someone Raises), you can change it.
Each player has a time limit to perform an action. The time limit is represented by a yellow bar around the active player's picture that depletes as the time limit counts down.
If you are playing on mobile, you will need to use the bet slider to increase or decrease your bet.

, There are some major differences when playing online, mainly stemming from the fact that no one is playing with real money. This will lead to a lot of raises that you probably wouldn't see at an actual poker.


It can be very difficult to bluff in online poker, as you can't see anyone's faces or physical reactions. Opponents are much more likely to call raises in online poker as well, since the money isn't real.

, If you run out of chips from your initial buy-in, you can choose to ""rebuy"", which will give you more chips and allow you to keep playing. You must have chips available in your bank in order to rebuy.

, If you don't want to keep playing, click the ""Stand Up"" button in the upper-left corner. You will leave your seat, though you can continue to watch the table. If you want to return to the lobby, click the ""To Lobby"" button.


You cannot leave the table when you have an active hand.

, While the main way to get chips is to win them from other players, there are a variety of way that you can earn more chips. On the left side of the lobby screen, you can participate in a slot machine that can award you chips if you win. You get a free pull after a certain amount of time has passed, but you can pull whenever you'd like if you pay with Casino Gold. Casino Gold costs real money.


You can also purchase more chips directly from Zynga by clicking on your chip total in the corner of the lobby screen. You can choose which package you'd like to purchase with real money.
You can win a small amount of chips and test your poker knowledge by clicking the Poker Genius button. This is located in the upper-right corner of the screen , in the Dice menu. Poker Genius will quiz you on which hands are most likely to win, and correct answers are awarded a small amount of chips. Poker Genius is only available for a few rounds per day.

The 2-player game also offers you the option of playing a random opponent. If you select this option, your opponent will be chosen randomly from all Facebook users with the Scrabble app.

, If one of the tiles you're playing is a blank tile, the game will prompt you to indicate which letter you're using it to represent and mark that letter on the tile in red so that all players know your intent.

, At this point, your score updates and play passes to the next player. The game will notify you when it's your turn again.


Players have as much time as they need to make their moves, so a Facebook Scrabble game may take several hours or even several days. You can play more than 1 game at a time, if you wish.
As soon as you've played a word, your rack is refreshed with new letters to bring it back to 7 tiles. The bag icon displays the number of tiles remaining in the game, not counting yours and your opponents'. Once the bag is empty, the game reports the number of tiles a player who has fewer than 7 has remaining.

, As with the Scrabble board game, the values of unplayed letters are subtracted from the scores of the players who have them. Highest score wins. You then have the option to share your results on your timeline.

Be kind.",How to Chat with a Girl on Facebook," Messenger sends private messages between you and the girl you’re trying to chat with. Your messages won’t be subject to the comments and likes of other people, but it will feel a little more personal. If you’re unsure how to begin, open the conversation by asking about something perfunctory rather than personal. This doesn’t mean that a personal conversation can’t follow, but it puts less pressure on getting the conversation started.


You could say, “Hey, do you know what the English homework is for tomorrow? I forgot to write it down,” or “What time does our shift at the restaurant begin tomorrow, again?”;
, Conversation starters are open-ended questions that allow you to get to know someone better. These don’t have to be particularly loaded or customized. They are just to break the ice. If you’ve been writing on each other’s Facebook wall posts already, you could even follow up on something she’s posted about.


For a basic conversation starter, you could say, “So, what are you up to this weekend?” or “Read any good books lately?”
If she posted on her wall that she saw the new Star Wars movie, for example, you could say, “I’ve been meaning to see the new Star Wars. How did you like it?” This opens an opportunity for you to get to know each other better.

, It’s likely you and the girl you’d like to chat with know each other through something you both already do. Try talking about joint activities like classes or work you already have in common. Drawing on shared experiences will bring you closer.You could say, “I really liked that drill we did at practice today. You ran so fast!” or “That customer at the store today was hilarious. Did she really think we made cupcakes at a hot dog place?”

, Chances are you want to talk to this girl on Facebook because there’s something you like about her. Talk about your mutual interests to connect with her on a deeper level.You could say, “I saw you’re wearing a Ramones T-shirt in your profile photo. I love them too. What’s your favorite album?”

, Most people enjoy talking about themselves, and everyone appreciates a good listener. Ask the girl questions to get to know her better.


You could say, “What’s your favorite food?” or “Do you like the outdoors?”
Many people list their interests in their Facebook profiles. Do a little research on what she likes before talking to her.
Avoid asking anything excessively personal, which may make her uncomfortable. Religion, sex, politics and money are some sensitive topics it’s best to avoid when getting to know someone.

, In the beginning, it may make sense to keep Messenger conversations shorter rather than longer. A conversation that goes on and on may feel uncomfortable to her if you don’t know each other well. Get to know one another gradually over multiple messages to build friendship in a natural way.

, If the girl you’re chatting with blocks you or asks you not to contact her anymore, respect her wishes. She may not be interested in the type of relationship you’re seeking right now.

, If you don’t know the girl very well, it makes sense to first interact with her publicly on her wall. This type of interaction a bit more casual, but whatever you say or share may be subject to the comments and likes of others, so keep that in mind. To get a conversation going, try making a good-natured joke about something she’s posted. This shows that you are engaged with what she’s interested in and that you have a sense of humor.Keep your jokes clean and don’t try to tear down any other comments with yours.
If she likes or comments positively on your post, that is a good sign. You could try progressing to a private message, if she’s receptive to your wall posts.

, Photos are a good way to reinforce a connection with someone you like. If you have photos together from a day at work or school trip, you could post them and tag her. You could also share a funny photo that is not of the two of you but appropriate to a post she makes, such as a meme, to make her laugh.If you have photos together, even in a group, you could share one and say, “Remembering this awesome day today!”

, If you and the girl you’re trying to chat with have any inside jokes, post one on her wall. Inside jokes are good because they don’t tire out quite as easily as other jokes. Posting one (even if it was created in a larger group) will make her smile and cement a bond between you.

, In all your Facebook wall interactions, strive to be kind. It can be hard to read sarcasm online. If your tone is difficult to discern, she may interpret your posts as critical, even if that’s not how you mean them.Phrases to avoid might include, “I’m not rude; I just say what everyone else is thinking.”

Ponder over the fact that the ideal human tribe number is thought to be about 150.This anthropological and sociological figure was reached through studying people's interactions in societies and it is also thought to apply to the online context.After all, there is only so much buzz and chatter that you can actually manage to take in without feeling overloaded.,
Think about the benefits of reducing the numbers of friends in your Facebook environment.,
Value your time.,
Reflect on what ""friend"" means to you.,
Consider all the other things you'd rather be doing than pretending to like someone else's Facebook updates, photos, ideas, whatever.,
Cull your so-called Facebook friends by being discerning.,
Set aside an afternoon to go through your friends list the first time.,
Decline friend requests like there is no tomorrow.",How to Be Discerning With Your Facebook Friends," As such, if your Facebook friends amount to more than 150, it may just be that your online tribe capacity is bulging at the seams and that there are people there whom you rarely, if ever, interact with.;
, Fewer friends means more time for those you do actively engage with. It means times for more fruitful and enjoyable interactions that don't consist of attention-seeking updates and boring, inane daily details. There is also less room for misunderstandings and inflammatory situations because your friends know what you mean and don't take things you've said online the wrong way, as might people who really don't know or care for the real you.


Another benefit is fewer people snooping on you. Not that you've anything to hide but what about all those stories of stolen identities, revealing photos being passed along to potential employers, and cheating relationships being unearthed?(This is not to mention those friends who think they're doing you a good turn by sharing a photo of you as a teen in a very compromising position...) All of this is grist for reflection about how so-called friends can be motivated to use the information they glean from Facebook. If you know who your real friends are on Facebook, you can loosen up a little and misbehave a bit more than usual, and how much more fun is that!, If you've got the guilts for not sharing more time with the plethora of Facebook friends, it could be that you're stuck spending more time there than you'd really like to, just to try to keep up with all the friends you feel you need to acknowledge. Is this something you really need to do? Or can you be really honest with yourself and own up that you're doing this half to meet the guilty feeling and half because you're afraid that if you don't, they might stop being your friend? Neither reason is a good one to be frittering away your time on Facebook with people who really mean very little to you other than a few online exchanges.

, Facebook has done a tremendous job in convincing us all that finding a bunch of lovely friends online to share our innermost thoughts with is a cinch. Even with privacy improvements on Facebook and the toning down of mass requests of just anyone wanting friendship, it has still been too easy to have people nose in and insist they ""know X whom you know and so we should all get to know one another"". And then there is that well-meaning but misguided self-styled social media marketing guru friend of yours who just happens to name-drop you to every person he thinks ought to be your friend... So, are these people really ""friends""? What is a friend by your definition and not by Facebook's or social media in general? Don't be afraid to call a friend a friend and an online acquaintance an online acquaintance.


""Facebook friends"" are not automatically ""friend friends"".Make use of both terms with great care, so that you're being discerning in your own mind about which is which.
Is it really so ""cool"" when someone you know nothing about wants to be your friend? Maybe if they're famous but even then, be discerning.

, Channel your energies into doing those other things by making a plan to do them instead of giving the time to Facebook. Now that you've sorted this, proceed to the next step.

, Sure, this sounds brutal but it'll be far worse if you continue interacting with a whole bunch of barely-knowns just because your ego is leading your common sense astray. Being discerning means to exhibit good judgment and insight. Here are some considerations to help you:


Leave (most) family members there (you're free to remove the bratty or mean ones). They'll understand if you can't be bothered interacting with them and if they don't, well it's no big deal, they can bail you up at the next family reunion instead.
Which of your Facebook friends really light up your day and make being on Facebook a joy? Who are those people you're truly proud to be friends with in your real life? Be absolutely honest and write their names down in the ""keep"" list.
Be careful here. The goal of culling should be more than keeping people that make you happy. Also, keep friends who provide unique perspectives. If you include the former and exclude the latter you'll end up with a group of like-minded, flattering friends.
Which of your Facebook friends are barely known to you? The ones who saw that you shared the same cause, the ones who asked to be friends because you know someone who knows someone who probably is a mutual someone somewhere down the line... Just how beneficial are these people in your life? Unless you've really clicked with them and grown a full-blown, mutually supportive friendship with them, put them on the culling list.
Who hasn't answered/liked/shared anything of yours lately? Unless they're family or a truly vague, introspective friend you know personally and care about a lot, consider removing these people too. If they haven't the time for you, you haven't the time for them.
Who has been difficult, inflammatory, bossy, pushy, nosy, noisy, irritating? Cull them.
Anyone who spams you or sends inane and trivial content on a regular basis is not a friend. Reduce their impact by removing them from your list.
Here's the big one. Do you really and truly care less about that reconnection with someone from school given the intervening 25 years of no connection until Facebook came along? Make sure neither of you are friends just because you're preening, being nosy, digging up dirt, or simply getting sadistic pleasure of rifling through their photos and laughing at how dreadful they've turned out. Unless your reconnection was absolutely genuine and mutually supportive, consider ditching these reconnections.
Ex's. They're ex's for a reason; remove them. Now.
And hello there. Is your boss truly your ""friend""?

, Make yourself very comfortable and be sure there are no distractions so that you can get on with finishing the task. The first time will probably take the longest, then it's recommended that you clear out (update) your Facebook friendship list once a month, to stay on top of it.


Keep in mind such things as: What do I know about this person besides their recent updates? Have I had any contact with this person in the past year? Do I enjoy my communications with this person or are they a real burden? Am I just keeping them as friends out of a sense of obligation or as a favor to a friend I do know?Don't feel guilty for removing the people who aren't your real friends. Instead, feel empowered – you, the human, are taking back the power from the machine that wants you to perceive friendships where there are none.

, Stop feeling guilty and take control of your Facebook life instead. If the other person is unable to handle rejection, then they have a learning curve ahead of them but it's not your responsibility to not upset them this way. Moreover, by being proactive up front and knocking back Facebook friend requests before the person even gets a toehold through the door, then you're staying on top of your Facebook and ensuring that your experience remains one of quality, not quantity, and that any engagement on the site is desired, not forced upon you.


Examine their profile with great care. Should something interest you at all, put them on the back foot by asking them the question: ""Please tell me why you want to be my friend. Please tell me more about yourself."""

Basic Purchase Price.,
Fuel Costs.,
Staggered Plantings.",How to Know If Farmville Farm Equipment is Worth the Expense," The first thing to remember is that farm machinery doesn't come cheap. Each of the pieces of equipment available to you will run you 30,000 coins. That's a considerable chunk of change, and you'll want to make sure that buying a seeder, for example, won't leave you with no money left to buy the seeds you want to plant with it.
Also, you're probably not going to be able to buy all three machines at once (for reasons of cost and also because they're unlocked at different levels). Because of this, though, it's a good idea to take into account which machine you'll actually use the most and get that one first. There's nothing wrong with buying these vehicles as long as you're going to get a good amount of use out of them.;
, Another thing you'll have to keep in mind when you're contemplating the purchase of some heavy farm equipment is that the purchase price isn't necessarily the whole cost of the machine. Depending on the size of your farm, you'll use up your fuel pretty quickly with these heavy machines – especially if you have more than one.
If your farm is bigger than what your equipment can cover on one tank of fuel, then, you'll have to consider the benefits of purchasing fuel refills. These refills are available in several sizes, ranging from a single tank to 50 of them, but you can only pay for them with Farm Cash. And because this particular type of currency can be pretty hard to come by, those refills get expensive awfully quickly.
Of course, you can always wait for your tank to fill up again on its own. That doesn't cost you anything, and it doesn't even really take that long. But if you're trying to care for a large farm, you may quickly become frustrated waiting for your fuel to accumulate before you can use your farm equipment again.

, One way around this is to plant a variety of crops that all mature at different rates. That way, you'll never have to plow, plant, and harvest your whole farm at once. As long as you give your machines enough time between usages to refuel naturally, you'll never have to spend a dime on gas. The only trick to this system is making sure that you're not missing out on using them when you'd like to just because you don't have any gas. And the best way to make sure that doesn't happen is to plan your plantings well.

Focus on raising animals that take up the least amount of space.,
Dairy farms take up much less space than 20 individual cows.",How to Guide Animals in Farmville1," Consider that on your farm, space is always at a premium. This list includes the obvious smaller animals, like ducks and bunnies, but also a couple of unexpected others. As long as you have enough neighbors or farm cash you can purchase dairy farms to store your cows. Dairy farms hold up to 20 cows (or 19 cows and 1 bull) each, and you can buy as many as you want.;
, Another benefit is that with one click, you can harvest the milk from all the cows within the dairy farm. Other animals utilize this procedure: Building a chicken coop will save time and space as they can house up to 20 chickens. Unfortunately, there is a limit of 1 chicken coop per farm, so you are best off keeping your total chicken population to 20 in order to fit them all in a coop.

"
"
Acknowledge that all of these animals come from different places.",How to Guide Animals in Farmville2," In fact, the only animals you can buy with coins are sheep and pigs. These animals are not particularly space efficient, nor do they bring in a substantial revenue. There are a few other specialty animals that you can buy with only farm cash – several special varieties of chickens and an orange tabby (at the moment). Usually, a few seasonal animals are available for a limited time.

"
"
If you are patient and have managed to accumulate neighbors, you shouldn't need to buy any animals.",How to Guide Animals in Farmville3," There are quite a few different kinds of animals available as gifts. To get many more types of animals this way, just tell your friends what you'd like to receive.

"
"
Plant on as much land as possible in order to earn coins and experience points quickly.,
Broaden the focus.",How to Improve Your Farmville Skills1," After all, that's the only way to move up and increase your options for game play.;
, Once you've gotten to some of the higher levels, however, there are a lot of things you can do with your property besides farming it. In fact, you may find that your plowed plots are becoming less and less of the focus of the farm as a whole. There's nothing wrong with this, and in fact there are a few distinct benefits that come from shifting your emphasis away from straight farming as you level up.

"
"
Have animals.",How to Improve Your Farmville Skills2," Animals take up space and they can be somewhat tedious to collect from. Dairy farms and chicken coops have takes away a lot of these complications when it comes to cows and chickens though. Other animals may still be cumbersome to keep, but the cows and the chickens can help you create a steady income stream in no time as long as you have these structures to put them in. They make collecting easier and they take up much less space than the animals themselves would if they were left to their own devices.

"
"
Set aside some land to put up buildings on.",How to Improve Your Farmville Skills3," This is also a good way to develop your farm as you level up. Not only will buildings add to the pleasing overall appearance of your property, but putting them up gets you a considerable amount of experience. Some buildings are also useful for either keeping animals (as discussed above), or for storage of excess inventory. Either way, though, making building up your farm a priority will help you level up more quickly, as well as improving the overall aesthetic quality of your property.

"
"
Add decorations.,
Take advantage of the new storage buildings available.",How to Improve Your Farmville Skills4," The higher the level you reach, the more options you'll have for the decorations you can put up. You'll also notice that new decorations will become available depending on the season or approaching holiday. Because of this, you can really alter the look of your farm with decorations depending on what mood strikes you at the time.

, In doing so, you can switch up your farm's look by taking some items out of storage and putting others away for a later time. Plus, selling off old decorations and buying new ones is a good way to rack up some easy experience points without having to wait for the next harvesting and planting cycle.

Crop and Plot Fertilization.,
If you go this route, though, you'll miss out on the opportunity to have your entire farm fertilized when you come back.,
Gifts: Because the game no longer directs you to the free gift page every day when you log into FarmVille for the first time, it's easy to forget to send these special items to your friends.,
Bonuses: Every time your neighbors earn a ribbon, you'll have the opportunity to receive a bonus from them.,
It's never a bad thing to have some extra coins lying around – you can even use them to buy some extra items to earn experience points and level up more quickly.",How to Get the Most out of Your Farmville Neighbors," Of course, it's beneficial to both you and your neighbors if they can fertilize your crops and you can fertilize theirs. You get extra experience points when harvesting fertilized crops, and your neighbors get to earn a few extra coins for each plot of yours they fertilize. However, when you're not going to be able to get back to your farm for an extended period of time, you might think there's no point in plowing your fields since you can't plant on them.;
, Your neighbors can't fertilize fallow land, but they can fertilize plowed plots even if they haven't been planted yet. And when you do return to plant on them, your crops will be instantly fertilized. Also, it's important to pass this information along too. If your friends have to spend some time away from their farm, you want to be able to earn your coins fertilizing their plots as well.

, And, of course, it's easy for your friends to forget to send gifts to you. Even if you don't necessarily need any of the items that you receive as gifts, you can always sell them for some extra coins, so you'll want to remind your neighbors to keep sending them if they've been neglecting this aspect of the game. And the best way to remind them to send gifts your way is to remember to send gifts to them.

, Some of these bonuses are as small as 50 coins, and it may seem like more trouble than it's worth to peruse your news feed to find them all. But these small bonuses add up fast. You'll be missing out on a lot of you don't take advantage of as many as you can find.

, In order to be successful in FarmVille, you need to be able to take advantage of every opportunity that's presented to you, no matter how insignificant it seems at the time.

Target Your Accomplishments.,
Complimentary Sets: Some of the accomplishments rewarded by ribbons are complimentary, but some others are not.,
Some separate ribbons are complimentary, however.,
A Winning Layout: You can also change the layout of your farm in order to earn ribbons more quickly.,
Sharing in the Wealth: Since you can share the wealth with your friends every time you earn a ribbon, you should be sure to take advantage of all of the bonuses you can earn when your friends collect ribbons as well.",How to Get the Most out of Farmville Ribbons," Of course, if you're going to be working on earning ribbons, you'll need to know what you have to do to get them. You can find this out easily enough by simply clicking on the ribbon icon at the bottom of your screen. This will bring up a window that will allow you to peruse the many different types of ribbons that are available and see what you have to do to earn each one.;
, For example, you can earn ribbons by harvesting a certain number of vegetable crops, and another by harvesting a certain number of fruit crops. Because you only have a limited amount of space to devote to your crops, it's best if you focus on one of these achievements first, and then shift to the other. Trying to split your resources between the two will only make it harder for you to accomplish both of them.

, For example, you can earn ribbons by spending money in the market, and you can also earn ribbons by owning a certain number of decorations. Since you have to spend money in the store to accumulate these decorations, you can work towards both of these ribbons simultaneously.

, For instance, if you know you're going after some ribbons that have to do with harvesting or planting crops, you should maximize the amount of space you devote to plowed land. Once you've taken care of these accomplishments, however, you can adjust your layout to reflect your new goals. You don't want to get rid of all of your plowed plots, however – just make sure you have enough space set aside to pursue your new goals.

, Checking your news feed frequently for your friends' announcements and clicking on the link to collect the bonus they're offering is a great way to earn some extra coins and get ahead in FarmVille fast. Just make sure you're offering the bonuses to them as well so that they share with you every time they can.

Don't just plant the cheapest stuff, subtract the cost of the crop+15 coins from the coins you get for selling them and determine the profit (strawberries have a 10 coin profit).,
Plant about 16 of each crop.

,
Don't let the crops wither, or it would only waste money.

,
Get a Good Strategy and Cheats Guide.

,
Manage Costs: These costs are easily managed of course because you're harvesting and selling your crops for more than it cost to plant them.,
Maximize yours earnings per hour: Because you'll be needing your coins for so much in FarmVille, you need to maximize the earning potential of your farm.,
Manage Time: If you're not going to be able to get back to your farm for 8 hours, you're much better off planting the pumpkins.",How to Get a Lot of Money on FarmVille,";
,,,, There are a lot of other items you can buy in the FarmVille market to decorate and build up your farm, and you won't be able to get these without some significant sums of cash. Buying these items will also get you some much needed experience points to help you advance to the next level, so you'll have to find a way to make sure you have enough money for all the discretionary items you want to buy.

, The best way to do this is to figure out which crops pay out the most coins per hour. For example, strawberries sell for 35 coins per plot of land harvested and they take 4 hours to grow. Pumpkins, on the other hand, take 8 hours to grow and sell for 68 coins per plot of land harvested. That means, for the same acreage planted, you'll earn 8.75 coins per hour by planting strawberries, while the pumpkins will only get you 8.5 coins per hour. This may seem like a small difference, but these small amounts can add up fast. Of course, you won't be getting your money's worth unless you can harvest the crops as soon as they're ready and immediately replant on that land.

, The longer you leave a crop after it's done maturing, the less you'll be getting per hour once you harvest it. You can only make money fast on crops that mature quickly if you're going to be able to harvest and replant as soon as they're ready for sale. Make sure you take these details into consideration when you're selecting your seeds at the Market, and you'll be seeing your bank account swelling in no time.

Understand what a roleplayer is.,
Choose your character to roleplay.,
Create a new Facebook account.,
Understand the roleplay language.,
Start roleplaying.,
If you are roleplaying as a celebrity, let people know that you aren't real.,
Keep roleplaying.,
Using symbols for actions.",How to Become a Facebook Roleplayer," Many people don't understand roleplaying at all, and just see roleplayers as posers, which they are most certainly not! The definition of a roleplayer (or Facebook roleplayer in this case) is: someone who assumes or acts out a particular role. Basically, roleplaying involves picking a character from a TV show, movie, book, or even from the celebrity line-up and acting as them. It's exactly the same thing on Facebook. Just make sure to tell people that you are a roleplayer and who you are supposed to be, so that everyone is clear as to what is happening.;
, Either select someone as discussed in the previous step or make up your own character. This latter creation is known as an ""original roleplayer"". Or, you mix a bit of reality and fantasy together to create your own character based on the category of a TV show, movie, or book. For example, you could create a character who is supposed to be a media or literary character's nonexistent brother, sister, boyfriend, etc. This is quite handy for favorite characters who were killed off, changed for the worst or simply disappeared!

, Instead of using your actual Facebook account, just make a new one to roleplay on. Make absolutely sure that if you are roleplaying as a celebrity to put in your name that you're fake or put 'Rp' for Roleplay. Look up roleplayers from your genre of roleplay. For example, if you were to choose to be a Harry Potter roleplayer, you would look up Harry Potter characters in the Facebook search box, add them, and then roleplay with them.

, Don't be caught off guard – there are some key Facebook roleplay terms that it's important to know and understand. Here are some key ones:



Rp – Roleplay, or RPer would be roleplayer.

OOC – Out of character. You would use this if you are writing a status as the real you. For example, 'OOC: My real boyfriend just proposed to me!' You can also use double parenthesis. For example, ((I gotta go. Let's continue next time)).
// When writing on another roleplayers' wall as the real you. For example, '//Want to roleplay?'.

Starter – this is what you need to start roleplaying and is used for starting the roleplay session. Make a starter by writing on that person's wall. Starters are usually hard for a lot of roleplayers to write, but just a ""I was walking down the streets of town when I saw, . ""Hello!"" I called out, running and hugging "" will do. Then they reply on your wall and this will start a roleplay!

Para only – this means that you paragraph roleplay. Usually all replies and starters are about a five to seven sentence paragraphs and contain lots of detail.

, When roleplaying with somebody, make sure not to use chat speak language. Use good spelling and grammar so that they can understand you. Make sure to notify them before you start roleplaying with them, then send them a starter.

, Sometimes people think you are real, or that you're ""posing"". To make sure that people know that you aren't that celebrity, try putting the word(s) ""Fake"" or ""Not Real"" in your name. Also, add the real celebrity, then tag them in a post. For example, write a status putting @ and then the person's name, saying ""I am a roleplayer, and @(Celebrity's name) Is the real.""

, Now you are a roleplayer! Now it's time to spread your wings and try a few more things. Here are some good beginning things to try:


Find a boyfriend or a girlfriend. Make absolutely certain that the person is also a roleplayer before ""wooing"" them. Also, if you are a lesbian or gay roleplayer, make sure that they are, too, before you ask them out, so they won't block you or delete you. To ask them out, just say, ""Hello, I noticed that we are both single roleplayers, and want to know if you would be my (girlfriend/boyfriend) on roleplay only. Please let me know if you are interested,"" in a message to them.
Broaden your additions. Don't only add roleplayers from the same category as you. Just because you are a Harry Potter roleplayer doesn't mean you can't add Twilight roleplayers. You can end up having a lot of fun if you mix things up a little bit.
Add family members, too, or join a family. 'ShadowCullen's' and 'McJonas' are two popular Facebook roleplay families.

, If you don't feel like writing paragraphs, you can just talk normally like you usually would. For actions you can use symbols like *. For example, *hugs you really tight*.
