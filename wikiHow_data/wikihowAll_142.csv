, On the Facebook homepage, enter in your first name, last name, email address, password, birthday, and gender. You must use your real name for your account. Nicknames are allowed as long as they are a variation on your real name (Jim instead of James, for example).

, If all of your information is correct, you will be sent a verification email to the address you provided.

, It may take a few minutes for the email to get delivered. Click the link in the email to activate your account.

, The first thing you should do after creating an account is add a profile picture. This will allow others to quickly see who you are, making conversations between friends and family easier.

, Facebook is nothing if you don't have friends and family to share with. You can search for people by their name or email, import your contact lists, and invite friends that aren't currently using Facebook.


When you find someone that you want to add, you will need to send a friend invite. Once they accept your invitation, that person will be added to your Friends list.

, There are countless horror stories of people posting things that they don't want others to see, or losing a job because of something controversial they shared. Take some time to set up your privacy settings to prevent the wrong people from seeing what you post.

, You can post to your own timeline or post to your friends' timelines. You can also share content from elsewhere on the internet, including links, images, and videos.

, Facebook allows you to chat with anyone on your friends list. If the person you are chatting with is not online, they will receive your message the next time they log in. You can also download the Messenger app for your phone to chat on the go.

, Facebook allows you to upload your photos to post to your profile and share with friends and family. You can upload single photos or organize your photos into albums. Make sure to not upload anything containing questionable content.

, You can use Facebook to create events and invite people. You can set the date and time, enter a location, make posts for people that will be attending, and invite specific people. Facebook events are quickly becoming one of the main ways that people organize gatherings.

Consider the alternatives.,
Note whether you've received a message from this person lately.,

Search for the person on Facebook while logged out.,
Google them.,
Ask others.,
Be attentive.,
Set aside paranoia, irritation, or worry.,

If the person that blocked you is a member of a group that you are an admin of, you will be able to see their posts and comments, although their name will be unclickable and you will be unable to interact with their content.",How to Find Out Who Has Blocked You on Facebook," The steps below will outline some scenarios where it's likely that you've been blocked, but there's no guarantee. If your alleged blocker has been temporarily blocked for violating Facebook policies, this could be a reason you're not able to see them. It could also be that the person has deactivated or deleted their account altogether.;
, If you are blocked, they will not receive your messages at all. So, if a person does respond to a message you sent, you are not blocked. If they don't respond, you may or may not be blocked. Either they aren't receiving your messages because they've blocked you, or they're just ignoring your messages. Continue with your investigation.

, If you can find them, then you can rest assured that you haven't been blocked. (When someone blocks you, it prevents you from finding them on Facebook.) If you can't find them, it may be that you are blocked, or it may be that they have their privacy settings adjusted so they can't be found.


Don't bother searching for this person while logged into a different account. If you find them through that account and not through yours, it could be for a variety of reasons:

If the account you're using isn't friends, or a friend of a friend of that person, and you use a standard search, it's just like searching for them while logged out, which is discussed in the next step. Note: If the account you are using isn't friends, or a friend of a friend of that person and you don't find them, you might still find them by looking through the list of friends of known friends of them. If you do find them this way while using a totally unrelated account but don't find them the same way while using your own account, there is a high chance that they've blocked you.
If the account you're using IS friends, or a friend of a friend of that person, and you find them through that account but not through yours, it may just mean they have their privacy setting adjusted so they can only be found by those people (friends, or friends of friends). It doesn't necessarily mean you've been blocked.



, If you can find them while logged out but not while logged in, it means they have their settings so they can be searched by everyone except you. That means you've been blocked.

, Google is the most widely used search engine, so give it a go to see if it has knowledge of this possibly blocked friend.


Log out of your Facebook account.
Search for the person's known Facebook name inside quotation marks. For example, ""Brad Pitt"", ""Daisy F Football"", etc.
If there is a search engine return, click on it.
In a separate window, log into Facebook. Go back to that search engine result and click on it again. Is it different? Does it show you something different than what you saw before? Does it tell you that profile doesn't exist? If so, you're probably blocked.
If the friend doesn't come up in search results, don't jump to any conclusions. It could be that they adjusted their setting so their profile can't be crawled by search engines, or their profile simply hasn't been indexed by Google yet.

, At the risk of looking desperate, angry, or just plain nosy, you could consider asking other people if they know whether something's up. This method will depend entirely on whether or not you feel comfortable asking others and are able to handle the ramifications of your mutual friend knowing you've been blocked:


Ask mutual friends online. Ask them if the possible blocker is still appearing actively on their Facebook feed. An affirmative answer is all you need to know you've been blocked.
Ask friends offline. If you're in a close-knit group of friends offline and it's one of your offline friends who seems to have blocked you, ask your friends if they know anything. Again, you need to be ready for answers you might not like hearing and it could mean that more is up for your personal friendship than you're willing to grasp!

, None of the following are ""proofs"" in and of themselves but they might help you to build a picture that points to your having been blocked:


Chatter on your Facebook wall that seems to be involving your possibly blocked friend, or doesn't make sense without him or her being part of the updates.
Check your own updates and see if you have said anything that might have been potentially offensive or upsetting to your supposed blocker. You will often have a gut feeling about this if you know their leanings and feelings well.
Check their Twitter name if you know it. If they're still pointing to a Facebook address or leaving tweets about using their Facebook, that's a sign they're still actively using Facebook and that you might have been blocked.
Check any other mutually followable accounts you have where you know this person has an account. For example, Twitter, YouTube, Ping, LinkedIn, etc. Have they removed you from mutual following on any of these? If so, you might be at the receiving end of a very big message...

, If another person decides to block you, how much are you willing to let this interfere with your personal life? Facebook is just another way to communicate with people and in the real world, sometimes people shun you for the most bizarre reasons of their own and you just have to learn to live with it. Facebook is no different! Try to see it with a good heart and without taking it personally.


Some social media users suffer from narcissistic tendencies that cause them to take slight easily and to feel superior.This could lend them to readily dropping ""friends"" if they feel put out. If you've been entangled with one, perhaps the blocking is a blessing.
Some social media users have a sudden urge that drives them to clean out their friends in the hope they can control an online addiction/overuse or simply to ""cut out all of the noise"". It's not likely you're going to change their mind when this is the reason behind a block. Take comfort in knowing that if this is the reason for a block, then you're probably not the only person they blocked.
Think very carefully about what knowing who has blocked you will bring about. It's not as if you can claim mutual satisfaction by blocking them back – they won't care! If it makes you so angry or annoyed that you need to be rude to them or say unkind things to mutual friends about them, then perhaps there was substance to their desire to blocking you. It's best to leave it be and think ""who cares?!""

, If you have another email-id (if not, you can make one), then make another account on Facebook and check if you can see the person from this new account.

, If you know the person's numerical user ID, you can try to access their profile picture at http://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/(user ID)/picture (usernames no longer work as of June 2015, but you can find a user's numerical ID here as long as their profile hasn't been deactivated). If a normal profile picture shows up and the redirected URL starts with https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-xpa1, then the profile is active. If it shows a placeholder image and the new URL starts with https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php, then the profile has been deactivated.

, This is to prevent users from causing trouble in groups after blocking the admins.

If you don't want him to know that you like him, don't act suspiciously, add other people after adding him, so, he will know that you went on an adding spree, not that you just wanted to add him in particular, also, make sure to have mutual friends, you do not want to come across as a creep.;
, As you know, you cannot see who goes to your wall as Facebook does not allow it, but you can know who looks at the stuff you have on your wall. For example, you like a new found artist and you decided to Like the artist's page, on your activity log will show that you liked the page.

, If the guy likes you, he would most likely pay a couple of visits to your wall, knowing that you might Like a couple of things and to show you or impress you, he will Like the same thing or something similar.

, A lot of the time, a nice, maybe even ""winky"" comment can show some feelings of affections. If there's any comments such as 'Hey beautiful!' you know that he finds you attractive. If the comments read more like 'This is a nice picture of you! :)' he probably likes you for more than your looks.

, A lot of :) or ;) usually means that there's something there. If he compliments you and it's a conversation killer, it's probably a good sign.

, If he adds comments to your statuses often, he probably likes talking to you and wants you to notice him. Comment on his statuses and see how things go and how he responds.

, If you talk to him, comment on his photos, etc, chances are his real self will be unraveling, and he might even reveal his crush on you.

, Seeing him in person might make him shy if you're not too close, but if you develop a relationship outside of Facebook, it will be much better and healthier.

, You cannot really be sure unless you talk to him. Start with a simple hello or poke him. You can also check out the pages he Liked that are similar to yours and ask him things like ""Hey. Do you know the band ""Halestorm?"".""

Add the girl that you want if you haven't already: (How can you talk to someone on Facebook that you don't have added?,
Make sure that your profile info is short and basic but also says a lot at the same time: Make it so you look friendly, outgoing and confident.,
Show your Interests:


If you have the girl added (which you should) you should be able to go and just look at their interests on their page.,
Know how to approach her:


IF you have the confidence and the balls to go and just post on her wall, go ahead and do it.

,


i.e. My name is ...
Want to know more? ""Let's get to know each other some then.
by the grace of god,f you can get other women to post on your wall, get them to post on your wall, this shows competition.
Make sure your profile picture or any other pictures are ""on point."" and displays your best features such as your eyes, personality or something interesting.

, ""musicians, hobbies, just stuff you two have in common""
Try to remember these and take note because this makes a great conversation which will be used in the following step.

, Hey, I added you because you looked familiar but I don't think I've actually talked to you before but we don't really know each other much, you look pretty interesting and we may have a lot in common."" is a good example
another way is by playing a game of ""truth is"" Which is where you post ""truth is...?"" as your status and people like it, and you give them your opinion of them.
If she likes the status, say ""truth is, you seem really interesting and someone that is easy to get along with but I don't really know you, want to change that?""
if she agrees, you should be able to literally ask for her number and she'll give it to you.

,
But for the love of god, don't poke. NEVER POKE.
Just have a casual and normal conversation, ask her ""what's up"" or ask her what kind of music she's in to.
Do whatever you can do to get her to talk. and make sure that you understand and comprehend what she's saying. if she's talking to you, she's interested a little bit. which is all that matters.
If you did message/ IM her, just say that you have to get off to go do something, use ""hey, I'll talk to you later because I have to go and get something done. Text me?"" She WILL more than likely say yes, unless you screwed up somewhere along the line in the previous steps.

, Try to see if she wants to go and see the new movie that's coming out. or maybe you really lucked out and both of you guys' favorite artist is in town.
just try to get her to be in person with you, that's all that matters.

,


Just keep your cool.
remain confident
keep her talking.

Of course, it may sound pretty obvious to say that you should click on her profile to see if she’s single, but it may not be as simple as that. You may have to do a bit more digging than that. For example, she may be dating someone who isn’t on Facebook and may not list her relationship status, she may be “married” to one of her female friends as a joke while dating someone, or she may be very clearly into someone else. How do you find that out? Here are a few tips:


Scroll through her pictures. See a lot of photos of her with some other guy? Do people comment about how “cute” the photos are? If so, then she may be off the market.
Check out her wall. Is there a guy whose wall she posts on a lot, or a guy she seems to be in conversation with a lot? If so, then this may be the guy she’s dating.
See if she posts a lot of mysterious messages that allude to the fact that she’s dating someone. She may post love songs, have winking emoticons, or make comments about liking someone that seem a little bit confusing. This may be a sign that she likes someone or is dating someone but she doesn’t want to be open about it.
Then again, if it seems like she’s not dating someone but that she may just have a crush on someone, then nothing’s stopping you from trying to swoop her up!;
, Whether you know the girl or not, it’s important to have a profile that is interesting and up-to-date. If she gets in the habit of chatting with you a lot, or commenting on your Facebook posts, then chances are that she’ll be taking a peek at your profile. If that’s the case, then you should make sure you have fun, flattering photos, an interesting profile, and some comments that make her laugh. Here are some ways to make sure your profile makes you appealing to the girl you’re chatting with:


Have a profile photo that isn’t too cocky and actually shows what you look like. Girls want guys who are real, not posers.
Post some interesting links or clips on your timeline, but don’t post so often that it looks like you have no life.
Look through the other photos of yourself and make sure there’s nothing that makes you look too immature or like a player.

, If you want to play it cool and get the girl to like you without coming on too strong, then give her at least 10-15 to be online before you ask her, “What’s up?” This will show that you haven’t been sitting around Facebook waiting for her to sign online, but that you just happened to be on and want to see how she’s doing. Of course, you may miss out if she signs off after two minutes, but you’ll look more chill if you do talk to her after she’s been online for a little while.


If she’s online on her mobile phone (you’ll see the logo on the chat bar), then this may not be the best time to chat her. She may be busy and may not even realize that she’s signed into chat just because she has Facebook open on her phone.

, When you do message her, you can start with something casual and light so you don’t make it seem like you’ve been stalking her profile. You can just say, “What’s up?” “How was your day?” or ask her about something simple like how her soccer game went or what she thought of the math test from the class you have together. You don’t have to make the most fascinating comment at first and should focus on getting the conversation going instead; in fact, if you try to be fascinating too soon, it’ll show.


If you’ve never talked to her in person before, make sure she really knows who you are. A lot of people have Facebook friends and forget how they know the person in real life.
Just say something like, “How’s it going?” or a question that requires more of a direct answer, like, “How was your soccer game?” to get the conversation going.

, After you get the ball rolling, you can start talking about topics that will interest the girl and will keep her talking. It all really depends on what you’re interested in and what you think she’ll care about. You can talk about some gossip in your school (without being too mean), the class you have together, something crazy in the local news, or what you’re doing this summer.


If she’s interested, then she’ll respond a lot, make funny comments, and will ask questions. If there’s a radio silence on her end, you may need to change the subject.

, If you don’t know her well, you can try cruising her Facebook profile for some hints of what she’s into, from which bands she likes to whether or what her other hobbies are, whether she likes to run or hike. You don’t have to say that you’ve looked at her profile, but bring them up naturally in conversation. You can also connect over growing up in the same place, playing the same sport, having similar political views, or a number of other topics.


Don’t stress too much if you think you have nothing in common. You can build a solid relationship just from sharing one or two of the same interests. You don’t have to have the exact same taste in music, books, and sports to start dating.

, If you want the girl to keep talking to you, then you should let her know that you really do care about her. At first, just keep the conversation light and breezy, but subtly work in some compliments to keep the conversation moving forward. You can say something like, “It’s so easy to talk to you” or “You crack me up.” Let her know that you really appreciate her personality and that you look forward to your conversations.


You can carefully even compliment her looks in one of the photos she posted. You can say, “That’s a cute dress” or “Your hair looks pretty like that.” Just don’t overdo it or you may creep her out.

, It’s one thing to make interesting conversation online and to build your relationship with a girl over Facebook. However, it’s another to always be online waiting for her, to message her the second she gets on, and to send her a million messages while she barely responds. Make sure that you’re both messaging each other first about the same amount, that you’re not online 24/7, and that it seems like she’s as interested in the conversation as you are.


You don’t want her to feel like you’ll be on Facebook every time she signs on. Leave her wondering whether or not you’ll be there.

, If you want the girl to be interested in you, then you have to show her that you have things going on besides uploading new photos to your Facebook account. You can talk about fun weekend plans you’re having, something you’re looking forward to that evening, or just mention some friends you’re going to see later. You shouldn’t lie to make your life seem cooler than it really is, but you should let her see that you’re more than just the guy who is always on Facebook.


If you’re leaving to celebrate your Aunt Bertha’s 50th birthday, you don’t have to tell her that. Just say, “I have to go meet some people,” so you keep it vague enough for her to know that you have plans without knowing all the details.

, Though this can be creepy at first, once you get to know her, you can talk about some of the things she posted online. If she posted a photo of her and her friends spending the weekend at Lake Tahoe, then you can ask her how the trip went. If she posts a news article that she cares about, you can talk to her about it — as long as it doesn’t lead to a fight. This can give you something to talk about and can keep your conversation going strong.


You shouldn’t do this at the beginning of the conversation, but use it as a resource if you run out of other things to talk about.

, If you really want to catch the girl’s eye, then you have to show her that you care about who she is as a person. If she mentions something, like an upcoming dance recital, bring it up the next time, asking how it went. If you saw her in school and noticed she was wearing a new dress or cut her hair, give her a compliment (without being creepy). Let her know that you actually pay attention to her and that you take note of her looks and of what she says.


You can say something like, “So how did the math test go? Was it as bad as you thought?” Or, “Did you end up having fun at your uncle’s birthday party?” This will show her that you care about the details.
If you need a refresher on what you talked about, then you can always scroll through your conversation.

, Another thing you can do to keep her hooked is to end the conversation when it’s getting good. You don’t want to have a great convo for a while and then run out of things to say before you have to get going. Find a time when the conversation is really interesting and then begin to wrap it up before you sign off, so you leave her wanting more.


Of course, you should still be nice and tell her you have to get going instead of signing off abruptly.
This advice is true for talking to the girl in person, too. You should part ways while the conversation is going great, instead of when things are lagging, in order to leave a good impression.

, One thing you can do is to ask the girl out, or even ask her to be your girlfriend, over Facebook. Though some girls may wish you had done this in-person, if you have a really strong bond online and think that she would respond well, then you can consider asking her out right over the Internet. Many people would warn you against this, but if you think this is right for you and your girl, then you can try simply finding a moment when the timing is right, and then asking her if she’d like to be your girlfriend.


Asking her out online can help take some of the pressure off both of you. You don’t have to worry so much about saying the perfect thing because you’ll be typing, and she won’t have to worry so much about giving the perfect answer for the same reason.

, Though you may have really fallen in love over the Internet, it can help you to get a better sense of who the girl is, and whether or not you’re really compatible, by spending some time with her in person. If you’re in the same school or live nearby, then start by initiating casual group hangouts with her, and then see if you can hang out solo, even if you’re just grabbing lunch, taking a walk, or seeing a movie. This can give you a better sense of whether or not you two would be a great match.


Just be casual about it. Say something like, “I’m hanging out at the mall with a few of my buddies this weekend. Do you want to come join us with a few friends?” Or, “Are you checking out the carnival tonight? I’ll be there with a few people.”

, Whether you’re hanging out solo in person, or just chatting online, before you pop the question, you should get a sense of whether or not the girl likes you as more than a friend. Though you may get along great, she may think of you as more of a buddy, or she may just have her eye on someone else. When you’re with her or talking to her, see if she’s really excited to you, if she flirts a bit, and if she asks you questions about your life. Think about it more to see if she has a crush on you.


Of course, you’re not a mind reader, and it can be tricky to know whether or not she really likes you if you’re only talking online. It can be hard to pick up on things like her tone and personality if you don’t get a lot of face time.

, If you’ve decided to ask her to be your girlfriend, then you have to find the right moment to ask her, whether you’re asking online or in person. If you’re asking online, then you should find a moment in the conversation where you’re complimenting each other, having a great chat, or talking about hanging out soon. If you’re in person, make sure you’re alone, that she’s in a good mood, and that you’re really connecting before you ask.


Once the timing and moment is right, just tell her that you really like her and that you’d love it if she was your girlfriend. It doesn’t have to be an elaborate speech and she’ll really appreciate the directness. Just say, “I’ve really liked getting to know you. You’re so smart and funny and so easy to talk to. I would love it if you would be my girlfriend.”

, Whether she says yes or no, it’s important to react in a way that makes you look like a mature gentleman. If she says she’d like to be your girlfriend, then you should do a little dance, let her see how happy you are, and show her some affection. If she turns you down, then act like it’s no big deal. Tell her you hope you can still be friends and that you appreciate her honesty.


If your relationship does blossom into a full-fledged boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, then you can focus on spending more time together in person, and less time flirting with her on the Internet.

Be realistic.",How to Avoid Being in a Facebook Relationship With Your Boyfriend," Explain why you don't want your relationship to be known online. Tell him that you want it to be kept offline and personal, not something that gets splashed about for everyone to treat as ""their business"".;
, Good reasons include:


Less pressure
No unwanted curiosity
No blackmail possibilities
No attempts to break up the two of you publicly
People won't know when or if you break up unless you choose to tell them.

, This is an issue you need to deal with, as communication is very important in relationships, but these tips can help you dodge the bullet for now. Some excuses/actions might include:


Say that you haven't a clue how to use the site, and act stubborn so he doesn't offer top help.
Say your parents are keeping an eye on your account.
Tell him you don't like Facebook.

, It becomes a sort of joke, and you can't accept his request. This is best done in advance of a relationship, so if you know now you won't want to put any relationship on facebook, 'propose' to a friend.

, Tell him that only braggers and people with unfulfilled lives want to splash everything about their personal life across the internet. Make him feel that doing this is beneath the two of you!

, If you aren't 'married' to a friend on facebook, then delete your relationship status altogether. Wanting to be listed as single is very different from not wanting your relationship publicized.

, If he really cares about it, pay attention to what he says when he argues about it. Address his concerns. Some things he might say:



""You don't really want to be with me."" Reassure him that you do, and that he is important to you. Explain that this is how you feel about relationships and facebook, not how you feel about him.

""You just want to flirt with other guys."" Again, make sure you aren't listed as single. Explain that it isn't about flirting, it's about privacy. If he can't trust you, maybe this wouldn't work out anyway.

""If you really loved me, you would want to show it."" Talk about how you wouldn't make out in front of a crowd, and how this feels like excessive PDA to you. If he can't get past this manipulative statement, he needs to grow up.

""Why are you talking about breaking up? Do you want to break up with me?"" Tell him how, if you two ever broke up, it would be really hard for you, and you don't want everyone getting involved. Emphasis that if you broke up, you would be really upset and don't want that to be public.

, If, after all your discussion, he still feels strongly about it, rethink your position. How much does this matter to you? If it is only a mild preference, then it might be your turn to compromise.

, If all else fails, maybe it just isn't meant to be between you two. If you can't agree on a Facebook status, it's a bad sign.

If the girl doesn’t know you well, she’ll want to be able to see your face and get a vibe from you.Rather than going for something abstract, make your profile default picture a clear headshot, preferably with you smiling, dressed well, and looking good.
Don’t go for any overly posed mirror selfies; you don’t want to look like a narcissist.
Make sure your images is a high resolution shot that’s nicely cropped. Pixelated photos with half of your face cut off will not look good.
Save your other photos — pictures that are more than one year old, baby pictures, and pictures with other people — for your other albums.;
, Your page’s cover photo can be an important addition to your profile pic and is a great space for you to show some of your personality.


Consider, for example, color coordinating your cover photo to match or compliment your profile picture. Or, use this space to display a photo of an art piece you especially admire.
While your profile pic should only be a photo of you, you can use a group shot as the cover photo. If you have friends in common with the girl you're after, take a photo of you with these mutual friends and post it. This way she can see you hanging with the same people she likes to hang with.

, Take some time to make sure your information in the “about” section of your page is up-to-date.Be thorough and fill out most of the sections, including your birthday, school, job, etc.
Be especially sure to fill out the ""interested in"" and ""relationship status"" sections. Make yourself visible to the girl your interested in as also interested in girls and single.

, If you can see what the girl is into, mirror a couple of her likes and interests by liking them too.


It’ll help break the ice between you too if you have some interests in common, so doing some research into what she’s into before you make contact is extremely important.
Ideally, you’ll have naturally overlapping interests, but it never hurts to add a couple of her favorite bands, TV shows, movies, book, or restaurants to your favorites as well.

, You’ll have more chances of impressing a girl and getting her to like you if you seem like an interesting person.One way to appear cool is to keep you wall activity strategically full with interesting content, like funny status updates, and interesting news store, or photos of the fun stuff you're doing. Photos are the most interesting and visually captivating of all the content you can post on your wall and will be the most likely thing to catch your girl's eye.Limit banal posts about daily activities like going to school or studying for a test, and try to only post once a day so you don't look too addicted to Facebook or the internet.
RSVP to interesting or cool events and make sure they appear on your wall. You want to look like a fun person who does fun stuff!
Out smart the new Facebook EdgeRank algorithm by posting content (mostly photos) that you know will get lots of ""likes"" and thus ensure that you will show up in the girl's feed., You might want to tighten up some of your security settings so that you can hide certain potentially embarrassing or unfavorable things while your trying to get someone to like you on Facebook.


You might want to disable photo tagging capabilities, even if just temporarily, just so you can control what kinds of photos of you your friends can post.
Be vigilant as to what others are posting on your page. Intercept anything that could look bad in the eyes of the girl your trying to impress.

, If you’re not already friends with her, you’ll first need to start by establishing a friend connection. Don’t include a message just yet, and wait for her to follow-up after you send the request.


When she responds, play up the fact that you have mutual friends or that you attend the same school or live in the same town. Use any of these as the reason why you’d like to get to know her better.
If she asks why you friended her, be honest! Even it is just because you liked her profile photos, let her know and ask if you can chat online and get to know her better. Chances are she’ll be flattered and interested in learning more about you, too.
Keep it simple and safe. Don’t pressure her for a phone number or come across too pushy. You’re still in the ice breaking phase and you don’t want to scare her away by seeming to aggressive or forward.

, It’s best to initiate contact via private message, so that she doesn’t feel too publicly pressured.Put some thought into your first message; have a good icebreaker comment rather than just writing “hi” out of the blue.
For example, If there an event or something just happened at school, ask her what she though about it; or, if her favorite show just aired, ask her if she watched it and use that to initiate a conversation., Communicating through messages is a great way to test out your potential compatibility and to get her to like you before you meet face to face.Try to offer something new with every message to keep the conversation going.
Wait a bit between answers so you don’t look desperate by always answering immediately. Space out your reply to once a day in order to build anticipation.
Make it about her. Don’t let the conversation get to one sided, where you just end up talking about yourself. Make sure that she feels like you’re into learning more about her.
After you exchange messages for a while, ask if you can chat through the Facebook instant messenger. This way to can have more of an immediate, “real life” type of conversation.

, Send her thoughtful images or things that align with her interests. If she’s into cats, for example, send her a cute cat sticker.

, Don’t use profanity or leave off-color jokes on her wall.


Research has shown that it can be difficult to express or read jokes through internet communication.That said, it’s best not to push the envelop too much with jokes that can be misinterpreted as offensive or off-putting.
Politics and religion can be great topics to talk about, but not necessarily when you’re just getting to know someone and trying to get them to like you. Leave these kinds of polarizing topics for a later date., Stay in the loop with things that she posts and give some them the thumbs up.


Leave thoughtful and complimentary comments, especially when she knew photos of herself.
Don’t overdo it though and “like” everything she posts, you don’t want to look too eager.

, Use invite features to let her know when fun stuff is happening; it’s a way of inviting her to hang out with you without having to take the full plunge of asking her out on a “date.” That will be the next step once you're ready to meet outside of Facebook!

Be yourself!",How to Flirt on Facebook," When you start making passes, the first thing the object of your desire is going to do is pull up your timeline and profile. In face-to-face flirting, the first thing somebody will see are your eyes and your smile. What do they see when they look at yours?


A friendly face and smile in your profile pic, and an interesting cover photo gives the impression that you're probably a smart, fun person—somebody that would be fun to hang with.
An overtly political, religious, or opinion message as your cover photo will send a very strong signal—one that may or may not be appreciated, and certainly more risky than something geared more to your personality than your beliefs.
If you planning on flirting with a friend of a friend, be sure to set the privacy options of your profile so that things you want to share—profile pics, certain albums, the About Me section—are all viewable by friends of friends at least.;
, Pictures of animals are cute. But unless you're a dog or cat that's learned to navigate the internet, save the pet pictures for an album. Similarly, using a movie star's image, or a Simpson-esque cartoon caricature of yourself is best left somewhere other than your profile image. Silly photos and pet photos send a couple of signals: one is that you may not be attractive, and the second, that you may be very private. Neither of these are bad, in and of themselves—but if you're going to flirt on a social network, they're counterproductive.


If you're insecure about your looks, have a professional portrait done. Photographers are experts at how to best present their subjects, and will likely do a much better job than you holding your phone out and doing a self portrait.
If you really love your puppies, or really think looking like a Simpsons character is fun, that's wonderful! Have lots of photo albums with all the fun pictures you want—as long as they are not profile pictures.
Try not to load up your photo album with endless pictures of ex lovers. Somebody might get the idea that you're a player, and nobody likes to be played.
If you are very protective of your privacy, then reconsider flirting on Facebook. Find a mutual friend or two, and get together the old-fashioned way: with a face-to-face introduction.

, If you're interested in somebody, don't lurk, especially after you've made ""eye"" contact by commenting on a post or photo. Just like if you're in a social setting, if you make eye contact, don't cross the room to say hello, but constantly steal furtive glances, you're going to gradually increase the creep factor.


Instead of your interest thinking ""He (or she) is pretty cute,"" they'll soon be thinking to themselves, ""Why does that person keep staring at me?""
If you've noticed them, and you've commented on a message or photo or two (or three), the next step is clear:

, If there's a comment you find interesting, or a photo that really is good, drop them a message and tell them. You don't have to gush, and you don't have to critique—you just have to be interesting enough to get a response. That's it!


For guys, if you're bold, and you know the girl, try using a pickup line. Don't do this if you don't know the girl, however, because chances are she'll just ignore you:

""My heart is mine but whenever I argue with it about you, it takes your side. Can you make it stop?""
""Your profile picture is absolutely the most stunning picture I have seen in the past three minutes.""
""You are the first person who has been able to make my heart beat slower and faster at the same time.""


If you don't know the person you're about to flirt with and just happened on their profile, go for a more indirect approach:

""Hi, you don't know me, but I came across your profile and it made me stop. I'm glad I did. You seem like a really interesting person.""
""Hi. You know how Facebook is a jungle? Well, I was doing my Tarzan thing and I came across you. And now there's no real reason to move on. How are you?""
""Hi, I really never do this, but your profile just made me want to talk to you, which I imagine you get a lot. A penny for your thoughts?""


If they respond, keep the chat going. Find out more about them, and keep a sense of interest and playfulness going. It doesn't have to be a comedy routine—just let them know that you're somebody who enjoys life, and enjoys them. They'll make the connection.

, Facebook is a social network, after all, so it's perfectly natural for you to use your friends as something to talk about and someone to relate to. If you're on good terms with a mutual friend, they'll be more likely to give you a chance.


Talk about something funny, amazing, weird a friend did. It might make you seem gracious and/or good-humored.

""Did you see what posted on his wall? I thought only girls screamed like that!""
""That piece that sent you the other day. So cool, isn't it? I guess we're lucky that the Internet is so...weird?!""
""What an awesome video you posted on wall. Have you seen this one? Shades of grey, I guess you could say!""


Discuss your mutual friend. Asking direct, non-suggestive questions about the person you both know will help develop an easier comfort between you two.

""How do you know ? tells me that you're definitely a person I should know.""
""How long have you known ? I shouldn't admit this but I was there when was born.""



, Not all of them, all the time: that's moving into ""creepy stalker"" territory. On the other hand, interesting posts or pictures are a good chance to continue to develop rapport.


Keep your comments concise and appropriate. Comments that are lengthy, deep, and provocative may work for emails and conversations, but are tedious for both your special friend and for the other people following their post.
The best approach for online flirting is to keep the objective in mind: flirting! Commenting on their posts should become secondary. The area to develop is the private chat, and you should have a good sense within a couple days if there is something there to pursue.

, No more suggestive remarks, or one-liners, or questions about your mutual friend. Tell them how you feel. Not all will respond, but some will be flattered by your complete honesty.


If you're flirting with a guy, this step is easier than cutting pie:

""Hey there. Why doesn't a handsome guy like you have a girlfriend? You seem like quite a catch.""
""Hi. I just wanted to say that you make me a little crazy, in a good way. Wanna go for coffee?""
""I'm not usually this forward, but I want to get to know you better. Will you let me?""


If you're flirting with a girl, you have to be a little more careful and poetic with what you say:

""I know that we don't know each other too well, but I think we'd hit it off if we gave it a chance. I'll respect your decision either way; I want you to feel comfortable. But I couldn't at least not try.""
""I don't usually say this to girls, but I think you're beautiful. I know I don't have much more go off of just quite yet, but I really want to get to know you.""
""I don't want to sound too forward, but do you know the effect you have on me? I can't speak for other guys, but I keep thinking about you because I can't get you out of my mind. I don't want to be rude, but I'd love to talk with you more in person.""



, If your flirtations are working, you will have graduated from comments about her kitten to double entendres, suggestive (not crass) remarks, and growing perception of things to come.


If you've reached this point, wait no longer. Propose a date. It might be dinner at that new restaurant, or a movie by that director you both love, or an Ansel Adams exhibit. Make it something you both will be sure to like, since you've already built that foundation. You have built that foundation, haven't you?
On the other hand, if you've been met with a stone wall, s/he just might not be that into you. If so, don't keep following up on the chat, back off the comments (unless there's something virtually anybody—not just a romantic interest—might find interesting, and set your sights on somebody more accessible.

, We've saved the best flirting tip for last, and it applies to Facebook flirting and real life, too! If you are really interested in somebody, and they respond to your overtures, be confident—that's the biggest turn on there is. Have fun!

Begin chatting.,
See if he flirts back.,
Ask him out.,
Ask him on a date.,
You can also just try to be friends again, because sometimes they can lead to not being friends anymore.",How to Ask a Boy out While Chatting on Facebook," Start with a friendly greeting like ""Hi, how are you?"" You could try cracking a few jokes or reminisce about how much fun you two had at school that day. You could try to mention something fun you did; e.g ""BTW, remember when we...?"" Try to build a sense of closeness with him. This will strengthen the bond between the two of you, and also relax both him and you a little!;
, If he does it's a pretty clear sign he's into you, if he doesn't it doesn't always mean he doesn't like you. If he starts showing signs of being uncomfortable with what you are saying, back off and give some space.

, If he flirts back and is acting interested then it's the perfect time to finally do what you've been waiting for! Ask him if he would like to be your boyfriend or of you want to go on a date. A simple ""Will you go out with me?"" will do the trick.

, This is optional, you two don't have to go on dates to go out. If you're young make sure you have parental permission first. Ask him if he'd like to go swimming or do some other seasonal activity with you. A movie, though cliché, is always an option too. Find a time and day that works for the two of you and date away! If he indicates that he is not interested in you, leave him. There are many other boys out there!

, And friends are important!

Avoid being too affectionate, that would maybe scare the person. But don't be too casual, or else when you ask him, he might be shocked and so confused he might immediately disagree to the idea.;
, Be sure you both have the time to talk together. It wouldn't be an appropriate time to ask if the person is in a hurry. Then he might feel forced to give an answer without thinking about it. Also, don't make it too obvious or oblivious that you are going to ask them out, you don't want them to say no before you have asked or wonder why you ask.

, This is probably the hardest to do. What you should do is, just get it out. Ask, without being overly confident, but not too shy either. If you are to confident and make reasons why, he might reject you.

, Well, good for you! Now, plan where and what you are going to do, and have a good time! And if you stay together, don't cheat!

, Move on. Maybe try again after a good time (a couple of weeks) if you feel like it. Don't be mad, and if the person doesn't explain the motive, then don't ask. Don't seem desperate, just let it go, and be happy.

Have a life outside of Facebook.,

Keep your posts short and pithy.,
Compliment people.,
Don't be nosy.,
Don't rush to answer everything.,

Realize that just because you care about a cause or game, you don't have a right to intimidate people with it.,
Quit whining and complaining.,
Don't turn comments or messages into things they're not.,
Be friendly, relaxed and true to yourself.",How to Be Cool on Facebook," Facebook is a way to keep others in your life, not a way to create a life, so go out and have yours, in full dimension. Facebook isn't proof that you have friends––friends need real life interaction, not stacking up in a list. Checking your Facebook and keeping your profile up to date are one thing, so don't spend all your time on what should be a tool you use wisely.;
, When talking to your friends using Facebook, avoid the dull details that you'd never share face to face. Knowing your daily movements (interpret that however you like) and your boredom quotient isn't fascinating to anyone and it's definitely not cool. Instead, look for ways to say interesting, different and quirky things that will cause your friends to want to read more. For example, if you discover a friend likes the same band as you, say something like: ""Hey I love (blah) too! Do you have their new album?"" and then go on to talk about how you were listening to their track when you accidentally dropped a wedding cake on your uncle's dog, or something equally unusual and funny. Seek always to inject good humor into your Facebook interactions. Be truthful if you can, but there is probably some link you can make with something weird that has happened to you and something on their profile.


Change your status about once every two days. Clear it when you haven't done anything interesting recently, rather than posting ""Kate has just eaten a sandwich"". Keep your post vague, so that all the mystery of your regular life is not revealed immediately.

, As a community member, you will be considered cool for participating regularly. However, the cool can veer into uncool all too easily if you overdo your participation and flood people with your messages. Too many messages will come across as overbearing or annoying and you might lose connections as a result.


Avoid posting unless you have something interesting to say. Regularity isn't an excuse for banality.

, Long posts are a bore and aren't what Facebook was intended for. Short and sweet will keep your Facebook reputation cool, allowing your friends to graze for the tidbits quickly. Keep your information to a few sentences maximum. If you feel the urge to say more, here are some good options:


Get yourself a blog. If you want to explore an issue in-depth over several pages, a blog is the place to be. Your followers will join because that's what they expect. On Facebook, nobody expects this!
Write a novel or an insightful editorial piece.
If you have something personal to say to a friend, then say it in person or via private message rather than expressing it openly on Facebook.

, Being cool is about focusing beyond yourself and recognizing the good others have done and said. Remember to ask others what they've been up to instead of assuming they care about what you've been up to. By asking people about themselves, you compliment them and they'll want to talk to you again. They'll see you as someone worth cultivating.

, Would you be nosy in real life? The bet is that you wouldn't be half as nosy as you might be tempted to be on Facebook where the social constraints seem less real and actionable. Instead, be constrained and don't go about delving for information in ways that seem pushy or suspicious. Above all, be discreet––post information about yourself and others that is fine for anyone to read; if it's not fit for public consumption, it's not fit for Facebook.


Don't leave comments asking people about their status updates and relationship status changes unless you know them very well. Even then, keep any comment short and avoid making assumptions. What they're saying may well be very different from what you're understanding. If you really must know what's going on, ask them privately.

, Facebook isn't ping pong. You don't need to volley back every post, question or comment. Some things don't need to be commented on at all. Others could probably do with no more than a brief acknowledgement, such as ""OK"" or ""Sounds great"", and you can even go as far as to simply like their last comment and leave it at that. Also, slow down your pace when you do respond. For example, if someone invites you to an event, don't respond yes or no right away. Go with ""Maybe"" and take your time even answering that way. From a coolness factor, answering yes too fast might seem too available or desperate; from a practical factor, it's lovely to have wriggle room when you realize you really can't be bothered participating later.


Wait a few minutes before answering any person's first post, maybe 4 or 5, longer even if you have something else to do (you do have something else to do, right?). However, don't ignore the person when it's clear you're online––leaving a response hanging for 20 minutes is just rude and shows a lack of respect or care for the person. Think how you'd feel and gauge your responsiveness accordingly.

, Think about posts before you write them, and wait two minutes between reading and posting a message, update or reply. Spell properly (there is nothing to be gained by being a sloppy speller), with the exception of recognized and accepted shortcuts (such as LOL and BTW). Keeping it casual is fine but misprinting words just because you can't be bothered to check the spelling isn't cool. Do you want to come across as informed? Then write well.


Use occasional emoticons. Smileys are nice, as long as you don't use them in every post or stack them up with exclamation marks and crazy comments.

, Much of what we mean comes from our careful (or not-so-careful) choice of words.


Use line break, commas and periods (full stops) to help people understand what you're saying. Also, use normal capitalization––avoid typing everything in uppercase as it isn't appropriate either from a grammar point of view or an etiquette one (it's considered to represent shouting in the online environment and even if you already know that, if you've forgotten, then remind yourself).
State facts, don't gossip. Obscure references to things you've overheard or misread can spark chains of online rumors. Don't let things like that get out of hand. Always check your facts before making bold assertions or statements.
Don't write anything vulgar or sexually oriented. On the whole, most people have such a diverse range of friends that you need to be mindful of a broad audience. If you want to be crass, go to IM with your equally good humored crass-minded friend and get it off your chest in private. When in public view, relax and show you're a normal person everyone feels comfortable talking to.

, Unfortunately, some rather uncool behavior has appeared on Facebook when it comes to promoting a cause or personal excitement about Facebook linked games. And some people think it's okay to shove their cause in the faces of their friends on a regular basis, winding up to a belting crescendo that guilt people into signing petitions or sending on messages on behalf of the cause or their new initiative. This isn't anywhere near cool––it's invasive and it's exhausting. You'll lose friends if you overdo your passion for anything. Other things to be careful with include:


If you have a few applications that you like, that's great. But don't invite all your friends to do hundreds of quizzes and then clog up your profile with 17 different ""Are you snap, crackle or pop?"" questionnaires. It grows tiresome very quickly and leaves the impression that you're stuck in Facebook.
Don't send bumper stickers more than once a week.
Who cares if your virtual crops are increasing, your virtual home has had a redesign, or you've become a virtual millionaire on some game? Keep updates about game exploits to an absolute minimum or you risk boring your friends to death.

, Gripes are irksome on Facebook. Do you like reading people's distress and down moments on your news feed? Then take it as read that few other people do either. It's really not cool to use Facebook as a grievance forum. There are far more constructive and caring places to deal with personal problems than Facebook.


Equally important is not assuming that people on Facebook will agree with everything you say. If you're opinionated, Facebook really isn't the place to air your fierce opinions. Get yourself a good blog for that part of your creative urge.

, Stressing over someone sending you 5 X's instead of the usual 6 is a sign of being hooked online too long. Nowadays nobody takes the X's seriously––they're bandied about by everyone and they don't mean that that person wants to start dating you all of a sudden. Treat everything casually and kindly, and if you're not sure what someone is saying for real, don't be shy to ask them in private what's going on but be careful not to overplay your interpretation. Ultimately, assume the best of everyone and realize that if someone gets a little challenging toward you online, not to add fuel to their fire and to acknowledge that perhaps that person has been spending just a little too much time on Facebook. You don't have to stoop to their level!


This extends to not assuming that people you meet on Facebook only are your real friends. They may be total fakes you're interacting with, people who pretend to be someone they're not.

, If you don't feel this trio of self-empowerment, turn off the social media connection until your mojo is restored––often a good sleep or an afternoon off will do the trick. Coolness wears off quickly when you're snappy, irritable and clearly self-absorbed on Facebook.

Not only will your name pop up with each like or comment, but Facebook's algorithms will deem the rest of your activity more important, thus adding it to your friends' newsfeeds.Ever heard of ""S4S"" on YouTube? It means Sub-For-Sub: You subscribe to them, and they'll subscribe to you. It's similar on Facebook--if you like people's pictures, they'll feel more inclined to like yours, too. Think of it as an unwritten contract.;
, Share content from others (friends or your favorite funny/political website) that you find interesting; odds are, your friends will like it as well. Most outside websites now allow sharing directly.


Share your pictures. If you post a picture, the only people who will see it will be the people online at that time. When you share it later, a whole new audience will notice it.

, You don't have to come up with your own jokes. Simply putting a spin on what's already out there is just as effective.


Be timely. A great joke at 4 AM will only be appreciated by insomniacs and those on the other side of the globe.
Stay current. Humor comes and goes in trends (think hashtags). Use what's going on at the moment to reach more people.

Consider your audience. While you may think your stubbed toe is big news, others may not.
Some things are timeless. People will always love babies.



, When others do comment and like your posts, respond! Engaging your friends will lead to more exchanges, laughs, and likes.

, Unless it's something remarkable, avoid posting it. Pictures of your dinner can go on your blog. Your three-legged, talking cat, however? Post away!


Think about whether or not the post is literally something others might like. If it isn't, don't post it. It won't get the reaction you're aiming for.

, Unless you're starting a business and want to fool the masses, there is no reason to do this. Anything that doesn't warrant a true fan of your content just isn't worth it and won't last. Having robots like your page won't make real humans feel similarly.

Try not to send many (if any) application invites to your Facebook friends.,
Try to personally create replies to all friends' messages they post to you, or by clicking ""Like"", they'll see that you have seen the message and may get back to you soon.

,
Limit how many Facebook chat sessions to a person you have in a day.,
Calm down when sending app invites.",How to Have Good Facebook Etiquette," Even if your response was to ignore the request/delete the request, you might as well tell the person why you did so. Be careful, as accepting a request that should have been ignored, can cause massive confusion, as the Facebook notification light will be triggered, when they see you have accepted it.;
, And if you send it where only your friend can see it, it may seem to become degrading on the person's morale.

, If not out of consideration for their feelings, then at least out of consideration for a potentially awkward run-in with them in the future, don't just remove them.

, If both parties want, you may communicate with them and tell them about the service and they might set it up themselves.

,, Just because one of your friends on Facebook says that they are online, doesn't mean that they have to always stare at your (and only your) chat message. Yes, some software pieces can now help you in holding Facebook chats, but for those who still don't have these software pieces, cool your jets for how many messages you send per day.


Just because you might find it flattering to post a picture in one way, doesn't mean your friends will mind either, if they, in the same pose had a negative experience and weren't that flattering.

, Just because you think something is cool (if you are about to post a status update to your friends), doesn't mean that they'll like you any more if you send them an additional invite (unless they specifically ask you to).

Refrain from making those ""you've been hacked"" statuses.,

Avoid sharing pictures on your newsfeed that beg for likes.",How to Avoid Being Annoying on Facebook," If you have something to say, like ""Oh you screwed up my life, you're such a horrible person (insert slew of curse words and the rest of your paragraph here), just think. Does the rest of Facebook want to see this? Most of the people on your friends list aren't even your real friends, so why would you want them knowing your business? And why would you post a status sounding like you're directing it at one person when obviously you just want attention? Do everyone on your Facebook list a favor and send that message to the person who deserves it.;
, You know him from school but you haven't seen him for a few years but he won't leave you alone. It's fine to write the casual ""Hey what's up?"" to someone once in a while, but what's the point of starting a bunch of pointless conversations with someone? If you're trying to make friends with them, ask if you can hang out in person some time. Otherwise, leave them alone.

, There are two sides to the spectrum: annoying and distant. If you go on Facebook every day but hardly ever message people back, what's the point of having a Facebook? If you think you're ""too cool"" to ever be available then you're not. You're just annoying people.

, Selfies are great... to an extent. Until you start posting them every day. Your friends can all tell you're incredibly attractive and have probably already bowed down and worshipped you with ten likes. That's enough––any more and you'll be unfriended.

, No one cares about what you're eating, it's hard enough keeping up with one's own meals, let alone anyone else's.

, Why not just say something silly instead of saying ""you've been hacked?"" Hacking requires skill. Going on your friend's already logged-in Facebook isn't skilled. Equally, stop excusing silly statements by claiming ""I've been hacked"". Own up to your slip-ups and don't repeat them.

, Here's an example:


Day one – Person 1: Hey. Person 2: Sup? Person 1: Chilling, listening to music Person 2: Cool
Day two – Person 1: Hi! Person 2: Hey. Person 1: What's up? Person 2: Nm, you? Person 1: Listening to music
Day three – Person 1: Hey what's up? Person 2: Thinking of going for a walk soon.. you? Person 1: About to take a shower Person 2: K...

, Just don't do it. Sharing a picture of a kid with cancer sadly won't do that kid any good and it won't cure him. It will just make people sad. And just because you don't share it doesn't mean you're a horrible person; it's really not that different from forcing people to pass on chain letters for fear of something bad happening––it's peer pressured guilt and fear and that's not much fun for anyone. If that child's illness really grabs you, donate or go and visit the kid, then you've got a genuine story to share.

Track your usage for a day (or a week).,
Think about the things you can do with this time instead.,
Try to remember your life without Facebook.,
Think of how you can get the benefits of Facebook without it.",How to Quit Facebook1," Keep tabs of what you actually do on Facebook. After every session, ask yourself, ""What did I just accomplish by checking Facebook?"" Odds are, you're probably just logging in to see if you've been poked, check for updates, write a new note, add a song, and other mindless tasks you do to waste time — even if you logged in for a set purpose, like accepting a friend request.


Recording your Facebook activities can help you realize how much time you actually spend getting nothing constructive done.
Mark the time when you log in and when you log out or download an app for your browser that will track how much time you spend on various sites.;
, If you find yourself spending, say, 10 hours a week on Facebook, make a list of all the other things you could accomplish in that time. Seeing this number of hours written down can make you feel the harsh reality that you're wasting your life away on Facebook. Here are some things you could do instead:


Pick up a part-time job and save up (or even invest) that money.
Teach your kid (or kid sibling) how to throw a football.

Get fit.
Spend time socializing with people in your real life.

Clean your room.

Volunteer.

Read a book.

Teach yourself a new language.

Make a Papasan chair cushion.
Listen to music and make it a routine. An album per day or so.

, If you only joined Facebook a year or two ago, or if you got through all of high school and college before Facebook was even introduced, try to think about all of the things you did before Facebook. Maybe you spent less time in front of the computer in general and more time outside. Make a list of all of the positive aspects of your life without Facebook to motivate yourself. Here are some ways that your Facebook-free life could have been like:


Maybe you spent less time stalking your exes, caring what your photos look like, or comparing yourself to all of the ""friends"" you haven't seen in five years.
Maybe you spent more time playing soccer or tennis with your friends.
Maybe you spent more time actually interacting with people in person instead of just checking up on them online.
Writing down all of the positive things in your life before Facebook will make you see that you don't really need Facebook to be happy. In fact, if you have an addiction, it's likely that it's making you depressed.

, Write down all of the things that Facebook has done for you, and the things that you'll miss the most when you delete your account. Then, think of a way that you can still get these benefits without feeling the soul-crushing feeling of being chained to your Facebook account. Here are some ways to do it:


Some people say that they're only on Facebook to remember their friends' birthdays. Well, if that's one of your reasons for being on it, mark a calendar up with all of the birthdays of your actual friends so you don't forget them, or just write them down on a piece of paper you hang up on your desk. You could also create a birthday chart that is organized by month.
Some people are on Facebook because they love sharing photos. Instead of using Facebook, you can share your photos by starting an Instagram account and only connecting with the friends and family members that you'd really like to share with.
Some people are on Facebook because they want to know what their friends are up to. Instead of being on Facebook to check up on your five closest far-flung Facebook friends, make a goal of calling them or emailing them once a week or once a month to see what they've been up to.
Some people go on Facebook to have the feeling of a social interaction when they're feeling lonely at work, or when they're stuck at home or too busy to hang out with people. Instead of interacting with people online, grab lunch with a coworker at lunch, or get your work done earlier so you can go home and hang out with your friends.
Some people like Facebook because they like to see the articles that people are posting and commenting on. Try checking a popular news source instead of Facebook to gain more knowledge and still be in the loop. Some of the sites that people post from the most are The Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, Jezebel, Slate, The New York Times, Gawker, College Humor, and The Onion. Pick a new -- and more informative -- website to read instead of Facebook.

"
Turn off all of your email and phone Facebook notifications.,
Save your important contacts.,
Try to quit for a short period of time.,
Make an announcement that you're quitting for good.,
Leave Facebook.,
Block Facebook from your computer (optional).,
Find alternatives to using Facebook.",How to Quit Facebook2," Part of the reason you're on Facebook is because every time you check your phone or email, you get a notification that someone posted a photo or a comment about you, or that it's the birthday of your third cousin's second best friend. This kind of message inevitably causes you to click on Facebook for ""the purpose"" of seeing whatever has been posted, but it leads you to inevitably waste your time browsing through random photos.


Turning off the notifications is the first step to making Facebook less appealing.
To do this, click on the lock, press ""See More Settings"", find the Email tab, press Edit, and select ""Only notifications about your account, security and privacy"".

, Before you delete Facebook, you should keep the contact information of the people you actually want to stay in touch with if you don't have them already. Save them to your email account so that you can continue to stay in touch with the people you really care about. If your only interaction with someone was through sending Facebook messages, then chances are that it wasn't a real friend anyway.

, Just like smoking, quitting cold turkey will be the hardest approach. Instead, try quitting Facebook for a day or two, and then work your way up to quitting it for a week. During that time, make a list of all of the things you accomplished because you didn't waste your time on Facebook. Set more goals to meet for your next week without Facebook and try to meet them.


Once you've been able to go two or three weeks without Facebook, you should work your way up to a month. After that, it may be time to quit for good.
If you're staying on Facebook because you're worried you'll miss important updates from friends or that you won't get invited to parties, have a close friend in your inner circle keep you in the loop about what's going on with your friends without talking about how great Facebook is.
Alternately, you can tell your friends to stop talking about what people are doing on Facebook completely instead. Remind yourself that if your ""friends"" had something really important to tell you, they would just call you or tell you in person -- not post it on Facebook.

, Write a simple post telling all of your friends that you're quitting Facebook for a while. This will give them a nice heads up if they're used to connecting with you on Facebook, and it will also make you more likely to keep your promise. Once you announce that you're really quitting Facebook, you'll be more likely to stick to your promise.


If you're really serious, tell your friends to not tease you for not being on Facebook, and to stop telling you that you need to give in and get back on Facebook.

, Once you've announced that you left Facebook, it's time to take measures to actually leave it, and to tie up any loose online threads that you've left behind. Here are some things that you may need to do:


There are two options here: you can either deactivate your account, which lets you take a breather without losing any information, or permanently delete your Facebook account, which is the real deal.
If you've started any groups, transfer admin rights to someone you trust.
Send an email to your Facebook contacts explaining your decision to leave. Include your current contact information so they can get in touch with you without Facebook.
If you plan to permanently delete, clear every last bit of information from your profile. Don't forget to remove your photos!

, You can turn to this step in a moment of desperation if you're worried you won't be able to control your impulse to go on Facebook -- even after you deleted your account. Check out How to How to Block Websites on Firefox or How to Block a Website on Internet Explorer for assistance.


You can use free ""self-control"" programs, available for download online, to temporarily disable your access to popular social media websites.
Parental control programs can also help; various ones are available and allow you to set limits on who can access Facebook (or other sites) and for how long.

, A lot of people get addicted to Facebook because they check it when there's nothing else to do, like in between classes or during a lunch break; then the curiosity spills over into time that should be spent doing other things, like studying or working. Find something to do during those little windows of time in order to prevent relapse. Here are some great ways to fill your time instead of being on Facebook:


Stay away from the computer as much as you can. For many of us, getting in front of a monitor is a default activity. Try to find other things to do that'll keep you away from the computer and therefore, Facebook. Keep a notebook. Meditate. Finger knit.
Learn to do impressive tricks with a tech deck.
Make a goal of reading one book a week instead of spending that time on Facebook.
Call your friends on the phone or do something fun with them in-person. Anything that you can do anywhere and for short periods of time is good.

Transfer ownership and admin rights.",How to Make a New Facebook Account3," Having a copy of all your information—from our profile info to your friend's list and photos—is never a bad thing to have as a backup. To do this:


Click the account menu icon (white triangle) at the top right of any Facebook page.
Choose Account Settings

Click on Download a copy of your Facebook data
Click Start My Archive

This will take a while, especially if you have a lot of photos and are active on Facebook.

, When your archive is complete, empty out all fields that aren't required, and delete. For required fields, use names that are clearly fake (Frondheim Dingleschmidt) or hopelessly general (John Smith).


If you want to reuse your phone and email information in the new account, change those to something meaningless before you begin the deletion process. Facebook will not let you have multiple accounts with the same information.

, To delete your primary email account, you must first create a new one—Facebook will verify the email address, so you can't just make one up.


Create a new browser tab (Control-T on a PC, Command-T on a Mac).
Go to a free email provider, such as Google or Yahoo
Create a new account. It can be a normal email account that you might want to use for real at some point, or a temporary one you will use once and trash. One advantage of an alternate email account is that you can use it for all spam-generating sites—you never have to check it, so anything that is in it will always be spam!

, In your soon-to-be-defunct Facebook account, go to General Account Settings, edit the email settings, and click on Add another email.


Enter your new email address, and your password, and click Save Changes.
You will be sent a confirmation email to your new email address. Be sure you accept the new email. You will be returned to Facebook's account settings page, where you can now make the new email the primary.
Click the Primary email: button next to the new email address, enter your password, and click Save Changes. This will close the edit window for your email. Re-open it, and you will see your new email address on top, as the primary email. To the right of your old (real) email address, it will say Remove. Click that, and your old email is cleared out.

""Show my full birthday on my timeline."" This is the most common option for younger people.
""Show only month & day of my birth on my timeline."" This is a helpful option if you don't want people knowing exactly how young or old you are.
""Don't show my birthday on my timeline."" This is a great option if you're tired of getting hundreds of wall posts from people you barely know on your birthday.

",How to Edit Personal Information on Facebook," Upon opening, you'll be taken to your news feed, no matter which version of profile you use.

,,, This should take you to the page that contains all your displayable account information.

, You can select from many options, which include Work and Education, Living (hometown, current city), Basic information (birthdate, address, religious views, political views, etc.), an About Me section (favorite quote, or something to identify what makes you, you), a separate Contact Information section (containing contact information and alternate website contact data) and a box known as Favorite Quote. There’s even a place to fill in how you know other relatives who exist on Facebook from this page.

,,;

,,, You might have to scroll down a bit, to find it. Click the “Edit” button at the top right of this box.

, Type into the box your current city, and if it doesn’t come up by the end, your state. Only use map-cities.

It will accept almost any city/state that is located globally too, but it may take a bit more typing, with the provinces and such. So be forewarned.

Decide what community you would like to develop or promote.,
Create a Facebook group for market research.,
Sponsor your group on Facebook.,
Build buzz for new products by hinting at them through a Facebook group.,
Create a Facebook group to promote a profession or region.",How to Use a Facebook Group as a Promotional Tool," Unlike the Facebook business (Fan) pages, groups are designed to highlight the members, promote discussion and create opportunities for networking. Even if you are a business, you can create a community of people based on your business and services, and the following are some ideas for companies, bloggers and professionals:


Create a Facebook group of referrals for your business. If someone is very excited about the service you have provided, ask them if they would be interested in being part of your ""Company Name Review Community."" Become the administrator, decide if you want it to be public or by invitation only and then invite your past customers and new customers to interact.
Create a Facebook group around a product. Be careful not to announce the product through a Facebook group, as this is against Facebook's 2011 updated promotional rules. However, after a product has been released, create a community where people can talk about uses for the product or stories of when they used it. For example, if your company makes cooking utensils, invite people to share their favourite recipes through a Facebook group, and announce this option on your website, in ads and in emails.
Create a Facebook discussion group for your blog, library, book store, club, magazine and more. Creating a Facebook group around 1 subject, such as a book, an important test, an article, a craft or a club will allow you to move past the ""comments"" section of a blog, website or Facebook wall. People who are interested will join the group and it can be a more intimate setting than just leaving a comment and an email address under a blog.;
, Use your personal or fan page to invite people who like your product or service to be part of a community, and you will ultimately network with your target audience. Communicate with your group daily, and ask them opinions on what changes they would like to see.


Gather demographic information about the people who join your group. After seeing who is interested in interacting with your product or identifying themselves with it, you can create a Facebook Ad on through your Fan page that targets the same demographic.

, Look at your group's home page options. Purchase a link with your credit card. This link will host ad content and message boards.


Once you create a Facebook group, you become the ""Admin"" who can assign other administrators and approve content and members.

, Although you are not allowed to hold contests on Facebook, you can promote some exclusive information for your members. Discuss sales, opinions and favourite products.

, This is a great way to create buzz around yourself as a professional. Choose a catchy name and target friends who share the same interests.


After a while, you may find friends of friends asking to join your group. Sometimes, creating a private group creates a buzz and a desire to join. For professional networking, you want to create a semi-exclusive club. For example, you can create a group of ""Boise Marketing Professionals,"" that can discuss industry information and network.
Use your Facebook group to go the extra step in marketing. Create regular in-person meetings, book clubs and meetings at large industry events. You cannot create a Facebook event using a group page, but you can create one by discussing it on your group discussion board.

To add to Favorites, just click the green “Add to Favorites” button or, if you want to opt out, click “Skip.”

, This is the last step in setting up your organization’s Facebook page. Here, enter the locations you’re targeting (e.g., your hometown, a certain city, a postal code, and so on) in the first field.


Set an age restriction if your organization is targeting certain age markets (e.g., for young adults, you might want to restrict the page for ages 18 to 25).

, If the organization is specifically for a certain gender (e.g., men’s golf club or women’s latest fashion trends), you can set it next to the Gender option. You can set to “All,” “Men,” or “Women.”

, If your organization is targeting a particular interest (e.g., a cause for animal abuse or an organization for checkers players), you can add this information in the last text box.

, When all is done, click the “Done.” You will be taken back to your personal account’s News Feed. To access the Facebook page as an admin, just click the link on the Favorites section on the left panel (if you opted to put it there), or click the upside down triangle at the top header, and select “Use Facebook as .”

"
Know why it is important to spot a fake account.,
Think twice about accepting friend requests from people you don't know or who haven't been connected to you through legitimate, verifiable means.,
Read the profile carefully.,
Check out their friends.,
Be alert to anyone new that you've friended but don't really know.,
Beware interconnected faking.,
Look for and record inconsistencies in the things they say to you.,
Do a double take if the person says anything weird or ""out-of-character"".,
Be really wary of undying declarations of love, affection, and romance.,
Unfriend this person if you're suspicious, unsure, or uncomfortable with having them as part of your Facebook friends.",How to Spot a Fake Facebook Account," If you're wondering what can happen to you from having a fake friend on Facebook, there are quite a few things that can cause you distress and loss from being involved with a con artist (which a Facebook faker usually is). For example, you could be manipulated into believing someone really cares about you when all they want is to play mind games for their own satisfaction or to get money, goods, property, or something else from you. The impostor might also be setting you up to steal your identity or valuable information from you that they can use to manipulate someone else.;
, If you're not sure, consider the following:


Ask them questions: What makes you want to be my friend? How did you find out about me? Who do we know in common (you can then check)?
Look at their profile photo. Is it way too perfect or does it seem touched up in any way? Maybe you've seen it before?
Search their name online to see if it returns. This won't be so useful if the name is a common one but for a more unusual one, there might be some interesting returns.
Have they being tagged? A real person is generally tagged here and there as part of the Facebook sharing experience.

, Does what is being said add up or are there some really hard-to-believe statements being made? For example, maybe there is a photo of a very young person next to claims of being a professor or a CEO. Does the embellishment seem more than the usual ""making oneself look good"" and come across as simply implausible? Trust your own senses on this one. You could even ask for proofs of some of the things the person has stated.

, Are their friends global or local? The more local the friends, the more likely the person is to be real. The more global their friendship list, with very few or no local friends, start getting suspicious. The lack of local friends suggests that this is not a real persona you're dealing with but a fake account.

, If you're in the (not-so-great) habit of accepting friend requests from friends of friends' friends or because they seem to have similar tastes to yours in music, cooking, dancing, or whatever, then you leave yourself open to the occasional fake. While you can make wonderful connections in this way, try to always have someone you do know vouch for this person first. And if that's not possible, be alert to signs of weird behavior, such as suddenly bombarding you with likes, comments, photos, etc. on a daily basis. If you hardly know this person, they should be taking things slowly and politely, not invading your space immediately.

, At one time it was probably reasonable to think that if someone had a group of friends interacting with them and vouching for each other, that that person must be real. However, there are increasing cases of one person running numerous fake Facebook accounts, pretending to be an array of different people, all vouching for one another and all trying to be friends with someone real! For example, the case of Natalia Burgess who wove a web of deceit and caused many young males to fall for her various aliases, all because she felt inadequately loved.Sadly, impostors of this sort go to incredible lengths to create an array of fake accounts including other social media accounts and websites to give the impression that their fake personas are ""real"".

, If you're being targeted by an elaborate web of lies, eventually these start to unravel. This is most evident in someone who is trying to maintain several fake Facebook accounts at once and eventually, they will drop the ball and mix up their stories. If you start noticing this in response to questions, or in their comments, take note and remain alert for more inconsistencies.

, For example, if an adult is pretending to be a teen, they may say something that dates them by referring to a historic event or person that teens wouldn't really know much about. Or they may prove to know way too much about a topic that someone they're claiming to be would not.

, If someone you've never met, who lives thousands of miles away from you, and who has barely revealed themselves gets amorous with you, be suspicious. Sometimes the faker does this because they love the feeling of playing with the life and feelings of someone else; sometimes it's because they're in love with online love but are too afraid to reveal their true selves (or they're in a relationship in real life); and other times it could be that they're after something, like money, sex, or drugs.


Question your own feelings and motivations if you start to feel something for a person who declares they love you online. Is it too sudden? Too weird? Too freaky? A little bit icky? Trust those feelings and delete this fake friend from your account.
If they ask you for sexy pictures, immediately be suspicious. A fake account is a good shill for getting free pornographic material that then gets passed around online.

, It's not like they're your real friends or family but they could cause you a lot of problems if they keep pretending to be someone they're not to a point where it harms you. Warn other friends of yours on Facebook if you know they have also friended the fake account; one of the tactics of an impostor is to befriend others in your circle of friends to try to make the friendship seem more ""real"".but why make a fake profile ?

, Nicely. Once you find the profile, send them a message stating who you are and your purpose. Tell them to take your pictures off the profile, or you will report them to the admin of the site.

, If they refuse to take the profile down, contact Facebook support directly via email. On most sites, there is a ""Report this Person"" button, or something similar.

, Try to make it as high quality as possible, and don't post it, because the impersonator could easily steal it. Instead, send the pic to an admin address.

Keep trying.",How to Find Friends from High School on Facebook," First, run a basic Facebook search for the name of the friend that you wish to find. Type the name in the ""Search Facebook"" search bar at the top of the page. Make sure that you type in both their first and last name.;
, Unless your high school friend has a very unique name, it's likely that they won't be the only person with their name on Facebook. Take some time to search through all of the people. Click on the profile picture ""thumbnail"" photos to figure out which profile belongs to your friend. They will likely have a photo of themselves on their profile.


If you can't find a profile picture that looks like your old friend, chances are you either don't recognize them or they have a different sort of profile picture on Facebook. Some people choose to make their profile picture a photo of animals, cars, cartoon characters, and other things they like.
If you can't tell, try clicking on some of the people's Facebook profiles. While much of the information on their profile will probably be hidden, since you haven't ""friended"" them – you may be able to uncover enough information to recognize the person you're looking for.

, If you can't find the person right away, you'll need to get creative. Think about what you know about this person. Search their name again – but this time include their middle name, or enter a nickname that they went by. Some people go by a different name entirely on Facebook. If they have ever voiced wishes about having another name, they may have decided to go by that name on Facebook. If your search results look promising, scroll through the resulting profiles and try to find your friend.

, Perhaps one of your other Facebook friends is already friends with this person. Click on one of your Facebook friends' profiles. Then, if you scroll down a bit and look at the second box on the left of their profile, you'll find their list of friends. Click on that to access their full list of friends, and scroll through the list. Look for someone who might be the friend you want to find.


If you find someone and think it may be them, but you aren't sure, consider sending them a friend request anyways. Otherwise, send your Facebook friend a quick message asking if the person on their ""Friends"" list is the person you are looking for.

, This service may make your search less tedious if you have friends in common with the high school friend, or if you are trying to find multiple friends. This button is at the top of Facebook, next to the ""Friend Requests"" symbol and the button that says ""Home"". Pressing on this will show you a list of people you may know because both of you have mutual friends. Scroll through this list for a while to see if the person you're looking for pops up.

, They may immediately know who you're talking about and be able to send you the link to the person's profile so you can friend them. To save you time, and to prevent seeming desperate, only ask a few Facebook friends who you think may know this person. Don't go through your entire Facebook friend list and ask them about the person you're looking for.

, Once you find the person, click ""Add Friend"" to send them a friend request! First, click on their name, which will send you to their Facebook profile. At the bottom right of their cover photo, you should see three buttons: one that says ""Add Friend"", one that says ""Message"" and one that is simply three dots. Click on the one that says ""Add Friend"", and wait for them to accept your friend request. Facebook will send you a notification when this happens.

, If you've been waiting for a few weeks, and they don't accept the request, don't take it too harshly! If you really want to be their Facebook friend, perhaps go to their profile again and press on the ""Message"" button. They might not recognize you, so simply reminding them that you two used to be friends in high school might be a good idea. Be warned that some people choose to only let certain people (such as Facebook friends) message them, so this might not work for everyone.

Please note that this method will only work for Page invites; you'll have to stick to a manual method to add friends to a Group.

, Depending on which browser you're using, your process for doing so will vary:


Chrome/Firefox - Hold Ctrl + ⇧ Shift and tap J (⌘ Command + ⌥ Option + J on Mac).Safari - Hold ⌥ Option + ⌘ Command and tap C. if this doesn't work, you'll need to enable the console from Safari's ""Preference"" tab (top left corner of your screen). Click the ""Advanced"" tab, then click the box next to ""Show Develop menu..."".Opera - Hold Ctrl + ⇧ Shift and tap I, then click the ""Console"" option at the top right corner of the pop-up menu.

, The console entry field should be at the bottom of your screen.The code is as follows: javascript:var inputs = document.getElementsByClassName(‘uiButton _1sm’); for(var i=0; i<inputs.length;i++) { inputs.click(); }

If your code doesn't work, try this rendition: javascript:var inputs = document.getElementsByClassName('_1pu2'); for(var i=0;i<inputs.length;i++) { inputs.click(); }

If you're using Google Chrome, you can enter this code into your browser URL at the top of the page. You may need to re-type the ""javascript:"" part first, since the Chrome URL bar might automatically delete it.

, This should begin inviting your friends. The process may take a few minutes to complete.


The JavaScript code has an upper limit of 500 invites, so you may have to repeat this process multiple times if you have more than 500 friends. Doing so will increase the risk of being blocked from inviting more friends by Facebook.

, On Facebook, you might want to interact by making friends, liking pages, joining groups, or installing third-party apps. It’s fun to do, but always be careful when doing so.


You should not accept any friend requests of people whom you do not know personally.
Never engage yourself with unfamiliar and unusual pages or groups. Try to check the group’s “About” section and the number of your friends connected to the group before joining. If you are unfamiliar with the group, or if your friends are not group members, you should avoid that group.
Beware of installing unknown third-party apps on your user account as these may steal your login information. Always review the permission options of third-party apps carefully. If an app requires too much information and extra administration power during installation, do not install the app.
You must be careful about these engagements to prevent cyber-bullying and identity theft.

To block a person, visit the person’s profile page and click the gear icon at the bottom right of the cover image. In the menu that appears, click “Block” and follow the on-screen instructions. Once blocked, that person can no longer view your profile.


If worst comes to worst, save any evidence of cyber bullying and report the abuse to abuse@Facebook.com. The Facebook team will review the reported contents and take action.

, There are many well-known antivirus softwares in the market, such as AVG, Norton, Kaspersky, or BitDefender that can protect both your PC and monitor your online activities, especially on Facebook. You can also use some social media monitoring services and tools, such as How Sociable, Hoot suite, Cyber Alert, Quintly, and Soft Activity to keep yourself safe from any predators, cyber-bullies, and reputation issues.

, Problematic privacy issues and cyber bullying may go out of control sometimes. If you get yourself in such conditions, it may be best to close your Facebook account.


To close your Facebook account, go to the Settings page and click “Security” at the top left corner, under the General tab.
Click “Deactivate your account” at the bottom left corner, and a new page on account deactivation will load. Click on a radio button to choose a reason for deactivation, and edit other available managing options related to your account.

Know how to spot a scam.",How to Protect Your Facebook Account from Hackers," Avoid including your name, birthdate, pets, or common words in your password: make it difficult to guess.A strong password will be at least 8 characters in length, but the more the better. The longer (more characters) your password is, the more time it will take the hacker to crack it.A strong password should contain at least one of each of the following characters: lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers, and special characters.;
, Ensure that you create a different password for every web service/website you use.It’s not enough to do the same password with different numbers (eg., password1, password2 …).If you’re feeling uncreative and have difficulty thinking up new passwords, use an online password generator — just make sure it’s from a trustworthy source.

, As you create more strong and unique passwords, it will likely be difficult to remember them all. There are many good password managers available that will encrypt and safely store your passwords.


You might even have a password manager built into your operating system — for example, Mac users have the keychain password manager available to them for free.
If you don’t want to use a password manager, use a passphrase, for example: “I like big butts and I cannot lie!” might become iLbBaIcL!, This goes for all of your passwords — not just your Facebook one. If you find it difficult to remember to do this, set a reminder on your calendar., In fact, don’t share any of your passwords with anyone!

, This is particularly important if you are not using your own computer. When the “remember password” prompt comes up and you are not at your own computer, click on the “not now” button.


If you have set a master password for your browser, you can use the “remember password” function, as having a master password will prompt anyone trying to see your passwords to enter another password (one created by you) just to show the passwords.

Whether your browser automatically saves your passwords in a master password-protected file will depend on your operating system and your browser. You can ensure that a master password is in effect by checking the your browser preferences.



, If you are using a computer that you don’t know or trust, avoid doing anything that requires you to enter your password. Hackers commonly use keystroke loggers on computer systems that record everything you type, including passwords.If it’s not possible for you to avoid typing a password into a computer you don’t trust, change your password as soon as you can once you’re back at your own computer.

, On the Facebook home page, enter your email address and password to log into your Facebook account. Ensure that you log into Facebook (and other sites) at the correct address: www.facebook.com.

, Login Approvals gives your account an extra level of security by requesting a security code when you log in from an unknown browser. To set up Login Approvals, click on the word “Edit” to the right of “Login Approvals,” then click on “Get Started” to begin the setup wizard.


The most common way to access login codes is through your phone — either by text message or the Facebook app.
If you anticipate that you might need login codes when you do not have your phone nearby, you can get 10 codes ahead of time (which you can print off or write down, etc.) from Facebook. To do this, open the “Login Approvals” section, click on “Get codes,” enter your Facebook password, and click “Submit.”, Your “Trusted Contacts” are friends that Facebook enables to securely help you if you ever have trouble accessing your account. To add Trusted Contacts, click on “Edit” to the right of “Trusted Contacts,” then click on the words “Choose trusted contacts” (in blue). This will open a new window. Click on the “Choose Trusted Contacts” button to continue, enter your Facebook friends’ names into the text box, and hit “Confirm.”

, You should see apps (eg., Facebook for desktop, Messenger, Facebook for iPhone), access dates, and locations. If you see anything that doesn’t make sense, click on “End Activity” to the right of the session.


If you’ve had a security scare, consider clicking on “End All Activity” (at the top of the “See Where You’re Logged In” window) just to be extra safe.
This is also a great option if you’re unsure of whether you logged out after using Facebook on someone else’s computer. To end your session, simply access your Security Settings, and select See Where You’re Logged In, then scroll to the session in question and click on “End Activity” to close it remotely.

, Scammers can create fake accounts and friend people. Once they’ve friended you, they can spam your timeline, tag you in posts, send you malicious messages, and even target your friends.If your birthday and location are viewable by your Facebook friends, and you regularly update your whereabouts, scammers might be able to use your details and updates to crack your passwords or even break into your home when they know you’re away on vacation., Open your Privacy Settings by clicking on the “Privacy” tab in your “Settings” window. To the right of the tab you will see several options for adjusting your privacy, including “Who can see my stuff?” (set it to “Friends”); “Who can contact me?”; and “Who can look me up?”

, If you are unsure of what your profile looks like to someone who is not your friend, click on the lock icon in the upper right corner of your Facebook page (it’s to the left of the down-pointing triangle). This will open a “Privacy Checkup” drop-down menu. Click on “Who can see my stuff” and then “View as” to see your profile as others see it.


Each time you post a status update or photo, you can select your audience. You should see a button next to the “Post” button that says either “Friends,” “Public,” or “Custom.” If it says “Public,” this means that everyone will be able to see what you are about to post, regardless of whether you are friends. Ensure that it says “Friends” if it’s something you’d prefer to keep more private.

, Your friends aren’t immune to spam. If a friend posts a suspicious link or “shocking video” or sends something strange in a message, don’t trust that they’re doing it on purpose.

, If you make purchases on Facebook, be sure to review your purchase history regularly. That way, if someone does manage to get into your account and spend money, you can seek help from Facebook’s Payments Support Center.To review your payment history, go to “Settings” and then click on the “Payments” tab.

, How you report something will depend upon what you’re reporting.Note that you’ll need to be logged into your Facebook account.


To report a profile, go to the profile you want to report. In the bottom right of the cover photo, click on the ellipses (…) and select “Report.”
To report a post, click the down-pointing triangle in the top right of the post you want to report and select “I don’t want to see this,” then “Why don’t you want to see this?” to be brought to more specific options.
To report a message, open the message you'd like to report, click on the gear symbol in the top right of the message, and then click “Report Spam or Abuse.”

, This is particularly important if you’re using a computer at a library or Internet café, where many people who you do not know will use the computer throughout the day.


If you forget to log out, you can log out remotely by logging into Facebook, opening your security settings, and clicking on “See Where You’re Logged In.” If you’re still logged into a computer/device that isn’t yours, click on “End Activity,” and this will log you out., Anti-virus software helps keep your computer secure by preventing, detecting and removing malicious software. There are a number of free anti-virus programs available online (popular ones include AVG Antivirus and Sophos). If you don’t already have one, download one now, ensure that it’s kept up to date, and run scans regularly.


Both anti-virus and malware programs are more common for desktop computers and laptops than for mobile devices. Generally, apps and updates go through an anti-virus check on the end of the provider of your mobile operating system, so at this time anti-virus and malware apps are not considered to be necessary.

, Malware is able to get around Facebook’s security controls to access your account. From there, it can collect personal information, send status updates and messages that appear to be from you, or cover your account with ads that will crash your computer.There are a number of free anti-malware programs available online. Facebook offers several free scanners in its help pages.Your computer may have malware on it if you have recently tried to watch a “shocking video” via a Facebook post; if you have visited a website claiming to offer special Facebook features; or if you have downloaded a browser add-on that claims to do the impossible (for example, allowing you to change the color of your Facebook profile)., In particular, ensure that whatever browser you are using is up to date. Facebook supports Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer., This goes for sketchy looking websites, browser plug-ins and videos, and suspicious emails and notifications. If you ever receive an email asking for your password for any account that you have, do not respond. Reputable companies will never request your password over email.If a link looks suspicious, don’t click on it — even if it’s from someone you know. If one of your Facebook friends clicks on a spam link, they could accidentally send it over to you., If you suspect a phishing email, forward it to phish@fb.com.To avoid getting “phished” (scammed), beware of the following:Messages with poor grammar, spelling, and typos, as well as any strange fonts or spacing
Messages claiming to contain your password as an attachment
Images or messages with links that don’t match what you see in your status bar when you hover over them
Messages asking for your personal information such as your credit card info, driver’s license, social insurance number, date of birth, etc.
Messages claiming that your account will be deleted or locked unless you act immediately

Keep up with group updates.",How to Join Groups on Facebook," Groups allow people of similar interests to talk about those interests in a central place. You can find groups in several different ways, though the process to join is the same regardless.


Search for the group - If you know the name or part of the name of the group, you can search for it in the Facebook search bar. Select the group from the search results to open the group page. Please note that it is not an easy task as Facebook prioritize people and fanpages over the groups, so you need to be really specific.
Look at your friends' groups. Your friends' profiles will display the groups that they are members of. You can click the links to visit the group pages for any of these groups.
Browse suggested groups. Facebook recommends a list of groups based on your other interests and what your friends are subscribed to. You can seen this list by clicking the ""Find New Groups"" link in the left menu of the main page.;
, There are two main groups that you can find without being invited: ""Open"" groups and ""Closed"" groups. Open groups do not require approval to join and they can be joined immediately. Closed groups require approval from one of the group admins, and you will need to wait until you're accepted before you can view the group.


There are also ""Secret"" groups. These groups do not show up in searches or on people's profiles. You must receive an invitation from the group in order to join it.

, Open the group page that you want to join. You will see a ""Join Group"" button beneath the group's cover art. Click it to request admission to the group.


If the group is an Open group, clicking the ""Join Group"" button will enroll you in the group immediately.
If the group is a Closed group, clicking the ""Join Group"" button will send an admission request to the admins. You will need to wait until you are accepted before you can interact with the group.
Other people may be able to see that you've joined a group on their News Feed., While you can see the group posts before you are accepted, you cannot create posts or comment on other posts until your membership is accepted. Once it is, you can post and comment just as you would on other Facebook pages.


Just like a regular Facebook wall post, you can add images, videos, links and more to your group posts.
Make sure that your posts contribute to the group. If your posts are disrespectful or off-topic, you will likely be removed from the group.

, When you join a group, new posts will appear on your News Feed, meaning you don't always have to visit the group's page to stay informed. You can comment on posts that appear in your News Feed.

For certain pictures, you can also select certain friends that you do or do not want them to see.

, You can see the tagged pictures of you by going to your profile, click on ""Photos""- you should see ""Photos of You"" and the number of tagged pictures. Click on that, and look through the pictures. You should be able to un-tag any unappealing photos of you, but people still have the ability to see it. Don't hesitate for a second to ""un-tag"" yourself from pictures that you do not approve of. Simply click ""Report/Remove Tag"" under the ""Options"" on the bottom of the picture. Also if you think that the particular picture could put you in a compromising situation, consult whoever put it up and ask him or her to remove it immediately. If they are your so called pals they should comply with your request.

, This refers to pictures such as: Dancing-on-the-bar pictures or candid shots of the last time you got hammered with your pals on happy hour. Don't be caught with drugs, especially if you're underage because anyone can just print out the picture and show it to your parents or principal.

, Don't make your password something obvious such as your birthday or mother's maiden name. Try to have at least one capital letter, one lowercase letter, two numbers, and a symbol. The longer and more complicated the password, the safer you are from getting your account hacked. Always remember to log out after you're finished with Facebook, especially on a shared computer.

, The purpose of Facebook is to connect you with people you know. Making your profile public means you're sharing your information with everyone, even though you don't know them, a risk that you wouldn't want to take.

, Don't friend anyone out of your state/country unless you know them pretty well. Only friend people you know. You can add mutual friends that you don't know if you want to, though not recommended. Only friend people that you at least know their favorite color, siblings name, pets name, or something like that. Make sure they are the correct person by looking through their pictures. If they are not familiar, then remove them as a friend by getting to your friend list. Block anyone that seems to threaten or harass you.

, No matter how active you are, going through your children's posts, messages, photos, videos, comments is impossible. Remember: children have no right to privacy from their parents, but you don't necessarily need to view every post they make unless you have reason to be suspicious. You should have their passwords so you can see if they are getting into dangerous situations or are exhibiting inappropriate speech or behavior. You can, though, respect your children's individuality and take advantage of online Monitoring services. These services inform you on what you need to know in an easy to use platform. Some of these services offer monitoring for Facebook, Myspace, Twitter and cell phones; becoming your social shield against predators, Cyber-bullies, Reputation issues.

If you want to share photos with your friends through another method, you can post them on another online photo-sharing website, or email the photos.;
, Though you can adjust your privacy settings so that only friends can see your comments, if you really want to limit your Facebook profile exposure, you should send private messages directly to the people you want to communicate with. If you make a post that is visible to even a few people, or to your friends, they will be more likely to remember you and to look at your profile.

, If you want to limit your Facebook exposure, then you should avoid popping up on Facebook chat. Any of your Facebook friends will be able to see that you're online if you don't manage your settings, which means that any of your Facebook friends who are also online will be able to message you. Here's how to customize your settings on Facebook chat:


To turn off your chat completely, just click on the little gear at the bottom of the chat box to the right of your screen and select ""Turn off Chat.""

To appear offline to many of your Facebook friends, just click on the little gear at the bottom of the chat box to the right of your screen and select ""Advanced Settings."" Then, select the second option, ""Turn on chat for only some friends..."" and type a list of friends who will be able to see you online. You can also create a list of friends who can see you online and add the entire list to this column.

, If you post a lot of links or random thoughts from your everyday life, you will be raising your Facebook visibility. If you want to share your ideas with a few people, you can send a group message or send them by email. If you're posting on Facebook a lot, then your friends will be more aware of you and your profile.

, If you want to limit your Facebook profile exposure, then you shouldn't friend every person who sends you a request. Set ground rules for who you will accept as a friend, whether it's someone you actually know in person or someone you know well -- whatever your rule is, stick to it.


The amount of random friends you've accumulated over the years can really add up, which can lead to many people having access to your Facebook profile.
You can even go through a Facebook friends ""spring cleaning."" Go through all of your friends and unfriend anyone you haven't communicated with in the last year -- or the last few months. Only keep the people you want to communicate with on Facebook.

This will be harder for people to do if you change your name on Facebook. You can change it to something completely different, change it to your first and middle name instead of your first and last name, or even change it to a nickname that is known to only a few close friends. Here's how to do it:Click the gear in the upper-right corner of any Facebook page.

Click ""Edit"" on the far right next to the name setting.

You may have to open a new email address that you only use to get messages associated with your Facebook account for this purpose; you can also select an older email that you still use sometimes, such as an old school email. Here's how you do it:

, Tell your friends that you're serious about limiting your Facebook exposure. Even if you've set your privacy settings to high, talking to your friends can prevent them from trying to tag you in photos or posts, even if they don't succeed. Letting your friends know that you don't want a lot of Facebook exposure can also encourage them to avoid positing photos that include you in the picture, even if you aren't tagged.

, Whether you're listed as married to your significant other or jokingly in a relationship with your best friend, being in a Facebook relationship puts your name out there and lets the friends of the person who is in the relationship with you see your name, which will encourage them to want to see your profile.

, Anyone can see your Facebook picture, no matter what your settings are, so if you want to stay private and not let a person who stumbles across your picture know that it's really you, just pick a random photo of something else, like a sunset, and set it as your picture. That way strangers will be none the wiser.

, Anyone who finds you on Facebook will be able to see your cover photo as well as your profile picture, so you can also have a simple cover photo that doesn't reveal who you are and doesn't say much about who you are, either. This will keep random people from seeing who you are on Facebook.

, Limiting who can see where you work or where you went to school will keep people from stumbling across your profile if they search a certain company or school. To do this, simply click on your profile, and then click on ""Update Info"" on the top of your Facebook page. Your work and educational information will be listed on the left of the screen.

, Facebook's handy facial recognition software makes it so that your friends can upload photos, have Facebook recognize your face, and have you be automatically tagged in the photo.

Ask your friend if they restricted you.",How to Find Out if You Have Been Restricted on Facebook," If asking your friend point-blank about the issue isn't an option, visiting their Facebook profile is the next best thing.;
, This is usually indicative of a gap between private posts and public posts. If you've been restricted, you won't be able to see the private posts, hence the space here.Depending on when your friend made their public posts, you might not see a gap here even if you have been restricted.

, These will likely appear below the empty space if there is any. If there's a ""Public"" globe to the right of every post's timestamp, you know that you aren't seeing their private posts.


This doesn't necessarily mean they've restricted you--they may have simply decided to post only public items.

, Not being able to see photos or other content that you could before might mean you've been restricted.


It also might mean that your friend simply deleted their posts.

, Even if you can't see private posts or their old photos, your friend may have just deleted their old information and locked down their account to retain privacy from all of their Facebook friends (not just you). You can verify this by having a mutual friend look at your friend's Timeline and tell you if they see anything that you don't.


Even just asking them if your friend has posted recently when you can't see any account activity from the past month or so will accomplish this goal.

, There is always a possibility that the action was performed in error, since the ""Restricted"" list is in close proximity to the custom list section.

Make it less appealing!",How to Defeat a Facebook Addiction," While there is currently no such thing as a medically blessed diagnosable ""Facebook addiction"" or ""Facebook addiction disorder"" that a health or medical professional could categorically state you're suffering from, addictive behaviors have common threads that can lead to dysfunctional socializing and obsessive behaviors. The following signs indicate an unhealthy neediness for Facebook:

You wake up and the first thing you do is ""check Facebook"". And it's the last thing you do at night.
Nothing else thrills you or you feel ""empty"" without Facebook. All you want to do is spend time on Facebook, even to the exclusion of getting work done that needs to be done, or meeting family obligations. When not being on Facebook causes physical pain, sweats, illness and you're chomping at the leash to get back on it, your obsession has become an unhealthy one.
You're not able to go for more than a day without using Facebook. If forced to do so, you find yourself suffering from Facebook ""withdrawal"" symptoms, such as finding nothing else interesting, trying to find ways to get back to Facebook even if it means using a computer that is either out of bounds (for example, not yours), or difficult to get to, or you find yourself intensely worried about missing out on Facebook updates. These are all very unhealthy signs.
Even if you're not on Facebook constantly (indicating you need a reality check), checking it many times during the day is a sign of compulsive behavior. Spending more than an hour on Facebook a day will easily cut into all the other obligations you have in life and may cause social dysfunction problems.Your real life isn't going so well and Facebook presents a fantasy escape life where everything seems unencumbered, neat, happy, and easy – all things that are the opposite of your everyday life.
Adequate sleep ceases to be important to you.Instead, you're prepared to stay up way too late just to be able to accommodate your Facebook neediness. After all, you excuse yourself, your friends might think it's remiss of you not to be around!

Nostalgia has you in its grip. When Facebook starts becoming a way through which you're living in the past, it's a sign of needing to break from it.Rehashing old loves and friendships with the hope that you can pinpoint the exact moment where your life should have taken a different turn and trying to patch it up through fantasizing over Facebook is looking backwards and beating yourself up over what didn't work out. Realize the importance of living in the here and now. This type of nostalgia is even more damaging if you have a loose tongue about the relationships you're actually in because other people will be reading your words and some may perceive them as a betrayal or as signs of an emotional affair.
You have tons of friends on Facebook but you still feel very lonely.;
, Rather than simply going on Facebook and ""falling under its spell"", start consciously determining what you're really getting out of Facebook. Asking questions about its value to you in your own life's context is healthy, especially when you feel that you might have been overdoing it a bit. Whittle down to the things that bring real value, within a defined time limitation. Record what you're doing on Facebook for a week. Be diligent about this reality check task and don't spare yourself; buy a small notebook and devote time to its updating. Things in particular to keep an eye out for include:

If you're just checking in to respond to pokes, to see friends updating their profiles, to write a new note, or to see what songs your friends are adding, you're addicted to trivia. And letting trivia run your day is not conducive to a satisfying life long-term!
Are you wandering about Facebook aimlessly? You've just confirmed a new friend, and you're curious as to the friends of that friend and whether any are your friends, or could be your friends, and what those friends are doing? If this sounds all too familiar, your time on Facebook has turned aimless. And you're being lulled into this by the connectivity ease of Facebook without being alert to the lack of productivity resulting.
Are you excusing yourself because of work? Even someone using Facebook for business purposes can start allowing the business socializing to bleed into general socializing under the rubric of ""work"". It's important to notice when you're falling into this transitional phase and to demarcate work and socializing, in order to put a time limit on both. Otherwise, you're giving yourself too large a justification to just keep on keeping on Facebook.
Is that friend really a friend? How beneficial is maintaining a friendship with someone you've never met but linked up just because they were a friend of a friend of a real friend of yours? They might be amazing but if they're barely connecting with you, they might be part of the peripheral distractions that are causing you to sink into Facebook rather than interact on Facebook in ways that have true value.
Is any of what you're doing constructive either from a personal or a professional point of view? Be honest with yourself!

, Whatever the reason for being a part of Facebook, boundaries matter and knowing what is of value and what is not will help you to rein in poor online habits. Even a reason of wanting to ensure that your family is kept up-to-date of your interstate or overseas happenings can meander out of control if your concept of ""family"" expands. If you use Facebook for work and personal reasons, the value will probably be broader, but it is still important to define the value boundaries for work and personal time. When deciding upon what value you're getting out of Facebook, consider the following:

Are you enjoying it? Is this enjoyment balanced with a whole range of other enjoyable pursuits in your life too?
Do you feel obliged to respond to some people on Facebook even though you'd prefer not to?
Which parts of Facebook really do improve your personal and professional life? It can be helpful to list these for clarity, and to clear some of the negativity and the trivia.

, This article is not advocating leaving Facebook entirely unless that's the choice you feel you want to take. However, it can be very advantageous to choose a special event and to decide that for the duration of that event, that you will not use Facebook at all. You can even warn your other Facebook friends that this event is coming up but whatever you do, stick to it. For example, some Facebook users take summer vacation breaks, some take a break for a religious observance such as Lent,and some people take breaks when special family events such as a wedding or a birthday are coming up and they need to prepare, travel, be available for it, etc., without wanting to be distracted.

Any well defined event carries significance for breaking a habit because they represent occasions during which you need to focus on other than yourself, whether it be faith, family, or some other important external matter. This can help to take you outside of any internal funk that has you glued to Facebook, as well as providing a set period during which you've promised yourself that you won't use Facebook. During this break, reflect on your Facebook neediness and think through how to restore a more even-keeled approach to using Facebook.
The good thing about telling your Facebook friends that you won't be on for a bit is that you've just burned a bridge that will cause you to ""lose face"" if you do sneak on. Be strong and give them the reassurance that you're one to keep your word.

, While you could quit Facebook, it's probably far more productive, constructive, and socially useful to manage it and to put Facebook in its place in your life. Some of the positive solutions for healthy Facebook usage include (and you'll think of others):

Avoid fiddling with the periphery. Take a good look at your profile. Does it work for you or does it bother you? Changing a profile image over and over is a sign of worrying too much about your Facebook image. If the current image works, leave it be. If it bothers you, fix it right now, photo included. Why? Because once you fix it, be prepared to leave it alone for a long time. Keeping your profile stable will build trust in the online environment; not constantly trying to update it will spare you one more unnecessary fiddle on Facebook.
Stop changing your status frequently. Think ""so what?"" before attempting to do this. Every time you change it, it clogs up your friends' news feeds. Why do you feel compelled to announce your every move or mood you are temporarily experiencing? It ceases to be of interest for others, and it's more unnecessary fiddling for you!
Think of how often you use Facebook applications. In order to use an application, you must install it on your account. And then use it; and many apps are compelling enough to draw users in for hours at a time.Before adding any application ask yourself ""How productive is this?"" If it is worthless, think about what it's doing to your friends who get to be at the receiving end of your invitations to gain points, receive gifts, or to see results... Each time a person receives an invitation, they need to accept or ignore it. Don't be the cause of other people's fiddling. And make applications work for you, not the other way round; get rid of the ones that are sheer time-wasters or pointless.

, If you're driven to have more friends on Facebook than you can ever realistically engage with regularly, it's important to stop what is, effectively, a ""friendship addiction"".Having more friends than you can realistically connect with can be a source of anxiety rather than pleasure. Enjoy the friends you already have on Facebook but weed out those who aren't adding anything to your Facebook experience.

Given that Facebook almost compels you to add friends, if you're vulnerable to defining your self worth through the amount of friendships rather than the quality of them, then Facebook can be dangerous for you while you're recovering from any other sort of addiction or going through emotionally difficult times.Resist the urge to add people you don't really know or want to engage with, and to cull those who mean very little to you from your friends list.
Beware of the potential of Facebook to increase a sense of loneliness rather than assuage it. Spending time on Facebook rather than with face-to-face friends will increase any feelings of loneliness you may already have and ironically, the more people you're trying to keep apace with, the lonelier it'll seem because you'll end up with quantity rather than quality.Switch from using Facebook as a substitute for friendships to using it as a way to energize and synergize the friendships you already have., If you're caught saying, ""I'll Facebook you later"" or ""I'm going to do some Facebooking"", then you're well overdue for taking a break from the site to hang out with friends in the real world (or offline life). Every time you feel like saying ""I'll Facebook you"", check yourself and rephrase that with ""I'll see you"", or ""I'll call you"". And mean it - settle the catch-up time straight away..., Ask someone to put password on your PC or laptop so you can´t go on Facebook. In an extreme case, delete your Facebook account. By knowing ahead that you will never go back to it, you find a way to enjoy other stuff you're doing in the present instead of being impatient and thinking ""How much longer is it going to be till I check Facebook one more time?"", No matter how much news feed you get, there could have been even more that there wasn't. There's no difference between missing a post and that post never having existed which you would have had no problem with. The point is to see at least one super-interesting post, not to see all of them. Sometimes somebody thinks of a topic and wishes there existed a YouTube video on that topic but that's a lot rarer than an endless chain of deciding that since you saw a suggestion, it looks interesting so you decide you must see it., When using Facebook you can choose what appears on your timeline, by liking pages, joining groups and hiding annoying people you create a custom made ""safe-web-space"" filled with information that appeals to you with no negatives. Unblock those who constantly post selfies and share Britain First posts and simply visit the websites of pages you enjoy (or find alternatives) rather than viewing them through Facebook. Nothing short of a library will cure your information addiction."

Both Firefox and Chrome are free to download.;
, There are several plugins available that will allow you to block sites such as Facebook that keep you from your work. One of the most popular extensions for Firefox is LeechBlock, while Chrome's most popular extension is StayFocused.



Install LeechBlock on FireFox. Click the Firefox button and select Add-ons. Enter leechblock into the ""Search all add-ons"" field. Click the Install button to the right of the LeechBlock entry of the search results. LeechBlock will be automatically downloaded and installed. Restart Firefox.

Install StayFocused on Chrome. Click the Chrome menu button. Select Tools → Extensions. Scroll to the bottom of the list and click the ""Get more extensions"" link. Enter stayfocused into the ""Search the store"" field. Click the ""+Free"" button next to StayFocused at the top of the Extensions results. Click the ""Add"" button in the confirmation box that appears.

Install Nanny on Chrome. Visit the Chrome Web Store. Nanny for Google Chrome can block sites, such as Facebook, on your Chrome. Use the search field on the top left corner of the page to search for it. From the search results, click on Nanny for Google Chrome to see more details about it. Click the “Add to Chrome” button on the top right corner of the page. A confirmation message will appear informing you of what the new extension will do. Click on the “Add” button.

, Once you've installed your extension, you will need to configure it to block Facebook and set the times that you want it blocked. The process is a little different in each extension.



LeechBlock - Click the Firefox menu and select Add-ons. Find LeechBlock on the list and click the Options button. Add ""www.facebook.com"" to the large text field in the middle of the Options window.

Click the ""When to block"" tab and set your block schedule. All times are entered in 24-hour format. You can set sites to be blocked after a certain amount of time on them or during specific times of the day, or both.
Click the ""How to block"" tab to select what happens when you visit a blocked site. By default, it will go to a LeechBlock notification, but you can set it to redirect to any site that you wish.
Click the Advanced tab to set your advanced options. These include disabling the LeechBlock options menu during your blocked hours and blocking access to Firefox configuration menus. Only select these if you understand the consequences of doing so (you will not be able to get to these menus, even if you need them for other programs, during the block time).
Add a password. Click the Access Control tab at the top of the Options window to add a password to LeechBlock. This password is not for security, but to add an extra roadblock between you and disabling the block. This will give you extra time to consider disabling the block and being unproductive.



StayFocused. Click the StayFocused icon in your browser toolbar. It should have appeared immediately after installing the extension. Click the ""Settings"" link at the bottom of the box that appears.

Click the ""Blocked Sites"" menu option. You can find it in the menu on the left side of the Settings page. Add ""www.facebook.com"" to the field and click the ""Add Blocked Sites"" button. If you want to keep yourself from disabling StayFocused, click the ""Block the Chrome Extensions page!"" to add the Extensions page to your blocked list.
Set your blocking schedule. Use the top four menu options to set your blocking schedule. ""Max Time Allowed"" lets you enable a timer for all of your blocked sites. Once you reach this time limit, you can no longer access the blocked sites for the day. ""Active Days"" lets you set what days StayFocused enforces the block. ""Active Hours"" sets the time of day that the sites are blocked for. ""Daily Reset Time"" is the time of day that your time limit resets.
Adjust the Nuclear Option. This is the last-resort button for increasing your productivity. By default it will block ALL sites for the specified time, but you can change it to just block the sites on your list.
Add a challenge. If you feel like you'll be tempted to disable the block, you can add a challenge to get back into the settings. You will be required to type a specific paragraph without making any typos or backspaces.



Nanny. Click the button with three horizontal lines at the upper right corner of your Google Chrome browser. This will bring out a submenu. Look for “Settings” and click on it. From the Settings page, click the Extensions link from the left panel menu. The Extensions page will load, listing all the extensions installed on your Google Chrome browser. You can see Nanny for Google Chrome here.

Open the settings for Nanny for Google Chrome. Click the Options link under Nanny for Google Chrome. This will open another window or tab for Nanny for Google Chrome’s settings.
Block Facebook for a certain period. Click the “Blocked URLs” tab on the settings page. This is where you can configure what and when to block sites like Facebook.
Type in the name of the block set, like “Facebook block,” in the Block Set field.
Type in “facebook.com” in the URLs field. You can also type in other sites you want to block with Facebook.
Key in the start and end times when Facebook will be blocked in the Blocked Time field. The format should be in military time, e.g., 0900-1700,1900-2100 for 9AM-5PM and 7PM-9PM, respectively. It can accept multiple time slots separated by a comma.
Tick the checkboxes for the days when the block will be active. If you want to only block Facebook on weekdays, you should tick Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday only.
Save. When you’re done configuring when to block Facebook, click the “Save URL” button at the bottom for the form. Nanny for Google Chrome will be activated when the set times come, and you won’t be able to access Facebook anymore during those times.



, Once your schedule and Facebook block is set, your extension is active. In order to disable it, you will need to go through whatever steps you put in place to keep yourself from doing so. Try to resist!


Install extensions on all of your installed browsers to keep you from switching between them to circumnavigate the block.

Then, select ""Skip the Inbox (Archive it)""., If you enjoy getting mobile notifications at some times, but not at others, you can simply turn off your Facebook app’s access to cellular data as a kind of temporary “do not disturb” option.

Simply visit the ""Settings"" area on your phone and look for a tab marked ""Cellular"" or ""Cellular Data."" Here you will be able to switch off cellular data for individual apps, or for phone you phone altogether.

, A more drastic way to limit your Facebook is to delete the app from your phone altogether.

You can use a timer on your phone, a kitchen timer, or any number of online timers or apps. Simply decide how long you’d like to spend on Facebook, set the timer, and when it rings, swiftly log out., Many apps exist that allow you to block social media or even internet use altogether. Some of these apps are available for purchase (such as Freedom or Anti-Social), and others can be downloaded for free (Self-control, which is Mac only, and LeechBlock). The basic premise is that these apps block you from visiting sites like Facebook according to a schedule you design., Instead of habitually going on Facebook whenever you sit down at your computer, use Facebook as a treat or incentive. This is a good idea if you find yourself ending up on Facebook when you're supposed to be working.For example, you can decide, ""I'll allow myself to go on for 15 minutes after I finish this assignment.""
Alternatively: ""I'll look at those new pictures after I finish this chore.""

, Decide how many times per day you will allow yourself to visit Facebook. Then, set a schedule for yourself, and stick to it. For instance, you may decide to visit Facebook once in the morning, and then once again after dinner. It will require a great deal of self-discipline, but if you make this your habit, eventually it will stick.

, If all else fails and you feel that you need a break, you can always deactivate your Facebook account. It is only temporary; you can make your Facebook page live again whenever you are ready."

Remember that Facebook is not an important part of who you are.,
Understand what Facebook pettiness consists of.,
Chill about friend rejects.,
Cease fuming over Facebook comments.,
Laugh at your own trivial obsessions.,
Extricate yourself from your friends' Facebook update dramas.,
If you change relationship status with someone in your life, be sure to update the change on Facebook too.,
Balance Facebook with the rest of your online time and life offline.",How to Not Dwell on Petty Facebook Issues," This may come as a surprise to some avid users of Facebook but it's a simple fact. Keep it absolutely clear in your mind that Facebook doesn't define you. And what people with their online bravado and cyber persona's think of you or your Facebook page is not important.;
, In the case of Facebook (or any online interactive forum), pettiness includes such acts as excessive sharing of opinions over something that should have been put to rest many posts ago, whine-trances that never end, griping about things that are tiresome and trivial, poking fun at people in mean-spirited ways, attacks on a person's personality, beliefs, or abilities, and similar pointless, thoughtless, and meaning-deprived actions. In turn, treating any of these sorts of acts as worthy of dwelling upon is harmful to your mental health and overall well-being, and makes being on Facebook unpleasant rather than fun.

, Anyone who rejects your friend request is likely not a friend worth chasing so don't sweat it. Perhaps you've simply asked someone who barely recognizes you, or perhaps some bad or inappropriate things you've done in the past that impacted this person has caused them to be twice as cautious about you than ever. Have you been squeaky clean on Facebook or have you done something that could make them not wish to be associated with you? 'Fess up – perhaps you have annoyed or upset them somehow. Whatever the reason, don't dwell on it but do concentrate on those people happy to be your Facebook friends; they deserve your attention.


Sometimes the source is your own actions, most other times it's for reasons over which you have absolutely no control. People reject friend requests for a huge range of reasons that simply are not personal. Things such as being busy, feeling they already have too many friends on Facebook, an unwillingness to increase their friendship circle, not even checking their Facebook account because of other life commitments, and so forth. To imagine that it is a personal rejection is to create something that isn't there, so don't do it; and even if it is, don't give the other person the power over you by dwelling on it. Easy come, easy go.

, From time to time, accept that some people will leave undermining, picky, and downright provocative comments. Sometimes it's because they're in a bad mood and you just happen to be the Page they're focused on; other times, they feel riled by something you've said or shared, whether or not they have any reason to feel aggrieved (and even when they do have reason, they should express themselves calmly). Accept that some people are not as good as others at restraining themselves from off-the-cuff commenting without sleeping on their words, or that some people think they're being super smart by leaving cryptic but clearly attacking comments on your Page. The best thing you can do? Ignore the comments and let them speak for themselves when others read them. Water off a duck's back.


Keep your Facebook page relevant, considerate, and polite. People will be less inclined to leave snide, churlish or nitpicking comments if there is nothing inconsiderate or provocative worth commenting on negatively. However, if being thought-provoking is your preference, then be prepared for the feisty feedback!
If your Facebook page is fairly benign, non-provocative, and general in nature, then perhaps it's jealousy, boredom, or just sheer stupidity involved in any unpleasant comments being left. Realize it's all about what's missing inside the snarky commenter and it's not about you. Some people are, to all intents and purposes, just plain rude.
Be firm with people who seek to push your buttons without worrying about their insistence that you're being unreasonable or unfair. You know you're not being unreasonable or unfair, and that you're seeking a better form of interaction with those you perceive as friends on Facebook, so don't let their irritation drive your own responses or feelings. The louder they squawk, the less likely they have a point.

, All of us can fall prey at one time or another to believing that something really matters so much that we need to focus on it to the exclusion of all else. And in the realm of Facebook, this can turn into hammering home a point using updates and pictures over and again until our friends cry ""enough, already!"". If someone notices you doing this and picks you up on it, instead of responding aggressively or defensively, try laughing at the trap you've fallen into. Realize that you have just turned something petty into something that you did nothing else but dwell upon. Make fun of your pettiness, obsessiveness, unappreciative attitude, or grandstanding. It won't take long to bring you back to reality and to put a halt your trivial updates. A brief apology for your obsession detouring to your Facebook friends is adequate, then move on.


Instead of responding in a knee-jerk, impatient reaction to people who leave inflammatory comments on your Facebook page, laugh it off and ""release the pettiness"". You'll be respected for coping and showing that you can rise above the dramas and trivialities. Avoid death by mouse-clicking at all costs.
If you wouldn't say something to a person's face, do not say it to them on Facebook. Period.

, Some people love drama in their life and will do anything to both create and attract it, using wall posts and even pictures to create a scene and to turn tiny issues into ""serious problem of the week"" when in actual fact, as with all drama, it's petty and it's unnecessary. It also clogs up your time with inessential nonsense that won't make one iota of difference to your career, your studies, your future aspirations but it could very well bog you down in reading stuff that will distract you from what you need to be concentrating on. Let the drama-llamas discover the psychologist they need by refusing to be the audience they seek.


Don't get involved in Facebook fights. Petty as, oh so stupid, and very easily mired in misunderstandings! At the end of the day, ""who cares"" should be your motto, and go find something more meaningful to spend you energies on.
Following someone else's personal problems in great detail via Facebook says something about you too – it suggests that you may well not have much of a life that you're proud of and that you're very vulnerable to getting a kick from nosing around other people's adventures. Stop longing for something better and start creating your own adventurous life instead.

, It's not fair to leave it there as a form of ""hope"". To the other person, it serves as a burden to see you still pretending the two of you are together and it makes it seem as if they've somehow done the wrong thing by you, when in reality it takes two to end a relationship. Moreover, do not use Facebook to stalk your ex, to monitor their every movement, every update, every possible new love interest. Move on or you're guilty of using Facebook to dwell on the past. In future, you may even decide not to make such open declarations of romantic attachments via Facebook anyway, to save trivializing such an important and yet very personal part of your life into a Facebook sideshow.

, The adage recommends moderation in everything, and Facebook and online life are certainly included. The ease with which people can respond negatively and with intimidation online is just too evident; lacking the facial and body language cues, lacking the usual restraints of face-to-face etiquette, the web mob or anonymous fruitcake mentality sometimes takes over. See it all for what it is, don't take it personally and get off the site regularly to regain your sense of perspective.


If you're dwelling too much and running your life on things that happen on your Facebook, delete it! People survived long before Facebook and you'll survive without it too. In fact, in a decade's time, quite possibly Facebook will be old-fashioned and funny in hindsight; just don't let that be a bittersweet funny for you!
Get the context of Facebook. There is always a bigger picture than our own worries, failures, and relationship squabbles and if Facebook is making you feel like they're insurmountable or gargantuan problems, then it's probable you've turned them into something more than they really are.
Even politics is petty in the online environment. Do you seriously think the big decisions and the ideas that count are going to come forth from nasty political spats on Facebook Pages? Absolutely not!

Unfriend them!",How to Reveal a Fake Facebook Account," First and foremost, somebody with a fake account is—almost by definition—a con artist. Unless you run with that crowd, you probably don't want them in your life.

While they may present themselves as a friend, or even a romantic interest, their sole purpose in friending you may be as harmless as a mind game, or they may be after much more, such as your money, goods and property.
The impostor might also be setting you up to steal your identity or valuable information from you that they can use to manipulate someone else.;
, At the least, think twice about accepting friend requests from people you don't know and who are not connected to you through legitimate, verifiable means. If you're not sure, do the following:


Ask them questions: What makes them want to be your friend? How did they find out about you? Who do you know in common? By clicking on their name, you can see if you have any mutual friends. If you do, contact your friend. If not—that's a big red flag.

, At the very least, it can be fun. You might also find out that your would-be ""friend"" is really bad news. Here are some things to sleuth out:

, Does what is being said add up or are there some really hard-to-believe statements being made?


For example, maybe there is a photo of a very young person next to claims of being a professor or a CEO. Does the embellishment seem more than the usual ""making oneself look good"" and come across as simply implausible? Trust your own senses on this one. You could even ask for proof of some of the things the person has stated—they're approaching you, after all. You have every right to make sure they're legitimate.

, Is there only one? Is it way too perfect or does it seem touched up in any way? Maybe you've seen it before? A good photo — or a touched up one — may not be a negative sign, but it could be that they've simple scoured Google for an attractive photo, thinking nobody would ever find out. Try this:


Click and drag their profile picture to your desktop.






Launch Google Chrome or Firefox, and navigate to Google Images.






Drag and drop the profile pic into the search field: it will expand, as shown:






Google will either return an exact match (with information like names), or pictures similar to the original.







, This won't be so useful if the name is a common one, but for a more unusual one there might be some interesting returns.


If they have a common name, add other information such as their location, approximate age, or any other information you can glean from their profile.
Have they been tagged? A real person is generally tagged here and there as part of the Facebook sharing experience.

, Are their friends global or local? The more local the friends, the more likely the person is to be real. The more global their friendship list, with very few or no local friends, start getting suspicious.


The lack of local friends suggests that this is not a real person you're dealing with but a fake account. This is often used by people pretending to be attractive young women. They will often contact you with a line like ""I saw your picture and you looked nice.""

, If you don't have a good feeling about somebody, there's a simple solution: don't just turn down the request for friendship, block them completely.


Click on their Facebook name, and go to their Timeline. On the right, under the Cover Photo, click on the Message settings:
You can block them from contacting you, or report them to Facebook if you feel they are a threat or involved in illicit or illegal activities.

, If you're in the (not-so-great) habit of accepting friend requests from friends of friends' friends, or friend people because they seem to have similar tastes to yours in music, cooking, dancing, or whatever, then you leave yourself open to the occasional fake.


While you can make wonderful connections in this way, try to always have someone you do know vouch for this person first. And if that's not possible, be alert to signs of weird behavior, such as suddenly bombarding you with likes, comments, photos, etc. on a daily basis.
If you hardly know this person, they should be taking things slowly and politely, not invading your space immediately.
If, after a week or two, you're not comfortable with your new friend, unfriend them!

, At one time it was probably reasonable to think that if someone had a group of friends interacting with them and vouching for each other, that that person must be real. Not anymore!


There are increasing cases of one person running numerous fake Facebook accounts, pretending to be an array of different people, all vouching for one another and all trying to be friends with someone real!
An excellent example is the case of Natalia Burgess, who wove a web of deceit and caused many young males to fall for her various aliases — all because she felt inadequately loved.Sadly, impostors of this sort go to incredible lengths to create an array of fake accounts including other social media accounts and websites to give the impression that their fake personas are ""real"".

, If you're being targeted by an elaborate web of lies, eventually these start to unravel. This is most evident in someone who is trying to maintain several fake Facebook accounts at once and eventually, they will drop the ball and mix up their stories.


If you start noticing this in response to questions, or in their comments, take note and remain alert for more inconsistencies.

, For example: if an adult is pretending to be a teen, they may say something that dates them by referring to a historic event or person that teens wouldn't really know much about. Or they may prove to know way too much about a topic that someone they're claiming to be would not.


Take note of what the suspicious person says, as everyone slips up! No one is perfect, and they're bound to eventually say something that will give you a hint that your hunch is correct.

, If someone you've never met, who lives thousands of miles away from you, and who has barely revealed themselves gets amorous with you, be suspicious. Sometimes the faker does this because they love the feeling of playing with the life and feelings of someone else; sometimes it's because they're in love with online love but are too afraid to reveal their true selves (or they're in a relationship in real life); and other times it could be that they're after something, like money, sex, or drugs.


Question your own feelings and motivations if you start to feel something for a person who declares they love you online. Is it too sudden? Too weird? Too freaky? A little bit icky? Trust those feelings and delete this fake friend from your account.
If they ask you for sexy pictures, immediately be suspicious. A fake account is a good shill for getting free pornographic material that then gets passed around online.

, If you're suspicious, unsure, or uncomfortable with having them as part of your Facebook friends, pull the plug. It's not like they're your real friends or family, and they could cause you a lot of future problems.


Warn other friends of yours on Facebook if you know they have also friended the fake account; one of the tactics of an impostor is to befriend others in your circle of friends to try to make the friendship seem more ""real"".

Review the Community Standards of the Facebook Marketplace.,
Check out the seller's profile.,
Use Facebook Messenger cautiously.,
Pay only with secured payment systems.,
Meet local sellers in a safe area.",How to Avoid Facebook Marketplace Scams1," The Community Standards detail responsible buying and selling practices, as well as list items that are prohibited for sale in the Marketplace.Scammers may post a listing for items that are prohibited under Marketplace guidelines, pocketing your cash and never completing the transaction.
Scammers also will often request payment or delivery of an item in a way that is outside the general guidelines. Using alternative means of payment or delivery gives you fewer protections as a buyer, which is why scammers try to steer you toward these methods.;
, One of the benefits Facebook Marketplace has over other online person-to-person sale and auction websites is that you must have a Facebook account to post a listing or buy an item. Checking the seller's profile will help you determine whether the seller is legitimate or a possible scam artist.Keep in mind that a legitimate seller may have a lot of information that is restricted to friends only, but you might not get a lot of information from their public profile. However, you can still see their main profile picture and how long they've had a Facebook account.
For example, if a seller only started their Facebook account the day before they posted the listing, they may be attempting to scam you.

, Facebook allows you to talk to the seller using Facebook Messenger to negotiate a final price and close the sale. If you suspect the listing is fraudulent, be careful what you say to the seller.Avoid giving out any personal information. Don't give the seller your bank account or credit card number over Facebook Messenger, or any other information the seller could potentially use to steal your identity.
If the seller is claiming to be local but you don't believe they are, you can ask them questions about local events or different neighborhoods to gauge their actual familiarity with the area.
Use your best judgement and if you have a bad feeling in your gut after talking to them, shut down the transaction.

, If you're completing the purchase online, payment systems such as PayPal offer you protections as a buyer in the event the seller does not deliver the item you purchase.Scam artists often will try to get you to pay with a money order, cash, or wire transfer. Avoid these methods of payment – even with local sellers – because if the seller runs off with your money, you won't have any way to trace it or get it back.
If a local seller wants cash, use your best judgment. Generally, a legitimate seller will not refuse a method of payment that you offer. Secured payment systems offer benefits and greater confidence to sellers as well.

, The Facebook Marketplace originally was designed to be used primarily by people who lived in the same area. However, just because someone lives near you doesn't mean they're not going to scam you.Be wary of a seller who wants you to come to their house, or who wants to meet at night. Insist on making the exchange in a public place during daylight hours – especially if you are paying them in person.
Many local police precincts will allow you to meet the person in their parking lot, or in the vestibule of the station. If you have this option available, it is the most secure place to meet a seller.

Be aware when people are taking photos of you.,
Go up to the photographer and ask them what they intend doing with the photos.,
Explain why you don't want your photo included.,
Expect surprise but be kindly firm.,
Wear sunglasses and a hat when out in public.,
Ask nicely.,
Seek further advice.",How to Ask People to Not Place Photos of You Online," At parties, family gatherings, office events, etc., take note of who is taking the photos.;
, Ask them to reassure you that they won't place any photos containing you into a public online site or forum.

, There are many possible reasons and these will be entirely up to you. Some reasons might include:


Faith, spiritual or religious reasons.
Personal privacy reasons.
A simple but relevant personal preference not to be added online.

, Many people will be surprised at your request. It's not common yet for people to make such a request and so you may encounter a disappointed, surprised or even irritable response to your request. Be patient and simply insist kindly but firmly that you do not want your photo placed online without your consent.


It is a good idea to work through an explanation of your preference for not having your photo uploaded to the internet prior to having to face this situation.

, If you're really concerned about photos being taken of yourself randomly when out and about, do what the stars do and cover up as best you can. To your advantage, your relative anonymity will make it harder to work out it's you once the hat, glasses, scarf and any other covering elements are all in place.

, If you come across a photo of yourself somewhere online, such as on Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, etc. and you have not authorized it or don't want it there, ask the uploader to politely remove it. Being nice and explaining carefully why the image's online presence upsets you may be enough to have the uploader remove it.


Be aware that it is hard to get images removed from online even if the original person removes it. This is because search engines cache images and they may also have been shared around among many other people. This is why it's best to try to stop uploads initially or to do your best to conceal yourself in public.

, The legality or otherwise of someone placing a photo of you online against your express will is dependent on the context and the laws of your jurisdiction. Whether or not you can have a photo of yourself removed from online will depend on the terms and conditions of the site, the identifiable expression of your preference to the photographer and other factors and it's probably best to get privacy or legal advice if an incident occurs where you want your photo removed after someone else has uploaded it.


It becomes much more difficult to have photos removed when your photo is taken as part of a general crowd. Removal on legal grounds would probably be dependent on finding a cause of action such as the photo being defamatory or illegal, etc. and that is likely to be pretty hard to prove.

Accept only the exact purchase price.,
Look at the buyer's profile.,
Speak to the buyer on Facebook Messenger.,
Limit acceptable methods of payment.,
Ship items domestically only.,
Meet local buyers in a well-lit, public location.",How to Avoid Facebook Marketplace Scams2," In one common scam, the scam artist/buyer offers to pay you more for the item than you are asking. The scam artist then says you can mail them a check or money order for the difference.What actually happens here is that the scam artist's payment fails, but they have already received the amount you reimbursed them for the ""overpayment."" They may also have received the item as well.
There is no legitimate reason a person would need to pay you more than your asking price for an item, expecting you to give them back the difference.

, If you want to buy an item on the Facebook Marketplace, you must have a Facebook profile. A legitimate buyer will have a robust profile, while a scam artist likely will have a skeletal profile created recently.Some users' privacy settings may limit the amount of information you can glean from their profile. However, you'll still be able to see their main profile picture and a general chronology of the profile itself.

, One advantage of the Facebook Marketplace is that it allows you to have a conversation with your buyer within Facebook. However, use caution if you suspect the buyer is a scammer.If the buyer claims to be local but you suspect they aren't, ask them questions about local events or neighborhoods. Depending on their answers, you'll know how familiar they actually are with the area.
Don't ignore gut feelings. If you feel like something just isn't right, don't be afraid to pull out of the transaction and call off the sale.

, Secure payment systems offer protection for buyers as well as for sellers. Scam artists frequently will request to pay in some alternate way, such as by giving you gift cards.With the gift card scam, the gift cards typically have a zero balance, or were stolen and cannot be used.
Money transfer services or wire services don't provide any guarantee that the money will arrive, or give you any protection if you send the item and never receive payment.

, Some scam artists will request that you ship the item they've purchased to another country. During the time it takes the item to arrive, their payment has already failed.The idea behind this scam is that you will see that you've been paid and go ahead and ship the item. Later, the payment fails or the buyer's check bounces, and it's too late for you to reverse the shipment of the item.
You can avoid this scam by stating clearly in your listing where you are willing to ship the item, and refusing to deviate from this.

, Local scam artists may try to steal from buyers, and they can take more than just the item you had listed for sale. Be especially wary if you are selling electronics, or smaller items that can be easily taken.Refuse to meet the buyer in a rundown location or seedy part of town, and don't meet up at night.
Check with your local police precinct to see if you can meet your buyer in their parking lot or just inside the station. A scam artist/buyer who is intending to rob you or rip you off will balk at this location.

"

Report the item to Facebook.,
File a report with the FBI.,
Contact local police.",How to Avoid Facebook Marketplace Scams3," The Facebook Marketplace has a simple, three step process for reporting a listing that you believe is a scam, or that otherwise violates the Facebook Marketplace Community Standards.Go to the Marketplace and find the item you suspect is a scam. When you click on that post, you'll see a link that says ""Report Post"" on the bottom right. Click that link and follow the instructions to make your report.

, In the United States, you can report a Facebook Marketplace scam to the FBI using the Department's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). You can use this service if you live in the U.S., even if the scammer is elsewhere or you don't know where the scammer lives. If you live outside the U.S., you can still file a report if you have reason to believe the scammer is located in the U.S.Go to the website at https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx to learn more about the service and file your report. The information you provide will go into a database that is used by federal, state, and local law enforcement to identify patterns of fraudulent activity.
Gather all the information you have about the person who posted the scam listing as well as the listing itself.
While filing a report with the FBI does not mean that law enforcement will actively investigate your case specifically, it does help their efforts and may lead to additional evidence that helps stop the scammer.

, Especially if the scammer appears to live in your local area, filing a police report may help authorities handle the situation. Keep in mind that someone who attempts to scam one person will likely attempt it again.If you've already reported to the IC3, you can provide that report to your local police. Bring all the information and documentation you have about the transaction, including a print-out of any conversations you had with the scam artist through Facebook Messenger.
Go to the police station in person to file your report. Do not call 911 or your country's equivalent emergency number unless there is an actual emergency and you feel your life or safety is in immediate danger.
Get a copy of the police report for your records. You may want to call the officer who filed the report after a week or two to follow up if you haven't heard any news on the status of your case.

Add an HTML box application to your profile.,
Find a free counter service online.,
Generate your HTML code.,
Paste the code into your HTML box app.,
Analyze the numbers.",How to See Who Views Your Facebook Profile1," By default, Facebook does not have a mechanism that allows you to input static HTML on your profile. In order to use HTML coding, you will need to add a Facebook app designed to display static HTML or FBML boxes.Do a Facebook search for ""HTML box"" or ""FBML box."" Several apps should pop up in the search results.
Quickly review an app before you install it. Look in the ""About"" section to verify that it will do what you want it to do, and do a quick Internet search to verify that the app is legitimate instead of being a scam. Search something along the lines of ""App Name legitimate"" or ""App Name scam.""
Since these applications do not strictly violate Facebook policy, they are not usually banned unless proven to be spam.
Once the app is installed, you can place the stat counter code inside the HTML or FBML box it displays.;
, There is no single HTML code that will generate a generic page counter.As a result, you will need to do an Internet search for ""free HTML page counter"" or ""free HTML statistics counter.""


Review the terms of the counter service carefully before using it. Make sure that it does not require any personal information, including login information for your Facebook account, and make sure that it is 100% free.
Know which sort of HTML to look for. A CGI script is the best option. These scripts display a graphic counter that changes each time someone views your page.
Avoid PHP counters, since these typically require you to save the script in a text document within your website's directory. You do not have a directory of pages and files associated with your Facebook profile. In short, these counters will not work on Facebook.
Javascript counters are an acceptable option. Facebook does not permit the use of Javascript on its website, but there are free converters online that will convert Javascript into a usable HTML code. Do an Internet search for ""free Javascript conversion"" to find one

, Follow the on-screen instructions to create the HTML code for your Facebook page.


Note that many free counter services will require you to create an account before you can use them.
You may need to specify the website URL you plan to use your counter on. In this case, it would be the URL for your Facebook profile or timeline.

, Once the code is generated, copy and paste it into the HTML box made available by the HTML or FBML box app you installed.


You may need to confirm the code by pressing an ""OK"" or ""Confirm"" button before it will be applied to your profile.
Depending on the app you use, this counter will either show up on the app page or on your timeline.

, Since this method only shows you how many views your profile has had rather than who has visited it, you will need to monitor the numbers and think carefully about the reasons they may spike or drop.


If a friend or old love interest just returned to town after being away for a long time, he or she may be responsible for any spikes in page views.
If you just made a new friend or met someone knew, he or she may be the cause of an increased number of page views.
If you just broke up with someone or had a falling out with a friend, this could result in a decrease in page views.
If you suspect that someone has been following or stalking you, and you see your counter numbers rise, this may back up your suspicions.

Take a look at your friend suggestions.",How to See Who Views Your Facebook Profile3," Facebook specifically states that the friends at the top of your chat sidebar ""are people you’ve interacted with frequently or recently on Facebook.""The same applies to those friends listed in the friends section of your main timeline screen.


Note that people who only view your profile without commenting, liking, or otherwise providing physical proof of their presence will not usually appear on either list.
The interaction Facebook uses goes both ways. In other words, the people on your chat sidebar or timeline are people you talk to frequently and those who talk back frequently, as well. The list is not strictly composed based on people who frequently view your profile.
This may help you figure out who visits your profile most frequently depending on how active you are on Facebook. If you rarely initiate interaction on Facebook or interact equally with a large number of people, the people who interact with your profile will carry greater weight in determining who appears on your chat sidebar or timeline.
When using the friends list on your timeline, you may need to refresh the page several times to get an accurate reading. The friends you interact with frequently will appear time and time again, but a few random friends will always be thrown in, as well. These random friends will change as you refresh the page, but the constant ones will rarely change.

,


Responses are sectioned off into three sections: accepted invitations, rejected invitations, and invitations still waiting for a reply.
Supposedly, the top five people listed in each category are the friends in each category that view your profile most often.

, In your Facebook search bar, begin typing out a search request simply by typing the first letter of a possible request. Do this one letter at a time, deleting the initial letter before starting with a new one.


If you recently visited a friend whose name starts with that letter or frequently visit a friend whose name starts with that letter, that friend will be the first in the list to appear.
On the other hand, if you type a letter that does not belong to such a friend or if a person whose profile you rarely visit shows up at the top of the results, there is a decent chance that the friend who shows up is either the last person to visit your page whose name started with that letter or the person who visits your page the most.

, Your friend suggestions can provide hints about who might be checking out your profile even though they are not on your friend's list.


If you receive a friend suggestion from someone with no shared or mutual friends, there is a decent chance that the person being suggested is someone who visited your profile.
If you receive a friend suggestion that shares a mutual friend, the suggested friend may or may not have viewed your profile.

If you feel genuinely threatened, humiliated, harassed, or you're in fear, as a result of what the other person has been posting on Facebook, seek help quickly.",How to Deal With Facebook Stalkers," While stalking on Facebook doesn't have the physical elements of being stalked in the real world, such as being followed or watched, etc., the feelings unleashed tend to be just the same, and are just as real.


Online stalking consists of people communicating with you in ways that unsettle you (whether purposefully intended or unknowingly), especially with respect to suggesting or implying that they're watching and noting your every comment and update.;
, They might appreciate the honesty. Rather than trying to appear smug.

, The intent behind the person bothering you matters; clearly there is a difference between friends and family browsing your online information to keep themselves apprised of what you're sharing and a person who targets you specifically, clinging over everything you do and then remarking on it, possibly spooking you.


Research undertaken by University of Missouri Professor Kevin Wisehas demonstrated that healthy wall viewing in Facebook consists of what he terms ""social browsing"", whereby friends and family look at your general news feed and updates, enjoy the read but then move on to other people and activities; in other words, they're simply including you in their circle of friendship. On the other hand, what Professor Wise terms ""social searching"" involves a more concerted action on behalf of the viewer. Here the viewer focuses solely on your wall posts, pictures, updates, etc., and doesn't balance this with viewing other people's Facebook feeds; in other words, this person is behaving as if he or she is obsessed with you.
A ""social searcher"" experiences far stronger emotional reactions in relation to what he or she reads than people merely socially browsing.This suggests that if a Facebook stalker is ""out to get you"" (either to be more a part of your world or to avenge a slight or a break up, etc.), it's possible they'll misconstrue everything you say online into something it isn't.

, Some indicators of Facebook stalking might include (dependent on who the person is and what they're up to):


Is the person failing to leave you alone despite your various requests to stop messaging you, leaving wall comments, or sending you things like links and Farmville gifts?
Are they leaving lots of comments that are suggestive of the two of you spending more time, or even the rest of your lives, together (and they're not your lover or spouse)?
Are you at the receiving end of intimidating language or abusive language (such as cursing or sexually suggestive comments)?
Are you being bullied and/or threatened? For example, has someone been posting unkind, doctored, private, etc., photos of you online (or perhaps of people close to you as well)?
Are you experiencing a case where the person will simply not leave you alone but keeps posting updates, sending messages, and constantly butting in? While not necessarily being nasty, mean, or threatening, doing this constantly tends to reveal obsessive behavior.

, If the person stalking you is chatting with you every time you're online, sending you constant messages in your inbox, is always commenting on and liking all your posts and photos, and is barely leaving you alone, your response can range anywhere from irritation and frustration to finding it unpleasant, difficult to deal with, and overwhelming. Even if these actions are done only occasionally, there can be a problem where anything they've said leaves you feeling pressured, upset by what they've added, or you've asked them to stop contacting you at all but they haven't.


Consider your own feelings before worrying about theirs. Do you feel like someone is stalking you just because of what they're saying or doing? Do you feel as if someone is obsessing over you (either because they really like or really hate you)?
Do you feel overwhelmed, bewildered, annoyed by their constant messaging and posts? This is enough of a reason for you to find a solution that works for you.

, Provided that you don't feel immediately threatened (see step 11), try responding in a graduated way. Realize that there is always the possibility that this person doesn't really understand that what he or she is doing is so upsetting to you. It's recommended that you try to open the lines of constructive communication before taking the issue more seriously. After all, there's no need to cause unnecessary drama in your life because you reacted rudely to the other person or misunderstood their motives, only to end up with them and 10 other people ranting at you about it! Start by assuming the best and simply asking them to stop, keeping in mind that if this doesn't work, you have all the remaining options at your disposal.


Say something like: ""Hey J! Did you realize that you're the only person who leaves me posts and messages every hour? I'm finding it hard to deal with and I'd be really happy if you could cut it back to, say, one post a day instead. Does that work for you?""
Obviously, if the person leaving the messages and notes is a real life close friend, boyfriend or girlfriend, or a family member, it goes without saying that some of these people will leave a lot of messages because it seems the natural thing to do. All the same, they should acquiesce to any requests from you to chill on their excessive messaging and if talking to them doesn't work, speak with other family members or friends to get additional support.

, If they comment on a picture by saying such things as how pretty it is and how you should hang out with them, and how awesome they think you are, etc., just say little; a ""Thanks"" will suffice. If they chat with you and write really long messages just say, ""lol"" or ""ok"" to show that you aren't really interested. Next, proceed to not replying at all to anything this person leaves on your wall and in your message box. For example, if they comment on your statuses just saying, ""lol"" or ""ok"", don't even reply, and they won't have leverage left to keep that comment stream running. In this way, you're giving out subtle hints that you're annoyed by what this person is doing but that you're not going to get involved by replying.

, More obvious hints might cause some people to feel embarrassed enough around mutual friends online to stop. For example, tag them in a post (put the @ symbol and then their name) and say something like, ""I love how (person's name) comments and likes all of my things!"" This is not too rude, but it gives them a clear hint that you've noticed and find it annoying. Hopefully, they'll get the hint. Just be aware that they might also think it's a compliment or a thank you to them.


You might try a wall post: ""Please don't leave comments when I post stuff like X, Y, Z. It's just an update of no consequence!"" It doesn't directly name them but it does make it clear to them that you don't think much of the commenting.
If you can't beat them, join them! This might cure the problem in its tracks. If he or she is a Facebook friend you don't know too well, but who is always commenting and liking your stuff, try commenting and liking all of his or her stuff too. It may well be that this person genuinely digs you and the two of you might just become good friends with shared interests as a result! This step is a twist on the ""don't assume the worst of other people"" step; sometimes it takes changing your perspective and broadening your understanding of using Facebook in order to put things right again. Maybe an online friendship will grow, but only if you try!

, When it really starts to get on your nerves and you've already tried the softly softly approaches, get back to them politely but be firmer this time. Send a chat message or an inbox message and let them know that the constant commenting and messaging is not appropriate, that you'd like them to comment and like your stuff a lot less. For example:


""Hey X! I'm following up my earlier request to you to ease up a little on the posts and messaging. It's really not working for me having you leave so many posts; it's not like I even post interesting stuff worth commenting on half the time. I had hoped you'd understood my request last time and now I'm letting you know that I need you stop doing this. It's not like I'm going to read or respond to what you're adding and it'd be better for both of us if you stopped."" At this point, you can make a choice as to whether or not you will warn them about your intention to block them.

, There are two approaches to this. The first is to warn them that you'll do it and then to follow through if they don't heed your warning within a set period of time. Only do this if you think it'll have an impact and won't make them angry with you. The second response is to simply block them and not alert them – if you've already given enough hints, it'll hardly be a surprise.


You can block a friend by going to your Privacy Settings. Click on the button ""Customize"" and go to ""Posts by Me"". Click on ""Customize"" again and block them from viewing your wall. Read How to delete friends from Facebook for more information on removing a friend.
For people hassling you in general, read How to block people on Facebook for more information.
Read How to block someone in Facebook chat if you want to stop someone chatting to you using Facebook.

, It's important to let friends you trust know what's happening, especially where they're mutual friends with both of you. If they're supportive of you and understanding of the situation, they can either take the same action or they can keep a lookout for the behavior of the blocked person and let you know what's happening. This is important for several reasons – if you took this action because you felt there was no other choice but you're still offline friends, then your other friends can help smooth the waters between the two of you; or, if the blocked person feels offended and tries to retaliate, the more people who can support you and try to help the other person see the error of their ways, the better.


Realize that some obsessive people don't always understand the harm they're inflicting. In some cases, they may even think they've been super friendly or caring, and being blocked can cause them to take this as a personal rejection which might lead them seeking to muddy your reputation if you're not careful.

On the other hand, they may just be someone who really got the wrong end of the stick on how to use Facebook and will apologize when he or she finally ""gets it"".


You may also choose to report them to Facebook as well. This will bring in Facebook's abuse team who have the ability to prevent them from using Facebook, or contact their Internet service provider or local authorities.

, Talk to parents, friends, teachers, counselors, etc., and let them know what you're going through. Actions taken to instill fear or make threats are as real and wrong online as they are offline. This is not something to put up with alone and the sooner you get support and someone else to talk to, the sooner you'll know whether or not the fears are in your own head or whether there really is a situation to be concerned about.


Never let any threats of harm to you or property damage slide. These are police matters and contacting the police immediately is warranted.

Take action as soon as possible if you do fall for a spam link or page.",How to Avoid Facebook Malware," The adage ""if it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't true"" is most applicable on the internet. If you have the slightest about a link or an app telling you that you've won a free iPad or there are embarrassing photos of you being uploaded, don't click on it.Often times, malware will use your Facebook friends to send you links to external websites. Be sure to ask your friend(s) in question if they actually sent the link before opening it.;
, Doing so will provide you with a decent overview of what you can expect Facebook to do (and what they won't do) as far as inquiries about your personal information go.

, If you see a link or application posted by a friend with a sensationalist phrase attached (e.g., ""you won't believe this works until you try it""), their account may be posting spam because of malware. Similarly, intensifiers such as ""wow"" or ""OMG"" are often used in spam posts due to their eye-catching potential.The context of the language here is important, of course. If the friend in question commonly posts in this manner, you have far less to suspect than if your friend is usually straightforward or well-spoken on Facebook.
This concept also applies to messaging within Facebook. If a friend messages you something that seems dissonant with your history or the way they speak, don't open the link.
If you see a friend posting the same link verbatim to several different friends' walls, it's probably spam.

, While malware tends to be disguised, using these simple preventative measures will help you avoid it for the most part:


Logging out of Facebook on shared or public computers
Changing your password often
Accepting friends requests only from people you know
Keeping your login information private

, As per Facebook's terms of use, Facebook employees will never ask for your payment or account information through an app or a message. You should only enter these credentials within the fields to which they pertain (e.g., enter your Facebook password in the ""Password"" field when logging in).

, You can typically trust .gov or .org sites, but watch out for links that start with bit.ly.


Malware usually disguises malicious links as shorter-than-usual links.

, When you add a new app to your page, you'll probably receive a pop-up window asking you to click Allow in order to provide the app with personal details such as your location, first and last name, and date of birth. Unless the app in question is a verified one (e.g., Google, Pandora, Instagram), don't click Allow or you put your account at risk for contracting malware.


Sometimes malware will manifest as a notification that, when clicked, prompts you to allow Facebook access to your personal information. If you click on a notification and are subsequently prompted to click Allow, it's probably malware., There are a few ways you can handle the situation if you find out you've been spammed or are now spamming others:


Remove spam wall posts by either clicking the ""X"" to the right of the post, or marking it as spam via the same drop-down menu.
Review potential malware apps by clicking Settings from the drop-down menu in the top right corner of your page, then clicking Apps. You can delete malware apps and games from here.

Change your Facebook password.
Consider enabling secure browsing via Facebook Security settings.

The second column of buttons sets whether the email address is visible on your profile. An open circle indicates that it's shown on your timeline, and a gray circle with a line through it indicates that it's hidden.

Go easy on the apps.,
Watch your status - try not to put everything you do in there.,
Don't overdo your interests - having 20 million bands on your music interests list shows that you have too much time on your hands.,
Don't overdo the quotes - if you have something your friends said or you said that was witty, put it down, but if you have too many, you may be seen as a gossip.

,
Be honest on your political views.,
Never give out your full birthday.,
Be honest on your relationship status - Do not say if you are In A Relationship unless you have a boyfriend/girlfriend and don't say you are married unless you have a certified marriage license.,

They may be tempting and addicting, but don't add too many, because they will be just a nuisance when it comes to notifications.;
, If there is something you want your friends to hear or something cool happened, put it there. For example, Braves won 7-2 sounds better than I am taking a nap. Also, don't cram your news feed with app junk, unless it is something cool you would like to show all your friends. Try to keep your interests to more hobbies or stuff you want to talk about with other, not random things to get tags.

, Just narrow it down to your all time favorite bands or whatever, or a certain genres. It is Favorite whatever, not everything you like.

,, Keep it blank unless you are a confirmed member of a church or whatever or if you are registered to a certain political party.

, This could be used for identify theft.

, It's Complicated should not be used for crushes.

,, The best pictures are a picture with your best friend or alone doing a hobby of your choice.

, Only post pictures if you really think it's necessary. Unnecessary pictures will get you less likes and people will just get bored of you.

, A camwhore is someone who is always taking pictures of themselves in different effects/filters and poses. Most people hate camwhores. So don't be one!

, Instead of ""Going to the beach. Anyone coming with me?"" make it ""Hitting the beach! Who's gonna join the party with me? We can raid together!"" because it's sounds more interesting and it'll get more Likes.

, Before you sort through your photos, have your mind on a look you're going for. Do you want it to be sexy, mature, professional, fun, sporty, or just plain silly?


There's a fine line between sexy and provocative. Make sure not to make your picture look too illicit or people may get the wrong impression of you.
You can look professional while smiling and showing your fun side.
Sporty photos can be a great way to boast your accomplishments. Just don't pick one that makes you look too sweaty or worn, unless you're really proud of your hard work.
Your photo can include a close friend or family member. Just make sure you stand out in some way so people know which person in the photo you are.
If you want the world to know that you love your significant other, choose a picture of the two of you. However, avoid posting anything too mushy or people may roll their eyes.

, Sort through your existing photos to see which one is best. Some places to look include:


Your treasure trove of Facebook photos. You may be inspired to use an older photo if you're feeling nostalgic or if it's for a special reason.

For example, if it's the holiday season, you may play around with the old photo of you at the ugly Christmas sweater party from the year before.


If you're feeling nostalgic, look through your photo album. Yes, there was a time when you could find photos between the pages of a real book--not Facebook.

If it's Mother's Day, or your father's birthday, post a photo of yourself as a little kid with your family. These photos are a big hits and get a lot of ""likes.""


Your friends' photos. Your closest friends may have captured some great memories while you were hardly paying attention.

, Once you find the photo that gives you the look you were going for, you're almost ready to go.


Sometimes you may not end up with the photo that shows the look you were going for. You don't have to stick to your original plan if something sparks your fancy.
Don't overthink it. Remember that you can change your photo any time you want--and it only takes a minute.

, If none of the photos you have are doing the trick, try your hand at taking a new photo.


Ask a friend or roommate to take a picture of you.
You can also try your hand at a self-pic. Before you do, though, learn how to Take Flattering Photos of Yourself.
It may be easier to use a web cam for the photo, but using a camera may give you a higher-quality photo.

, After you take or find the perfect photo, ask a trusted friend what he or she really thinks. Don't be afraid of the truth.


See if your friend understands what look you're going for in the photo. If you think the photo is mature and your friend thinks you look like you're twelve years old, you may want to try again.
Not everyone has to be pleased with your photo. Your mother, for example, may have a different idea of how you should represent yourself. However, your photo shouldn't be so extreme or provocative that it makes your parents cringe.

Understand the differing focuses between outbound and inbound marketing:



Outbound marketing: In traditional marketing (outbound marketing) companies focus on finding customers.,
Be aware that social media amplifies the impact of your content.,
Think about the manner and type of information Facebook gathers.,
Know which options to use.,
Be aware that both groups and fan pages allow you to do these same things:


Create discussions and others to reply.,
Use groups to organize.,
Use Pages for interaction without connection.,
Regardless of which one you choose (of course, you can have both), be sure to update regularly, keep your audience engaged and offer something of value.",How to Integrate Facebook Into Your Social Media Strategy," The focus in this marketing is often about trying to push products onto people who really don't want the products at all. Technology is making these marketing techniques less effective and more expensive.

Inbound Marketers: Flip outbound marketing on its head. Instead of buying display ads in print publications, they create content that potential customers want to see, create blogs that people subscribe to and look forward to reading, and the focus is on getting found by customers, instead of driving the message into a crowd over and over again like a sledgehammer.;
, When your content is distributed across, and discussed on, networks of personal relationships, it becomes more authentic and nuanced, and it is more likely to draw qualified customers to your site. Social media like Facebook is a successful inbound marketing campaign. Using Facebook can offer you a more targeted advertising approach.

, While Google knows you're in the market for a new home, Facebook knows what causes are important to you, which videos you like to share and how often you make recommendations to your friends. Social media advertising opportunities are yielding better-qualified, return on investment results compared to the Google ad network. Facebook is now able to gather data that it can leverage immeasurably in the world of advertising: the way people think, what they care about and how this leads them to buying decisions.

, Should you use groups or regular pages? While this is a more complicated question than it seems on the surface, it's important to know what you can and can't do with each:



Standard Facebook fan page: A Facebook Page is a public profile that enables you to share your business and products with Facebook users. Not only can you connect with your favorite artists and businesses, but now you also can show your friends what you care about and recommend by adding Pages to your personal profile because ""Jane became a fan of…"" pops up on each person's wall when they become a fan of your business. Pages can be viewed by unregistered users, though you will need to set your security preferences for this.

A viewer does not need to be a Facebook member to view your fan page. You can add extra applications to make your page more personal and send messages to all members using the updates feature. Pages also allow you to see statistics. You can create a corporate ""person"" page.
Log out and see what you can and can't view while not logged in as a registered user. Fan pages can be useful in helping the viral aspect of social media marketing.



Groups: Facebook Groups are set up for more personal interaction. Groups are also directly connected to the people who administer them, meaning that activities that go on there could reflect on you personally. For example, to help people find an online freelancer called ""Freelance Marketplace Community"" where members share experiences, project tips and who's hiring. Pages, on the other hand, don’t list the names of administrators, and are thought of as a person, almost like a corporate entity is considered a ‘person’ under the law.

Groups allow you to send out bulk invitations (for instance, you can ask all of your friends to join the group) and any of your group members can also invite their friends. If you have ""friends"" on your Facebook page who are acquaintances or just share common interests, this is a good way to market. Due to their security features, and size limitations (only groups under 5,000 members can send email blasts).
Another key difference is that Pages are indexed by external search engines such as Google, just like a public profile while Groups are not.



,
Create related Events, which show up under the users’ Request.
Have a wall for people to write on.
Share videos and pictures. Both require you to manually remove posts as an administrator if something does not meet your standards or purpose for the page.

, Groups are great for organizing on a personal level and for smaller scale interaction around a cause.

, Pages are better for brands, businesses, bands, movies, or celebrities who want to interact with their fans or customers without having them connected to a personal account, and have a need to exceed Facebook’s 5,000 friend cap.

, Because even if members have no intention of buying anything on Facebook, the relationships you establish, and community you build there, can benefit your business in countless ways.

Look for the ""Daily Active Users Breakdown"" report.,
Scan down the Users report.,
Analyze your data.",How to Use Daily Active Users in Facebook," Go to your Insights panel and select the ""Users"" report. This is found on the left hand side of the Insights panel.;
, About midway down this report you will find a Daily Active Users Breakdown chart. You will need to hover your mouse above the different statistics in order to find out more information. The information currently available is:


Unique Page Views – This is the number of Facebook participants per day who have actually viewed your Facebook page.
Post Views – Here you will see how many people have viewed your Facebook posts for the day. This number also represents what has been viewed by way of news feeds.
Liked a Post – This amount represents the amount of fans who have liked one of your posts.
Commented on a Post – Obviously, this is the amount of fans who have commented on one of your posts.
Wall Posts – This represents how many fans have posted to your Page, whether it's comments, photos, links, etc.

, Don't try to analyze the data daily. To do so would create a very unrealistic and uneven picture of daily interactions with your Page. Instead, aim to assess the figures weekly and monthly, to get a sense of the trends evolving. Things to bear in mind include:


Page views: A lower number here is usual unless you have a broad group of many fans.
Unique Page views: A higher number here is usual if you have a small fan base.
Liked a Post: A high number here means that there may be something you've added that's worth further investigation and repeating.

Find and attend networking events.",How to Network on Facebook," When you use Facebook for business networking, you need to be cautious of what you upload, post, and share. These things can all be seen by the professionals you are networking with, and can have a negative impact on your professional life.;
, If you decide to start networking professionally on Facebook, take some time to tidy up your profile. Take down any comments or photos that might be incriminating.


Avoid keeping pictures of you drinking or taking drugs. Sexually suggestive photos will also make you appear much less professional.

, While you don't want to turn your Facebook profile into your resume, you should still highlight all of your most important work milestones.

, Create a Professional list that only contains your professional contacts, and a Friends list that includes all of your social contacts. This allows you to set aspects of your profile to only be visible to your social friends. Whenever you add a professional contact, put them in the Professional list.


See this guide for details on creating a new list and adding people to it.

, Once you have a Professional list and a Friends list, you can start blocking off parts of your profile from your professional contacts. Open your Facebook home page and click the ""Edit profile"" link underneath your image.


For every entry in your profile, you can set who can view it. Click the button with the silhouettes in the corner of each item to select who can see the item. Use this to hide any information that you don't want professional contacts to see, but don't care if friends see.
Make sure to do this for any images that you don't want to share with professional contacts as well. Images can be very damaging if they contain content that a company might find objectionable.

, Before you start making new contacts, spend a few minutes tracking down old coworkers and other professional contacts. This can help you build an established network before you start meeting new people.


Click the Friends icon in the Facebook title bar. Click the Find Friends link, and then use the buttons in the upper-right corner to add contacts from various services.

, There are thousands of Facebook groups that appeal to virtually every interest. Find a few that directly relate to your field or area of interest. Use the search bar at the top of Facebook to browse through groups based on your various interests.


Think of keywords that apply to your area of expertise or your professional passions. Use these keywords to search for groups.
Use the filters to narrow your search to specific fields.
You can also find groups by looking at your professional contacts' profiles.

, You want to make sure that you join groups that are active and lively. There are a few things you can check before committing to joining the group:


Recent News — This section is updated by the group's moderators. Check that the information is up to date and not focused purely on self-promotion.
Member List — See how many members the group has, as well as the types of interests they share. This can give you a good insight on the types of people that the group attracts.
Discussion Board — Look at how often people are posting, and the kind of discussions taking place. If they aren't worthwhile discussions, then the group likely isn't worth your time.
Wall Posts — If there's a lot of spam here, then the moderators aren't likely very involved in the group.

, Each time you join a group, post a quick introduction on the Group's wall. Let people know who you are, if you're there to network or find a job, what your interests or specialties are, and if you can provide advice for others.Avoid being too ""spammy"". Don't advertise yourself or your services, don't link to your business's website, and don't try to sell anything during your introduction. Save this for when you are asked for it. You're here to make contacts, not make a sale.

, Link to news articles, blog posts, press releases, and other content that is relevant to the group. Be sure to weigh in in the comments section for what you post. The key is to try to start a discussion, while simultaneously expanding your personal brand.

, Discussions are one of the key functions of Facebook groups. Find and start discussions that relate to your business interests. When replaying to an existing discussion, don't post generic responses. Try to add value to every conversation you participate in. Avoid hostility with others and work to engage your fellow group members in productive discussions.


There will almost always be trolls whenever there is an online discussion. Trolls attempt to undermine discussions by posting comments designed to get under other users' skin. Replying to these users is a waste of your time, and troll comments should be ignored whenever possible.

, You should avoid immediately adding everyone in the group to your Professional list. Instead, wait it out a while and see if you develop a rapport with any other members. Once you've interacted on the group page for a little bit, you can add them to your list.


Make sure that you add them to the Professional list and not your Friends list. If you add them to the wrong list, they will have access to information that you don't want to share.

, Avoid joining every possible group, and focus instead on a few key groups. Take the time to interact regularly with these groups; you will see more results than simply joining a hundred groups and not participating in any of them.

, Once you've gotten to know someone in your group, you can start interacting with them one-on-one. Post interesting content on their wall to try to stimulate some conversation with them. Follow-up on any comments they make on your posts.

, Many professionals will not use Facebook chat, and chat programs in general are typically viewed as less-professional than email. If you want to send a message to a professional contact on Facebook, do your best to format it as close to an email as possible.

, When writing posts, messages, or comments to a professional contact, avoid using emoticons. These are very casual symbols, and should be reserved for chatting with friends.

, When communicating on the internet, your grammar serves as your first impression. Make sure that all of your messages are written clearly and are free of spelling and punctuation errors. Try to avoid exclamation marks.

, While it can be fine to chat with your friends at any time, you should limit your daily correspondence with your professional contacts. If you contact them too often, you may wear out your welcome and come across as desperate. Keep your conversations succinct and on topic.

, If you're setting up a professional Facebook profile, avoid using it to play games. While Facebook games are incredibly popular, they aren't well-suited for professional accounts. The games you play can broadcast to your friends, and can be a big turnoff for other professionals.


If you do want to play games, double-check to ensure that you aren't sharing any updates with your Professional list.

, Don't go overboard and flood your professional contacts' timelines. Try to limit your posting and sharing to a couple times each day. Any more and it will seem like you spend more time on Facebook than you do working, which will turn away most prospective employers and contacts., Taking a stand for what you believe in can prove beneficial to your career, especially if the cause is related to your field. Search for causes like you would search for groups, and Like the pages to associate with them. If it's something you really believe in, you can share the cause's updates with your groups and professional contacts.

, As you start joining some groups, you'll likely start coming across events and meet-ups. Take advantage of these to help propel your networking efforts. Meeting in person is still one of the most important aspects of successful networking, so you'll eventually need to take your networking beyond Facebook.


When attending an event or conference, make sure you have your ""elevator pitch"" prepared. This is a quick blurb about yourself that you can easily repeat to anyone you meet. Mention your education, some previous work experience and any interests. Think of it like a thirty-second resume.
Get comfortable with some small talk. There will most likely be a lot of mingling at your event, which means you'll need to be familiar with how to keep light conversations going. The key to small talk is finding a common interest with the person you are talking with. Look for these similarities when they introduce themselves, and encourage the other person to share.
Think before you speak. Before you open your mouth to respond, take a second to go over what you're about to say. This will help prevent you from stumbling over what you're trying to say, and will also help keep you from putting your foot in your mouth.
Follow up with people you meet. Make sure to get business cards or contact information so that you can follow up with the person later. This can help you continue your networking efforts beyond Facebook.

Feel free to post gimmicky photos.",How to Become Popular on Facebook1," Posts that elicit strong emotional responses, especially those that make people happy, tend to generate the most likes and shares. For this reason, default to fun when writing your posts. Even when you hope to make a political point, for instance, frame your point humorously to the make the post more popular.Keep in mind that posts that elicit negative emotions such as outrage can also be popular in terms of likes, but that positive posts are more likely to be shared.;
, Exciting or awe-inspiring posts can also generate positive emotional responses. For instance, short posts about an incredible experience you’ve had can be popular, as well as links to interesting articles or stories you’ve come across.Examples of scientific articles that tend to interest people include those about recent astronomical discoveries, or research findings on an adorable species of animal.

, Photos reign supreme in terms of popularity. People are more apt to like and otherwise engage with posts that include photos, as compared to posts with videos or just text. Equally important, however, is the quality of the photos. Only post clear images, and consider adding a filter or cropping photos for aesthetic purposes before posting.Always tag other people that appear in the photos you post.
If you’re ever unsure of whether someone in a photo would want it to be posted, check with them first to make sure.

, It’s always worth captioning photos, but less is more in terms of text. Even for posts that don’t include photos, keep the word count low. Posts of around 80 characters tend to be the most popular., Some of the photo posts that get the most attention are admittedly unoriginal. For instance, photos from your travels and photos with celebrities are both especially likely to be popular.Surprisingly, even has-been celebrities pull in some serious likes.

If you have trouble finding it, look just below your profile picture.

, You can find it in between the ""Invites"" and ""Today"" tabs.

, Think carefully before you name your event. The name you pick can influence how many people actually attend and what they expect. Here are some things to consider:


Clarity. The most important thing is that people actually know what they're signing up for.

If it's a party that will be centered around watching a scary movie or a sporting event, make sure people know that they'll be sitting around a television.
If you're celebrating something, like a birthday party or a recent accomplishment, make sure your guests know so they don't feel silly when they show up without congratulating the right person.
Let people know that it's a surprise. Though it's tricky to keep things secret on Facebook, if that's what you're going for, make it clear. For example, you could be throwing a surprise party for your father, who does not have a Facebook account.


Creativity. As long as you're clear, you can find a way to make your event stand out to your guests. Show them that it's not just another birthday party or costume party. In as few words as possible, show them that this will be a must-not-miss event.
Simplicity. Being clear and creative is a plus, but don't overdo it. If you try to hard to tell your guests that you're inviting them to the party of the century, they may be turned off.

, The details can also affect your guests' overall impression of the party. It's important to set the right tone and tell the guests what to expect. Being clear about the details will also keep people from bugging you with a million questions about your party. Here are some things you should do:


Set the tone. If this is a more serious event, let people know to expect that they shouldn't go too crazy.

If you're inviting them to a talk or a lecture, make it clear that they should be sober and respectful.
If you're having an Oscar Party, for example, and really want to watch the show, make it clear that people shouldn't show up if they plan on giggling through the entire thing.
Of course, fun is always allowed, but making your expectations clear will ensure that you can enjoy your own event.


Tell people what to wear. If it's just a casual house party, you don't have to make a note of it, but if you want people to look more formal for a special occasion, let them know so they're prepared.

If you'll be spending some of the party outside where it's chilly, or if you may take a dip in your pool, tell them to bring coats or bathing suits just in case so they don't feel left out.


Tell people what to bring. If it's a BYOB or a pot-luck, make sure everyone is in the know so they don't show up empty-handed and feel inadequate.

This will also ensure that you have enough supplies for everyone. You don't want to make a beer run during your own party.
If you really want people to bring stuff to your party, don't be shy about it. Don't say, ""Bring drinks or snacks if you want,"" because people may get lazy and not bring anything, and then you'll end up shelling out lots of cash that you didn't intend to spend.
If it's a potluck, you can ask people to post what they're bringing, so there is a variety of food and no one brings the same thing.
If it's a charity event or another event where donations are strongly recommended, let your guests know so they don't foolish when they show up with an empty wallet.


Tell them how important it is to RSVP. If you're having a house party or making a dinner reservation and the head count is really important, let your guests know.

A lot of people don't RSVP because they assume you know they're going, and some people tend to RSVP when it's likely they won't make it.



, Be clear about where you'll be meeting up. Give the exact address of the destination. If it's at your house and your guests have all been there before, give them the address just in case.


If you're not comfortable with putting your address on Facebook, you can give it to your guests through email or texting.
Tell your guests if it's important for them to show up on time. If you're throwing a surprise party or singing at a concert, their promptness is crucial to the success of your event.
If your event will have multiple venues, then let your guests know where you will be when. For example, if you're starting off at your house but then going to a bar, tell them when and where to go.

If you have multiple locations for your event, know that things may not go as planned, so tell your guests to text you if they're late so you can tell them where you are.



, Being clear about the date and time is crucial for throwing a good party. Use the calendar to pick the right date, and tell your guests when the party will start.


Make sure your party doesn't start so early that things die down at the wrong time. If you start the party too late, however, then guests may be too tired to show up.
Look around Facebook to make sure your party isn't conflicting with other parties that many of your guests may be attending.
Check the calendar to make sure your party isn't on a major holiday, sporting event, or TV viewing event. This may discourage other guests from coming.

, The key to a great event is a solid guest list. As you invite your guests, it's important to consider who you want to be there as well as who you want to avoid. Keep in mind the following:


Invite people who you think would actually come. There's nothing more annoying than being invited to an event along with 600 other people, especially if the event is on the other side of the country.
Consider location. Pick friends who are in your area.
Consider your relationship with the person. Make sure you know the person well enough to invite them to a social event.
Have a manageable guest list. If you invite your thousand closest friends, the people you really want to see may not make it. On the other hand, if you invite ninety people to your house party, and too many of them show up, that can be a problem too.

However, if you're publicizing something like your own book reading or rock concert, invite everyone! This will help get your name out there.


Consider who you don't want to invite. You may love hanging out with your coworkers, but they might not quite gel with your other friends. You may have a close friend who you love one-on-one, but he may end up offending or annoying too many of your guests. Only invite the guests that you think will get along.
Have a variety of guests. Invite people who may not know each other and who come from different walks of life. If you think they'll get along, this can make for a great party.

However, if your guests are so varied that they have nothing in common, or if none of them know each other, you may spend your time struggling to get your friends to connect.


If there's someone you really, really don't want to invite who can ruin the party, you may want to keep the event off Facebook. Though there are privacy settings, that person may find out about the event and can either ruin the party or be really hurt.

, It's important to choose the right privacy setting for your party.


Open to the public. This is the most casual option. If anyone is welcome and you're not shy, then feel free to tell the world!
Open to friends of guests. This is a bit more open, and leaves the option for friends of friends to tag along. If you don't care if a few extra people come, then this is the best option. You may end up making new friends at your own event.
Invite only. This is the most private option and the easiest way to ensure that only the people you really want to see will show up. However, remember that it's hard to keep things truly private over the Internet.

, Now you can sit back and see who is attending, and what your guests have to say about the party.

Respond.",How to Write Good Status Updates on Facebook," Instead of repeatedly telling people how boring work is, or how much sleep you've yet to catch up on, it's best to leave information that's a little out of the ordinary. Try to:



Be witty;
Find interesting ways of phrasing what you'd normally say without over-thinking it - for example, instead of saying ""I just ate a calorie-laden muffin"", say ""My svelte body deeply regrets that muffin"";
Word updates as if they're news headlines, or opening lines aimed at drawing in the reader for more; and
Keep them short.;
, Whether it's your own good news or the good news of a friend, most of us enjoy reading the positive, uplifting news. There's enough bad news out there already without your status updates adding to it.


Find things that make people laugh - good jokes, funny stories, hilarious anecdotes
Find things that make people smile - happy photos, sweet sayings, friendly banter.

, Either of these two approaches can help to draw in people who like to give their advice, opinions, or ideas. It can spark off a two-way conversation that can last for days. And often, it's interesting for others to learn from too. The key guidelines are brevity, ease of reading and answering, and interesting topics. Also, multiple choice questions can be a great way to draw people in because they're easy.


Use pop/short quizzes or surveys/polls to get people answering and sharing their thoughts. Facebook has a questions feature that makes it easy for you to add a poll. Try to avoid the polls that ""data mine"" and make it easy for identity theft (like those that ask what your first pet's name was, what your mother's maiden name is, what street you grew up on, and other questions that are typically security questions).
Ask for tips. You don't know how to do something or you just plain don't know something? Use your Facebook Page to ask for the answer! Use this as a chance to ""share experiences"".Ask questions with an edge to them, like ""Do you live near a nuclear power station?""Use ""fill-in-the-blank"" questions. Make sure you use the term ""Fill in the blank"" at the commencement of your post.
Avoid questions that require too much thinking. It should be as easy as ""What's your favorite color"" in terms of being able to answer fast. In terms of closed versus open-ended questions, there is a divergence of opinion. Social media expert John Haydon says closed questions (that elicit yes or no answers) are fine on Facebook because nobody wants to chew up time answering in long ways.On the other hand, that shuts down the chance for interesting comments, so it's best to try a little of each, while ensuring that your open-ended questions are short and easy.
Be careful asking for too many details; be specific rather than general in your question. For example, asking people what they do to reduce their carbon footprint might encourage your die-hard fans to leave a response but everyone else will think ""whoa, too big a question"" and move on., If there is a beautiful photo, it'll be hard to resist checking it. If there's an appeal for a cause, a lot of people will take time to check it out. And links - if they're good, topical, and regular, you'll have friends clicking on them and leaving comments and likes.


Photos are great for sparking comments. Ask a question about the photo, such as whether people like it, or if they know where/what it is a photo of. Or ask people what's wrong about the picture if you're dealing with a provocative issue.

, If you can inject a little intrigue and unknown into your updates, it might encourage your friends to ask ""Hey, what's going on?!"" Be careful though, the mystery touch can really annoy the more cynical, ""been-there-done-that"" crowd. If you want to use this method, tease your friends with messages about:


5, 4, 3, 2, day countdowns

Secret information
Knowledge of hidden objects whereabouts that you're not telling
Strange illness leaks that you or someone else has... ""Oh I am dying"", ""Oh, I can barely breathe...""
Don't make the explanation long-winded though.

, Oddly, the people sitting around online all day aren't being that adventurous but they are clinging to the hope someone else is. If you're adventurous and you really are skydiving, pole vaulting, or base jumping, get on once in a while and tell your friends. It'll brighten up their day–dramatically–and perhaps remind them that there is more to life than being hooked to status updates all day.

, There are some topics guaranteed to get a response:


Music, that is bands, songs etc.
Chocolate
Current disasters

Current sports events
Seasonal changes and what to do for summer, winter activities
A cause you're clearly passionate about (some of your friends will have followed you for this very reason)

Gifts you've given or received
Things you should be doing instead of letting Facebook time-suck you.

, Search for topics such as ""funny Facebook updates"", or ""best Facebook updates"", etc., if you need inspiration or you're completely lost for ideas. You can ""borrow"" someone else's ideas until the creative flow starts on its own account.

, Status updates should be short bursts of brilliance – the less you think about them, the better they’ll be.

, Facebook is about interacting and being responsive. When people reply to your updates, it's not only polite to acknowledge their interest but it can also take things to a new level if you continue to interact about a particular topic and you never know what you might learn or what good might come from it!

Let it be.",How to Teach Facebook to Seniors," It doesn't matter what age you are – you can learn technology. The real barrier is likely to be attitude – the younger generations believing that there is no point teaching older generations Facebook, and in turn, the elderly believing there is no point being a part of such online social networking.


Focus on the reality that many senior people care deeply about any method of communication that will enable them to remain connected with their family, friends, and other people they care about.The convenience, accessibility, and low expense of online interaction provides adequate motivation to try something new like Facebook provided you explain the purpose and benefits adequately.
Focus on making it clear that there is nothing magical or strange about Facebook. Have clear explanations ready.
Bear in mind that older adults tend to be persistent, patient, and enjoy seeking out intellectual stimulation.In addition, elderly people tend to be just as curious as kids.Take these positive traits and apply them to your Facebook training.;
, Unless you've been specifically asked by your elderly friend how to use Facebook, this may be your biggest hurdle. If you're trying to get granddad convinced to have a Facebook account, you're likely to be asked: ""But what do I want to do that for? What's it do for me that I don't already have?"" And because all adults need to know why they need to learn something and are most attentive when the learning is of immediate value and relevancy,you'll have to take a deep breath and come up with some persuasive reasons, such as:


""It's a great way to find old buddies!"" – Explain to your senior friend how easy it is to catch up with long lost friends. Many elderly people are reconnecting with long-lost friends via Facebook.If you have any examples, provide them, especially if they involve elderly people.
""It's a way that you can keep in touch with me and the rest of the family!"" – Show your senior friend photos, status updates, and other family information that they can tap into and keep abreast of as family grows, travels, achieves successes, etc.
""X celebrity uses it!"" – Name their favorite celebrity, politician, poet, author, sportsperson, etc., and show them his or her account. Explain how they can be a fan of this person on Facebook, such as Susan Boyle.""You don't need to remember anyone's email, let alone email them!"" – Show how they can keep up with friends just by using Facebook.
""You can get free deals, specials, etc., from your favorite stores and companies!"" – Show them how they can find vouchers, coupons, special deals etc., by becoming fans of certain company sites.
""You can play games on Facebook!"" – Take the time to show them games and apps like Farmville on Facebook that might pique their curiosity.Growing numbers of seniors are enjoying Facebook games, which has the added benefit of exercising the brain and hand muscles.""Facebook can narrow the generation gap.""- Throw this one in to show you think granddad's as hip as you!

, Facebook can be pretty confusing to master for people who are new to social networking, whatever their age. If you have an account on the site, log in and give your senior friend a visual overview of how to get started, using your account as an example. Work through it slowly and methodically and be patient. If you need to go over things again, do so.


Repeat what you're showing them, take it slowly, and stop after every few explanations to give them hands-on practice.If you're getting frustrated, either take a break, or suggest that they can contact you whenever they strike a problem or have a question rather than repeating things too many times. Older adults learn best by ""doing"" and it might be a good idea just to go and get a cup of coffee and read a magazine in the background while they play around with it for a bit.
Don't use Facebook or online jargon without explaining it. For example, instead of going on about having a good avatar, be sure to say something like: ""It's really important to make sure you have a clear photo on your profile page. A photo is usually known as an avatar. People look to see your photo or avatar to work out whether or not they know you."" Keep in mind that all online related words you use must be translated to more commonly known words until your senior friend is used to the new terms.

, Many seniors aren't comfortable with sharing so much information about themselves. Facebook might not be for them, but maybe diaspora is.

, If your granddad is only doing this to humor you, it's probably a waste of time. Ask if the person you're helping is able to spend a little time now and then answering messages and friend requests from old buddies. The reactions you receive to your persuasive reasoning outlined above should help you to work out their level of likely ongoing active interest.

, Adjust volume and font size if necessary, before starting. Ensure that your senior friend has a valid email address before signing up; it's required and it's useful for receiving notifications of messages, friend requests, events, and so on, outside of Facebook. If they do not have an email address, create one for free using providers such as Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. Have them fill in all the required fields when creating the Facebook account, and if they're uncomfortable providing personal information, show them how to customize their privacy settings as you go.


Reassure them about their privacy settings. Explain the settings thoroughly to make sure that they know what is and is not searchable by other people online. Respect the extent of privacy they wish to enforce.
Don't be afraid to print out the account steps in large print. Allowing older adults to read the instructions and explanations on paper can be reassuring and can help the learning and recognition process to activate more quickly.

, An email address and birthday is pretty bare for a Facebook profile - help them add information such as their current or former place of employment, old high schools or colleges, likes and interests, contact information, and more. Remember, only provide the information they are comfortable giving out and that the accessibility of all information can be adjusted with ""Privacy Settings"".

, This is a great way for them to reconnect with old friends, relatives, coworkers, employees, classmates, etc.

, Everyone can learn from what senior citizens have to share. Encourage your senior friend to open up and share stories, thoughts, ideas, and wisdom with others on Facebook.


If your senior friend really takes to Facebook, help him or her gain a wider following of friends by telling your friends and liking and sharing their updates.

, The wisdom of people who have lived many decades is irreplaceable and intensely valuable. If your newly Facebook converted senior friend makes pertinent comments about using the site, the way people are using the site, or even your seeming addiction to it, then maybe they're onto something. Keep your ears open to learn from their wise perspective about a modern way to do something humans have always done - keeping in touch.


Have a cup of something together and ask your senior friend what his or her thoughts about Facebook are. Ask questions and find out if there are any ways you can help to enhance their experience of being on Facebook. And remember to have a good laugh to relieve the tension built up from learning a new skill.

, If you've tried and your senior friend has been polite but displays a total lack of interest the moment you turn your back, be understanding. It isn't necessarily because they're older – it's probably because they're a lot wiser about how they'd like to use their time, and it's just not for them. Stick with the tried and true methods of keeping in touch through phone calls and turning up now and then.

Post things your Facebook friends will want to share.,
Make posts during hours of high Facebook use.,
Challenge friends to interact with your posts.,
Tag folks as much as possible.",How to Become Popular on Facebook2," In order for your posts to be as popular as possible, they have to do more than impress your friends. Your friends are more likely to share your post if they think it will impress their friends too. Accordingly, think about how to appeal to your friend’s friends.For instance, word your posts in a way that is accessible to as many people as possible.
Instead of using language that is specific to just your social group, for instance, use language that you can imagine your friends would use in their own social circles too. This will make people more likely to share your post instead of reinterpreting it.

, On weekdays, Facebook traffic is highest during the after work and early evening hours. That said, the most traffic of all occurs on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Posts during these times are likely to get the most interaction.Your particular friend group may be more active at different times than the norm, so do a bit of experimenting to see when your posts get the most traction and get in the habit of making posts at this time.
For instance, young adults may be more active later in the evening. If most of your friends are of a certain age, think about the time of day they are most likely to be checking Facebook and make your posts accordingly.

, Asking questions or soliciting advice is a great way to get interaction with your posts. You can do so in the interest of humor, or when you’re in need of actual information. You can even ask a question in a humorous manner than can still wind up with good advice from your friends.For instance, post something like, “Anybody else sick of paying for oil changes?” Not only will you get a bunch of agreement, your friends that know of good deals on oil changes, or that may even know how to teach you to change your own oil, will likely chime in too.
More casually, you can solicit interaction by providing something for people to do. For instance, write a fill in the blank post, such as “The weirdest combination of foods I eat together is _____ and _____.”

, One of the best ways to generate interaction and popularity is by getting specific people’s attention. Accordingly, tag the friends you think are most likely to interact with your posts, or that may have the most helpful advice or interesting commentary to add."
"
Like and share other users' content.,
Join or create groups.,
Make helpful posts.,
Default to timely content.,
Don’t post too often.",How to Become Popular on Facebook3," You’ve heard the adage about scratching each other’s backs. This may be even more true in the virtual world. The more you like and share other people’s posts, the more likely they are to interact with your posts as well., Joining or creating groups can help you get in touch with people that have a shared interest. In turn, you’ll have access to a targeted network of users that you know you can appeal to with certain types of posts. Furthermore, posts from other people in the group will provide you with information that you can feature or comment on in your own posts., Posts that educate people can get a lot of likes and shares. This is especially true when you share something that may be immediately pertinent to your friends' lives. For instance, make a post about a new app you’ve been using, and briefly mention how it’s made your life easier., Comments on recent or current events should be as fresh as possible. It will boost your popularity if you’re ahead of the curve regarding developments that people in your friend network are interested in. Further, get in the habit of offering your brief perspective on things when posting media items - and address specifically what you like or don’t like about something you’re posting., Posting too frequently can actually decrease your popularity on Facebook, as people may unfollow you (even if they stay friends with you), and never see your posts at all. Limit yourself to two daily posts as a general maximum. Once a day is probably better, especially if you time the post well."
"
Create a Facebook fan page.,
Click ""Suggest to Friends"".,
If you're a fan of other Facebook pages, add your comments and links on their status updates as often as reasonable.,
Use contests for people who become your fans.,
Place your Facebook link on other social media networks.,
Promote your Facebook page in real life.,
Add the ""Facebook Like"" tools to your website or blog.,
Keep your page worth visiting.,
Become part of an external social media networking community.,
Hire a community manager.,
Never miss an opportunity to promote your Facebook page for free.,
Buy advertising.,
Keep learning and stay genuinely interested in your fans.",How to Get More Fans for Your Facebook Page," This is, obviously, a necessary step if you haven't already created one. What might not be so obvious to people or businesses new to social media is that the fan page and ""liking"" is a relationship-building marketing tool with great potential.


Try to grasp early on that your Facebook business page is your ""brand"". Even if you're not a company, business, entrepreneur, cause, etc., you're still developing a brand as an individual or hobbyist ""social media expert"", even if unwittingly so. As such, it's important to plan the page's appearance and content in some detail, including the image that you want to project from the outset. If you already have a fan page but you're not thrilled by the image you're currently projecting, now is the time to fix it!;
, Once your Facebook fan page is published (or refurbished if needed), it's time to spread it as much as possible through your actual friends. If they accept your invitation to ""like"" your fan page, these will be your first ""fans"". Try to think of as many people as possible who you know, to begin with. If you have work colleagues, supporters of whatever it is you're doing (such as running a charity, starting a website, blog readers, etc.), ask these people too.


Do spell it out concisely and politely that you'd appreciate it if they clicked ""like"" on your fan page. Not all people are clued in about what to do after they've clicked on the URL!
Build on your friends' contacts. Ask your friends to suggest your page to their friends as well, both on Facebook itself and through any other methods they're comfortable with (such as Twitter or by email). Word-of-mouth and genuine friendship trust can be used to your advantage to obtain ""friends of friends"" who will possibly have similar interests to yours or will be thrilled to start following your page if you're a business or cause.
If any of your good friends are highly influential on Facebook, ask them if they mind inviting their friends to become fans of your fan page. You can return the favor many times over by highlighting them now and then on your increasingly popular fan page!
Try emailing friends who don't seem to be on Facebook already. This might be their first encouragement to join!

, You'll most likely get the best results by posting your comments to pages with hundreds of thousands or even millions of fans, and by being one of the first to comment on updates made on those pages. Don't overdo your links, however; keep it to a reasonable amount or you'll risk annoying people.


Post a link to your Facebook fan page on other Facebook groups or pages. This is another way of attracting more fans. If you'd like, add a short explanation about the page with the link. Again, do this with care and not too frequently.
Use ""@reply"" (similar to the ""@"" function in Twitter), to tag a person on your Facebook page. Whenever you do this, your note appears on the page of the person or company whose name accompanies the ""@reply"". It's important not to overdo this though or you'll be pulled up for ""spamming"". And if you're a business, don't be surprised if a competitor does it back to your page; smile it off, as it's all part of the social media game!

, Have your fans win something, whether it's a cyber-award you bestow on them, or a real, tangible product or service from your company, such as an eco-bag, a free dog wash, or a can of vanilla roasted peanuts. Try doing this fairly regularly, such as weekly or monthly.



Photo tag: Ask each winner if they wouldn't mind uploading a photo of themselves holding the item if they win something tangible, and ask them to tag themselves in the photo they've uploaded. This is a cool way of encouraging them to spread the word; many fans will do this because they'll be excited and grateful. These photos appear on your Facebook page in a ""Fan Photos"" folder (you could term it your ""winner's"" club, a page for others to see and aspire to!) and the tagged photos also appear in their own stream, encouraging their friends to check out your page. (It doesn't have to be a product they take a photo of; it can be a photo doing something that's related to your site, blog, or fan page, such as cooking a recipe or grooming a dog, etc.).

, For example, use your Twitter address link box to place your Facebook page URL rather than a site address. If you have a lively Twitter account, curiosity will cause a lot of your Twitter followers to click and follow through to your Facebook page. Whatever community you join, always be sure to include a link back to your Facebook page so that curious readers can find and connect with you there.


Use a Social Media Management tool to synergize activity across other social networks. Use a third party program such as Hootsuite or Seesmic to make it easier to manage this. Be careful using direct messages to send your Facebook link; more and more people are wary of ""automated messages"" as they feel that you're not being genuine using these. Try to add a personal touch to show you wrote it for them personally.
Be sure to share other people's Facebook updates too. This will create a reciprocal relationship that encourages them to share your Facebook updates with their followers and fans.
Use photo sites such as Flickr as a way to add your Facebook link. Upload some great photos worth viewing and include your Facebook URL as part of the description, such as ""For more great shots or information, see XXX"".
Whenever you add information about yourself to a user or contributor page on a social community site, include the Facebook link.

, There are many ways you can promote your Facebook page in real life. More often people notice about your Facebook page in real life, the chances of them visiting and liking your Facebook page increases

Display your Facebook page contents live in your store television; it is like a Facebook TV (brandwand by thefunage.com)
Print your Facebook page url and stick it in your store
Print your Facebook page url in the receipts or notices that you hand over to your customer

, Using the ""like"" buttons or boxes makes it easy for people to find your fan page and to ""like"" it from your site or blog. Add it to your site or blog, preferably toward the top so that it's clearly visible. While the button is handy for sitting above posts or articles, having the box to one side is great because it shows real faces of the people who have already liked your Facebook page, and will include the statistics on people who are already your fans for potential new fans to learn about.


To add the Facebook Like box to your website: To add a Facebook Like Box to your website or blog: Go to your Facebook page and click on ""Edit Page"". Look for ""Promote Your Page"" and click on ""Promote with a Like Box"". Choose the height and width of the box as it will appear on your site. Tinker around for the best settings. Among the choices, it's helpful to use ""Show Stream"" and ""Show Header"" because this lets people see what you're posting to your Facebook page and they can click through immediately. Choose ""Get Code"" and insert the iFrame or XFBML code on your site or blog.

, People will be more inclined to keep visiting and to share your content if you maintain regular, interesting, and updated content. And you want them sharing that content, so ensure that it's the type of content people love to share, such as photos, photo sets, videos, and links to really interesting articles (including how-to's).


If possible, think of ways that you can create exclusive content that only gets published on your Facebook page – this means adding links and information that only shows up on your Facebook page and not on your site or blog. For example, perhaps you have recipes, news updates, or links you'd like to share with your fans that you're not sharing on your site or blog. This is a real incentive for people to like your Facebook page and follow it regularly; your readers will grow to look forward to the exclusive updates and will spread the word for you (see ""Tips"" for ""fan only"" content).
Use surveys, quizzes, interesting anecdotes, quotes, etc., to draw in interest. Don't just plug your own product, service, or interest – be generous in diversifying what you're sharing with your fans and they'll reward you by sharing the content, which in turn encourages others to join your page.
Regularly ask questions to elicit comments. People commenting on your page is gold dust. Their comments show up in their stream for their friends to read, again serving as an indirect incentive to get new fans. Besides which, comments help to create a solid sense of community on your Facebook fan page and show new fans that it's worth sticking around (and that you're a friendly and timely responder!).
Learn what balance works best for those following you. Keep an eye on the Facebook statistics to see how many readers stop following you, or block the reading feed. Too many doing either of these activities can be a sign that you're updating too frequently or your content is off course.
Equally, don't let your account stagnate; if you're heading off on a 6 week cruise, have regular input fed into a third party program such as Hootsuite, ready to upload regular content for you while you're away. Suddenly popping up again out of the blue can cause people to unlike your page because they'd forgotten you existed and no longer have the same level of ""trust"" or interest in your page.

, There are a number of social network communities springing up that do nothing else but support one another's social media pages and links in return for you doing the same for all the members. This can be a highly beneficial way of getting trusted people who might be have completely different business, hobby, or personal interests from your own but who are willing to support you because you belong to their community of trust. With such a network of people spreading your Facebook fan page link around, you'll gain more fans. Just be sure to return the favor.

, If your page starts to grow enormously and you don't have time for it, find someone who does. This is vital for a company or business page, as regular and consistent connecting with fans is necessary. Plus, you'll gain helpful information from having a community manager analyze the statistics of your fans and their responsiveness.


Be sure that the person employed to be your community manager has familiarity with Facebook; if not, have them trained before unleashing them as they'll find it easier faster.
Task this person with building and keeping relationships with the fans. Relationships cannot be automated; they must be earned and maintained. This includes answering or responding to comments left on your fan page, dialoguing with regular or ""power commenters"" (including following and sharing their other social media input), giving people information, stories, opinions about things that are of real interest in your area or industry and not just promoting your own product or services, and now and then being talking openly to people about what you're doing in your company or business. Even the occasional humble ""well, this didn't work!"" update can tighten your fan allegiance as they see your honesty too. And always respond quickly to complaints.All of this interactive responsiveness provides a sense of connection for your fans, and if you're doing this really well, you'll find your readers start to bounce back ideas and opinions, that you can learn and benefit from too.

, There are several ways that you can be sure to get across the message that you have a Facebook page worth visiting and ""liking"":


Whenever you write anything online, try to insert a link to your Facebook page. Naturally, don't do this where it'd be considered spamming or overkill but use it wherever it's appropriate, such as at the end of a blog post, in a forum post, or as part of an article explaining what you're mission is all about, etc. If you're a guest blogger, ask the blog owner you're posting on if they'd mind introducing you with a link to your Facebook page.
Tell anyone in your team, company, or partnership to remember to remind people to visit your Facebook page whenever they give a speech, presentation, or talk.
Add a link to your email signature line. In addition, add it to anything you email out to site or blog followers, such as e-books, newsletters, updates, etc.
Add a link to social bookmarking sites.
If you own a shop or store, make sure you let your customers know you're on Facebook. You may display your Facebook URL or include a QR Code that links to your page.

, This can be helpful where you're a company, business, or someone who sees the benefit of spending a little to gain a wider reach for your Facebook page. Even some hobbyists can see the benefit in doing this if they're considering trying to make a living from blogging or running a website online.


Let Facebook advertise your page. If you're willing to pay a fee, Facebook will promote your page and help attract more fans. It's a good idea to promote something that is recent, updated, and hopefully reflective of things happening currently. When tied to current events or news, people will be more likely to want to view your page. For example, say a major magazine or newspaper had just run an article on a renowned celebrity getting sorted after being bankrupt. Write a Facebook fan page post about dealing with bankruptcy and put in associated keywords, with perhaps an image. When Facebook suggests you ""promote"" the post, click on ""Promote"". You'll now see the cost per impressions (CPM), and you can tweak the keywords if needed. Make a decision as to whether you think the cost is worth it, along with the length of time for advertising; if it's worthwhile in your estimation, go for it. It might even be worth running it just to see how many fans you gain as a result. And those fans who ""liked"" your page as a result will have their ""like"" showing to their friends, so you'll likely gather up some more people even after your advertising ends.
Buy Google ads that drive traffic direct to your Facebook page.
Place ads in local newspapers, newsletters, magazines, or even TV if you own a company.

, Facebook continues to evolve, as do your own strategies and needs for your fan page and your related online business or hobby pursuits. Keep in mind the following important points as you continue to build your fan page:

Building a fan base takes time and dedication. It requires constancy and consistency, as well as ensuring that you're also reciprocating the efforts of the fans who are actively supporting you and sharing the information and updates you're providing. If you're patient and persistent, you will build a reputation as a trusted Facebook ""brand"" and you'll start being noticed as a good performer worthy of discussion in broader social media circles, not just in relation to your product or service. There is nothing more exciting than finding out you've hit someone else's blog or article as an example of how to relate well on social media!
As upgrades and changes are made, keep up with them and try to be one of the first to either use them or critique them. This sort of knowledge is looked upon with respect by those yet to adopt changes, and you can easily become a leader in setting a new trend. That will definitely get you new fans. It can also help to ensure that you don't fall afoul of spamming or annoying other Facebook users by not keeping up with changes that are implemented to stop anyone misusing Facebook with too many marketing strategies, and knowing that well in advance is a good thing for your ""brand"".

,
Navigate to the importation page.,
Look for the area near the left side of the resultant page that is listed several lines below the ""Import from a File"" labelled line and click it's Browse button.,
Find your file of the CSV spreadsheet and click the Open button to extract the file name into the system.,
Click the ""Import Books"" button.

,
Go back to your ""My Books"" page and look for your ""success"" message.,
Check your list of ""My Books"" from the My Books tab on the navigation bar.",How to Import Books to Shelve Into Your Goodreads Account," Among a few types, Goodreads can read CSV, XLS and TXT files- most of which can be prepared in a spreadsheet or super-simple text editor file. (Some differences do exist, and will be explained below.);
,, That way, the saves much later will be less annoying and take less time. An empty file at first will make the initial save much easier to complete and subsequent saves almost equally fast throughout.


For Microsoft Excel 2003 and 2007 versions, the CSV format will be available if you scroll down quite a bit and is in the list
For Microsoft Excel 2010, 2013 and 2016, you'll have three types that are widely shown; click the ""CSV (comma delimited)"" format type.
For other super simple text editors you might need to select the ""All file types"" and type in the (dot)CSV file name extension following the file name.
Remember the path you are using to save your file. You'll need this path later when trying to import the books.

, There are some key differences between creating one on a Excel spreadsheet versus creating one in a super simple text editor, though the data that must be present will be the same. The import files must contain at the bare minimum a column of ISBNs or ASINs (or a mix of both, dependent on the types of book you'd like to import (hardcover and paperback under the ISBN number and ASIN for Kindle eBooks)).


For spreadsheet users: Begin to list in a column (potentially column A) all the ISBN's from all the books you're looking to import. You can add a column header, if you want, but these should be the only set of numbers that can exist in the file you are creating.
Make sure that the data format these numbers are being saved as are saved as ""text"" and not numbers or something else weird, otherwise you may end up with cells that look a bit like scientific notation in a spreadsheet that the importer tool can't understand correctly, despite the data saving correctly behind the scenes.

Do not include any symbols such as the hyphen in your ISBN columns.
If you are listing from a spreadsheet, you must type in a column header with ""ISBN"" as your column name for the rest of the file to read and track the changes.


For simple text-editors: For those having to use a simple text editor, list each book's ISBN or ASIN singly, followed by a comma and a space without writing any other information or column headers signifying what this data is replicating.


, If you skip a line, all book data rows following the broken-whitespace line will not be imported. Goodreads is strict on not having this broken line in the resultant spreadsheet that it imports.

, It doesn't matter what you type thereafter, as long as you don't type any other sets of numbers that are 10 or 13 digits long. Sometimes, even another single digit column with numbers can throw the importer for a loop - such as a quantity. It only needs columns for the ISBN or ASIN.

, If Goodreads doesn't happen to have the books on hand in their database when you go to import, you'll be held responsible for adding the books to the database, so this doesn't happen the next time someone else goes to add the same book.


(This is something that no one wants to happen when importing, so perhaps you might want to search before you import to see if you can find the titles of the books and hope that the ISBNs show up in the end result.) However, if Goodreads finds duplicates of the same book that you already have on one of your shelves, no problem, it'll skip that listing and move forward with ""no ill effects""

, This is crucial; You don't want to loose all of your work now.


Double-check the file extension, if you are saving your work in a super simple text editor - some will save them as .csv.txt instead of the required CSV file name extension files. The browse button will not see these weirdly formatted files as uploadable files and will discard whatever is in there until you provide a working file that is understands.
If it has the extended TXT portion on it's file format extensions, you'll need to remove the .txt portion from the file type and you should be ready from there. However, only a few of these text editors still exist, so you shouldn't need to worry if you only operate current systems without many of these clunky third party programs (with the exception of spreadsheet programs such as Excel or OpenOffice).

,, Click the ""My Books"" link on the top navigation bar to the site and click the ""import/export"" button from near the left hand side of the page.

, However, this button will be labelled differently, dependent on your web browser you choose to use when you import these books (Sometimes it will be called ""choose file"" instead of ""Browse"".) If you've scrolled down until you eyes noticed ""import from a Web Page"", you've went a tiny bit too far (this line will be directly above this labeled line.

, You'll still have to click one more button to import the list of books.

,, It should be there. If not, check for this status at the very bottom of the list on the import/export page listing how many were imported since last shelf clearing and see if it had to skip any for obvious reasons.


If you don't want this totals list listed on your account, you will have to Remove all the books on your account with their ""Remove all books"" method that exists on this import/export page, but that seems a bit too tedious if you don't want to loose your books that you potentially just imported. You won't get any reprieve if you used a disk cleanup-like program to clear these statistics out - since Goodreads doesn't store any information of these statistics behind the scenes.

You're best bet is just to let the numbers of imported books increase and not to worry about what that page says below the ""import"" box.



, Look under the ""read"" shelf to find these imported books. You can later move them to their other component shelves, if you'd like, but they are put here at first.

Open and login to the Goodreads website in your web browser.,
Become a Goodreads Librarian if you haven't already done so.

Search for the book that needs combining.,
Open up the book page of one of the books.,
Click the ""Combine"" link on the line of links that also include ""All Editions"" and ""Add a New Edition"".,
Scroll down the list to find of books by the same author (this list will display all the books by the same author).,
Scroll down to the end of the page and click the ""Combine Editions"" link.

Exit back out to the book profile page and view the list of combined book edition to ensure no mistakes have been made in the process.

",How to Combine Book Editions for a Book in the Goodreads Database As a Goodreads Librarian,";
,, Look for two exact duplicates in the search bar. On top of making sure that both titles have exactly the same author listed on the book profile page, Goodreads also wants you to make sure that several other things make it combinable; consider whether they are different publication dates of the same book, different formats of the book (most common reason for combining book pages), and translations of the book into other languages.


The guidelines for this task are indicated on the combine page for the book itself, as all URLs for combine pages are different.

, As long as the primary author is the most common formatting on the list, you can be sure that you've picked the best one to use for your base combination page. If not, you have the right to change the author on the profile page to the most common formatting and most widely researched copy of the book.

, If you don't see this line listed under the book's back cover data, you might need to click the ""More details"" link to list this line.

, Click the checkboxes to the left of the two book in the set that need to be combined. There could be other books inside the set already, but those you needn't worry about unless there are books that shouldn't be there and need to be split.


Second guess yourself to ensure you don't combine books that Goodreads doesn't want you to combine; for example, avoid combining books that are (2 or more)-in-1/boxed sets containing the same book, and don't pair books with cliff notes versions of books, reference sources for the book, adaptations of the book, and so on. Combining these may result in your losing your Librarian status.

,
Recognize that on top of the fields you were given as a new contributor to Goodreads when creating a book listing, as a Goodreads Librarian you have the ability to add details to a few additional details lines, but doing so is still completely optional, and should only be answered if you have adequate knowledge of every aspect of the book.,
Leave a comment to the book, if there is something special about the book that might make further Librarians skeptical to make other changes to the book.,
Give your other Goodreads Librarian a note of what you did and why in the ""change comments"" field to show that you were acting in good faith and carrying out your role in a responsible manner.,
Click the ""Save Changes"".",How to Edit Book Details as a Goodreads Librarian,";
, With only a few differences, only Goodreads Librarian's are able to make edits to books that they themselves didn't create. Other users can only edit book listings they themselves created, but not others.

, By learning this, you'll know what to expect when it comes to adjusting the information in a Goodreads book record as a Goodreads Librarian as the edit page is a modified edition of the Manually Enter Books page on Goodreads. Also, Goodreads Librarians should know and understand when to create alternate cover editions (Goodreads sometimes refers to this as their ACEs) when they don't exist yet, and knowing the proper format is crucial in this pages' knowledge.

Although that's one of the jobs a Goodreads Librarian should know how to perform extraordinarily well, knowing what is a new book and what is just a new edition of an already established book is vital to understanding your Librarian role on Goodreads and to understanding what issues you'll come to need to tackle.







, If you find same titles and authors when you search for a book, there's a good possibility that you'll need to combine or split these books instead, but not all books will have editions to edit or combine.


It isn't mentioned too often and is often overlooked, but there are ways to remove absolute duplicate editions with what Goodreads calls a ""merge"". However, it's much trickier to tackle and should be done in only certain circumstances..

, Some books will need edits made that can only be made under Super Librarians, which is sort-of like a supervisor of all Librarians who has even more privileges than that of a regular Librarian. However, the majority of books are editable by regular Librarians. If you still need help editing a book, you can still post in the Goodreads Librarians Group asking for a Super Librarian explaining the situation., Look for the book you'll need to edit the details too.

, Although this link could either be under the ""publishing date and publisher"" or if you have the details expanded, under the ""Other Editions"" and the three links below that, or just a little to the left of the right siderail labeled ""Genres"".


Most Goodreads Librarians who work on the Goodreads database, will want to have the book profile details expanded. However, doing this will be left up to you and how you will read to understand if a book needs edits made.

,, These fields include the ""literary awards"", ""characters"", ""series"" and plot settings of the book which Goodreads calls their ""book settings"". These additional fields are found underneath the four existent lines in Work Settings that all users have, just below ""media type"", which need to be spelled out as is shown on the book itself, characters, series and book settings.


For literary awards, these award names must be spelled out as is shown on or in the book itself, and must be rather notable awards. To list these, you'd write the award name followed by a space followed by the year in parenthesis. For those where the book was a nominee, you'd type the word ""Nominee"" to the right of the award title before the opening parenthesis.For ""characters"" field, only list the most crucial characters that you come across and only one character per line entry. However, if the characters name could pose to become a spoiler, type an alias to the character (with the preceding *spoiler* designation) in the box and type their real characters name in the Alias field. However, if you had to combine editions, any characters written to those other editions will combine into this record too, so double check for duplicate character entries before adding others.. If you are currently reading the book and have gotten through knowing the characters well enough, enter each of these characters in the form by clicking on the ""add characters"" link, type the name into the ""Add a character"" textbox and click ""Add"". If there are characters in this box, verify that all the names are correct and push forward. You can correct the names of these characters or merge with other characters by clicking the ""Merge with Another"" button and complete the tasks to merge the characters together.
For ""series"" and ""settings"", follow the series rules and this list should populate by itself. And as for settings, you can add popular settings of the book, but realize that if you are working in a series, this list will autopopulate with other settings from other volumes of the book.Add or adjust the plot-setting(or settings) of the book to ensure all readers understand where this book is set. Fill out the remainder of the form after you click the ""add new setting"" or ""edit setting"". These boxes include text-entries for the place name (to designate what place the information is from) and year, as well as the drop-down for the country.

, Look below the line for ""Save Changes"", ""Cancel changes"" and the ""Delete This Book"" link for the ""Add a comment"" link for librarian comments and leave a comment. Perhaps it might be that other reputable sites list the book as having x pages when the book is in front of you has different and you've verified the ISBN/ASIN to match - but this is just one good reason to explain and each reason to leave a comment here is different. This is a completely-optional link that doesn't need to be added to unless it is worthy of noting for further Librarians to understand. However, if you see something in this area when you make an edit, check to make sure the change hasn't been noted for changing and make the change itself.If the comment you leave here is too pressing and needs to be acted upon faster than just a few days to a few months time (or until another Librarian opens up this page), you may want to leave a note on the Google Groups link for action instead., Although short summaries for some edits are possible (such as ""adding additional details"" when the previous version was lacking these details), others may take more words to properly explain (especially when there was data but was inaccurate for some reason. You may end up explaining that you had to research/verify the data at an approved site and included the corrected details.Remember, you can always verify books with Amazon and WorldCat, but never with Amazon's competitors.


You'll need to explain what you did in your edit in this field as all Goodreads Librarians will see this history and ensure that the details were carried out correctly.

, Recognize that while ""Save Changes"" will publish the edit, there are only certain times when books can be deleted from the database (which is part of the merge process, but has certain rules to follow prior to deleting the book. However, if you are unsure that you are making the correct decision to edit a book, you can always back out or click the ""Cancel changes"" button to reverse your own decisions without publishing any portion of your edit (which can sometimes come in handy).

,, If there is no listing for your ISBN/ASIN, you'll need to search by title to see if what Goodreads already has is just a different edition entirely. If it does exist, great; you're through with your search and ready.

,


Click the ""More details"" link found just below the book's publication date, format and page numbering section.
Click the ""All editions"" link that exists underneath the covers of the book in the ""Other editions"" area of the page.
Narrow the list of editions down a bit to your exact format type. If it is a Kindle edition, select ""Kindle Edition"" from the drop-down. If it is paperback or hardcover, select either of these from the drop-down instead.
Look for your exact book's cover in the list with the correct format type opened.
You might need to open it (by clicking on the book's cover icon or title link) to make sure it's the alternate cover edition.
If you don't find your version of the book cover there, it's time to create it.

,, It should be above the ""...less detail"" and ""edit details links"" but below the ""Other Editions"" cover icon links or other details link after expanding your selecting after next to the ""expand details"" link and ""sort by"" drop-down.


If you are a Goodreads Librarian, you'll find this link under the links for ""combine editions"" and ""separate editions"" links near the right hand corner of the screen where the other editions of the books lie without opening any of these cover editions.

, If you have made sure to double-check for duplicates there you are good to go - just don't re-enter the ISBN or ASIN in the box. At this stage, get just the title, author and description fields filled in.


The sort-by title is mandatory and is easy to fill in. Just type the title in again, as if you were looking through an old-style card catalog. You can omit the words A, an, the, etc and type the remainder of the textA title known as ""A New Light"" would be listed as just ""New Light"".
Book entries that are part of a series get some special treatment. As opposed to adding the volume number last, you add it after the last few words at the end of the title. (i.e.""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets would be sorted out as ""chamber of secrets (Harry Potter, #2), harry potter) as opposed to ""chamber of secrets, harry potter (Harry Potter, #2)"". However, be aware that new editions of already present books should have the corrected sort-by field entered already when you enter in to add another edition entry.

, Make sure the format you have to list matches what is selected in this list. You'll have many choices, and you can even list other formats if needed.

, Begin it by saying ""This book is the alternate cover edition of by with the as its duplicate ASIN number."" An example statement that you must add to the top of the description box might be:

<i>This is the alternate cover edition of XYZ title by ABC author with the unique ASIN/ISBN number (specify number here).</i>


This would look, to the reader, a little like:


This is the alternate cover edition of XYZ title by ABC author with the unique ASIN/ISBN number (specify number here).

Think of what site you're wanting to use/chat at.,
Go to your browser (Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.),
Read the options the search engine.",How to Find and Use Social Networking Websites1," Make a list of criteria; maybe wanting to chat about random things, a specific thing, you can even use the internet to find dates!;
, and search what kind of site you're looking for.


If you're under 18, specifically put what age you are in a search. You never know who you're talking to, there could be an internet predator who's wanting to harm you.

, Usually they'll give a small description of what the site is about before you click. Read it, and decide if you like it or not. If you like it from the description, click it and check it out.


Be cautious and use a virus checker before you go onto a website.
Places like Yahoo, Twitter and Facebook are pretty safe, still be cautious and watchful about people you may not know.

"
"
Look over the site to know if it's what you were thinking of.,
Make an account.,
Fill out your profile.,
Be active in their community.",How to Find and Use Social Networking Websites2," Sometimes you can join a site but not really like it, try to avoid this, especially if you've put any personal info on. A stalker could get that and use it against you, without you knowing it.


If it's possible, search and see what people say about the website you're thinking of joining. If they give them good rates, or if people say it's dangerous, it'll vary, but always look at the comments and see any warnings.

, If you like the website, make an account. They'll usually ask for the following:


Username
Password
E-mail address
Gender
First name
Last name
Zip/postal code
State
City

, This is fun, just fill out the basic info you want (Or feel comfortable to give) and save it.

, Explore the site and see how things work, if it's a chat room, hang out in it and see what people talk about.


If you ever feel uncomfortable in a chat (If someone asks you info you don't wan to give away), you don't have to answer. Just say ""I value my privacy"" and if they keep pushing, leave the chat.

Know the power of social media.,
Leverage the growing power of social media.,
Understand how ""social"" is different for someone born in 1990 than for someone born in 1950, and yet it is the same.",How to Enhance Interpersonal Communications Through Social Networks," A Nielsen Wire study notes statistics that illustrate the rise of social media use in recent years. We inherently know that social media use rises each year (from the turn of the 21st century, forward). Every media imaginable reports our use of social media and social networking practices. A Nielsen Wire study report included actual statistics and graphs on the “social media phenomenon” for us visual information processors. , We can no longer consider the social media phenomenon a ""new thing"". Google, Twitter, Facebook, Myspace, and other sites have been around long enough for an entire generation of people to know nothing except these tools as communications media. That generation is a growing part of the workplace. That generation is making decisions about how the workplace operates and how we communicate within the workplace. The generation—born in 1985 and beyond will be in decision-making positions before we know it, if not already in their own businesses. When they are decision-makers rather than “just influencers”, the pace of change in the workplace will really take off.


Workplace changes include considering and implementing better use of social networking rather than just asking, ""Should we use these tools?"" One of the primary advantages of social network tools is the expanded ""social"" aspect.

, Too many articles and blogs note the negatives of social media and social networks. Let's look at the positives of ""social"" in social networks:


Increased ""social"". We connect with people more readily and more easily through social networking tools. For those with self-esteem challenges and those who consider themselves ""social wallflowers"" or ""introverts"", connecting with people on social networks helps them break out of their shells through a keyboard or keypad. There are more connections rather than fewer. We establish more communities over a broader world span. These communities offer more support, greater assistance in times of need, and more-immediate news and information on which we can act (or not!) as a more-informed decision-making society.
More ""self"" revealed. Some will say this is a negative development when considering sexting and personal data online. On the positive side, though, we tend to reveal more of our honest feelings to each other online than we do in person. When we release the ""stuff"" inside us that keeps us tense and uptight, we experience better overall health. We establish tighter relationships that create a stronger social support structure. Realize, however, that a delicate balance must exist between too much information (or too personal for public eyes online), honesty, personal safety, and organizational security. A lot of dishonesty exists in the world. When we make self-revelations, we must do so smartly.
Greater language skills required. Person-to-person communications involve multiple components of messaging: the words we use, our vocal variety, our body language, movements, and positioning, our facial expressions, listening skills, and more. With social media we have the words we use, emoticons, and only with a webcam do we have visual cues, or a microphone, the audio cues (as of this writing, anyway). The other components of effective interpersonal communications are missing – including immediate feedback and response in many cases. Therefore, our skill with how we choose and use our words must improve in order to make up for the other cues we miss. We must have better command of our language skills.
""Interpersonal"" includes being more social, revealing more of ourselves honestly and safely, and using language more effectively. Social networks, when used and managed effectively, allow us to practice our interpersonal communication skills in a laser-focused way. Our challenge is not to hide behind social networks, but to use them to initiate more in-person interaction, positively and safely.

Review your past posts.,
Track your time online.,
Acknowledge your addiction.,
Reflect on your need for social media.,
Seek outside help.",How to Defeat a Social Networking Addiction1," As you begin working on combating your social networking addiction, you should first work to understand your social media usage. Take some time to review your posts from the past week or month. Write down how many things you posted in order to assess their frequency. Consider whether all the things you posted were necessary.

For instance, if you posted about a meal you had or about going to get a haircut, consider whether or not posting those things brought you or anyone else any joy or contentment.;
, If you are unsure of the extent of your addiction, you can determine how much time you spend by tracking your usage. Make a tick mark in a notebook each time you check a site. A more advanced and accurate way to determine usage, however, is to download an app designed to do so. Apps like QualityTime keep a count of how much time you spend on each social media site.Decide how much social media time seems reasonable; if you are exceeding that, it’s time to cut back.

, Consider the times when others have constantly made comments to you about always being on social media. Think also of the times that you find yourself unable to keep up with your responsibilities. If you notice a pattern, then it is time to admit that you have a problem. Make a pact to commit to improving your situation. Remember that overcoming your denial and acknowledging your problem are the first steps.

Take a break from your social media for one hour and assess how you feel. If you feel jittery or nervous, you might have an addiction.

, Sometimes a social media addiction might arise out of having little to do or out of a need for attention or connection with others. Take some time to write down your thoughts about this to explore the root of the problem.After assessing the roots, develop a plan to address it. If your issues stem from boredom, then find fun things to do offline.

, For some, the desire to use social media constantly might feel beyond their own control. If you feel that you are unable to escape from the addiction, seek help from a therapist trained in that area. There are also support groups available for people struggling with the same or similar issues. It can be helpful to feel that you are not alone in your addiction and to discuss potential solutions for the problem.Remember that there is no stigma in seeking help.

"
"
Deactivate your accounts.,
Remove cellphone apps.,
Change your password.",How to Defeat a Social Networking Addiction2," After you have sufficiently assessed the issue, take a break from social media to clear your mind and begin breaking your bad habit. Deactivate your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and any other social media that you might have. This is a good way to give yourself space from your addiction without having to necessarily delete your accounts.During this time, develop a timeline for when and if you will get your social media back. Find healthy activities to replace your social media addiction.

, In addition to deactivating the accounts, in order to further deter your temptation, delete the apps from your phone. Not being able to see the apps on your homescreen may help you during this time of self reflection and habit-breaking., If you feel that you cannot successfully beat the habit on your own, then hand over the account to someone you trust. Have them change the password so that you cannot access the account even if you want to. Tell them to give you the account after the predetermined period ends.Make sure to only give your password to family or friends that you deeply trust. Giving your password away is highly sensitive and could end disastrously if in the wrong hands.
Consider ceasing social media usage for a minimum of three weeks, as it typically takes 21 days to form a habit.

"
"
Stick to a time limit.,
Change the notification settings on your phone.,
Delete extra people from your friend list.,
Prioritize.,
Limit your memberships.,
Avoid posting about your every move.",How to Defeat a Social Networking Addiction3," Only use the social networking site when you know that all your day's work is done or when you have a break. Avoid taking breaks from your work to use social media, as you will likely become unproductive. You may find that two hours have flown by and you are still online while your work is being neglected. Only login once you are completely free of all your responsibilities. Set a time limit on how much you use your social media after your day is done.


Set a timer on your phone.

, You might have developed an addiction for social media because you are constantly getting notifications on your phone from your friends commenting or posting on your wall. In order to combat this, you can edit the notification settings in your phone or within the app so that you don’t get notifications, but can instead check the app at your leisure when you’re not busy.For instance, you might make it where you don’t get notifications for “likes” but you do for comments. You have many options to help you stay clear of social media.

, The more people you follow or are friends with on social media, the larger your news feed will be, and the more time you spend checking things out while you could be engaging in a more useful activity. Spend some time purging your friends list to only include your friends in real life or people who you know well.

, If you have an important assignment coming up, then temporarily deactivate your account. Another option is to install COLD TURKEY, which is a program that physically blocks you from various addicting sites. Remember that while social media can enhance your life, you should still attend properly to your relationships and responsibilities.Assess whether any of your close friends, partner, or family have complained about your lack of attention due to constantly being on a device.

, You might have three social media accounts or you might have ten. In order to limit the time you spend in total checking these sites, you could choose to delete a few of them and only keep the ones you value most. For instance, if you don’t particularly like Instagram but do like Facebook, consider deleting your Instagram., Enjoy the moments that you’re making while you’re making them and don’t feel the need to photograph or post about every moment in your life. Be present in the moment and enjoy the people and circumstances that surround you."
"
Write a list of things you could be spending your time on.,
Get out of the house.,
Call instead of checking in on social media.,
Spend more time with family.,
Develop yourself professionally.",How to Defeat a Social Networking Addiction4," Keep in mind that every minute that you spend on social media takes a minute from some other more productive activity that you could put your time towards. Some of these things could include learning a new language, playing an instrument, hanging out with friends, exercising, learning a new recipe, or reading a book.

Consider your relationships that have gone lacking because of your social media addiction. Your significant other or children may be feeling neglected because of it.
Your social media addition could be hampering your life and relationships and keeping you from your goals.

, Perhaps the most constructive and certainly the most fun way to battle your social media addiction is to get out of the house and have some fun. Call up your friends and go out to a movie or have dinner. Go bowling, swimming, running, or shopping. These are healthy and fun ways to combat your addiction while relaxing., You might find that your social media addiction developed because you used a site to communicate with someone as opposed to calling them. You might have gotten caught up on the site awaiting their response and developed an addiction from that. However, try to have conversations with friends and family via phone rather than social media apps., In order to prevent yourself from relapsing or not keeping your commitment to cease social media usage temporarily, spend more time with your family and friends. Go visit your grandparents and do errands for them, and hang out with your mom more. Hang out with siblings and friends more during this time as well and resist using your phone, even if they are., Once you have more free time from social media, you will be better able to invest in other things. Perhaps you have been considering a career change or thinking about going back to school. Take this time to research schools and jobs. A change might be just what you need to create a healthier, happier and more electronically detached life."

Pledge to upload your photos after you return.,
Schedule posts in advance, if you use social media for work.,
Commit to limiting emails and other operations, too.",How to Ditch Social Media While on Vacation1," If you tell yourself beforehand that you won’t be uploading photos during your vacation, you’re more likely to stick to your pledge. You might even tease your friends and followers about the onslaught of media you’ll have for them when you get back. , If your job requires logging onto social media several times a day, it may be hard to step away during vacation. But, you can. Most social media outlets let you schedule posts in advance. If not, there is extension software that will allow you to schedule posts on various media outlets at once.Scheduling in advance can help you stay “active” on social media for your job while still taking an actual break. If someone is needed to respond to comments or post news updates, ask a coworker to step in for you.

, No doubt, you have been conditioned to move to your favorite social media outlets after you do other operations on your smartphone. Paying a bill or responding to an email may inadvertently lead to you losing hours of your vacation time lurking on your friends’ pages. To avoid this, limit your smartphone use to its most basic functions—making calls, sending texts, and checking the weather.


Ensure that you stay off social media by logging out completely. This also helps so that you aren’t drawn in by nonstop notifications.
The point of a vacation is to take a break from work. Making this commitment might help you overcome your workaholic problem, if you have one."

Challenge yourself to be present in every moment.,

Sign up for a yoga class.,
Sigh with relief about how relaxed you feel.",How to Ditch Social Media While on Vacation2," Practice mindfulness on your vacation and you’ll have a much better chance of ditching social media. No matter where you are, there is an abundance of sensation and experience if you open your mind to it. Use your vacation to reconnect with the world around you.Really watch the sun as it sets. Take the time to read the little plaques at the museum or art gallery. Become fully absorbed in the music. Appreciate the smell, taste, and texture of the foods you eat.

, It should go without saying that if you came on vacation with someone, they should demand most of your attention, not your social media feed. Whether you’re with friends, a partner, or your family, be sure to attend to your present company.


Social media can wait, but a vacation offers a unique opportunity to connect with those you love away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.
Unplugging helps improve conversations, boost eye contact, and even makes you appear more approachable to others., Yoga is a great activity that naturally promotes mindfulness. Plus, it is such a universally practiced exercise that you’ll be able to locate a class virtually wherever you are. Most resorts, spas, and retreats offer yoga classes. Plus, if you’re in a city, you can catch a class in a local studio., You might initially miss checking in on your friends and followers. Hopefully sooner than later, however, you’ll truly notice how much you have been missing out on by being absorbed in your phone. A social media detox can help relieve tension and make you remember the things in life that are truly important—like running into the oceans waves with your bestie."

State your intentions publicly.,
Download a detox app.,

Don’t take your smart phone to every activity.",How to Ditch Social Media While on Vacation3," Studies show that social accountability has a major impact on you sticking with a commitment. Let everyone know that you are planning to stay off social media for the duration of your trip. If you happen to slip, they’ll help get you back on the right track.You might simply tell your companions “I won’t be logging onto social media while we’re away.” Or, you might tell the world by updating your status, “Sorry, guys, but I’m headed on vacation. Won’t be posting until I return.”

, Technology is quite helpful when it comes to staying accountable. Lucky for you, there are numerous applications you can download that help control your smartphone usage. You can block your access to the internet for a short time with apps like Freedom or Self-Control. Or, you can stop yourself from using social media apps specifically., Another conditioned response many people have is uploading photos immediately after taking them. If this describes you, it may help to depart from your smart phone camera for the trip. Slip your smart phone into your bag, and use a real camera. You may even get better photos., Checking your phone is almost like second nature. Keep yourself accountable and resist the urge to log back in by leaving it behind. If you’re with someone else who has a phone, you’ll still have contact to the outside world."

Notice how often you use Facebook.,
Pay attention to how you interact with others on Facebook.,
Notice if Facebook is getting in the way of other things in your life.",How to Determine if You Should Quit Facebook1," Start by considering how much time you spend on Facebook on a daily basis. Do you change your Facebook status every hour on the hour? Do you end up scrolling through your newsfeed for way too long? Do you tend to check your Facebook a little too often? These may be signs that you are spending too much time on Facebook.You can also think about your Facebook use on a weekly basis. For example, maybe you spend an average of two hours a day on Facebook. That means you end up spending 14 hours a week on Facebook, which may seem like too much, especially if you have a busy, demanding schedule.;
, You should also consider how you communicate with others on Facebook. Do you have long, meaningful chats with friends on your Facebook wall? Or do you give out random “likes” on posts by friends you have not spoken to in years? If you are starting to feel like your connections with others on your Facebook are superficial or unfulfilling, it may be time to consider taking a break.For example, you may track your interactions on Facebook for one week. Notice if you spend your time chatting with friends and having in depth, quality conversations with them. You should also notice if you spend most of your time scrolling through your newsfeed, wasting time reading about people you barely know.
If you start to notice that you use Facebook less to connect with others and more to simply pass the time, you may consider quitting the site. It may not be a useful thing that adds anything to your life.

, Consider if Facebook is taking up time you could be spending on other pursuits, such as your school work, your hobbies, or your career. You may realize that you are spending time on Facebook that could be going to other passions or goals. Cutting out Facebook could free you up to spend more time and energy on projects you want to do or goals you would like to achieve.For example, you may notice that the time you are spending on Facebook is getting in the way of you completing a personal writing project. Or perhaps all the time you are spending on Facebook is causing you to neglect your school work or your homework.

"
"
Talk to your friends about quitting Facebook.,
Discuss the issue with your family.,
Reach out to others who have already quit Facebook.",How to Determine if You Should Quit Facebook2," If you are still unsure if you should quit Facebook, you may try talking to your friends about the decision. Ask your friends if they think it is a good idea to quit Facebook. Discuss the reasons why you are considering getting off of Facebook as well as the pros and cons of doing so.For example, you may say to your friends, “I’m thinking about quitting Facebook. What do you think? Should I do it?” or “Why do you all use Facebook? Do you feel like it is worth using?”

, You can also try talking to your family about the decision, especially if you have younger family members who are avid Facebook users. Discuss the reasons why they use Facebook and compare your own experiences in social media. Your family members may be able to offer insight as to whether you are addicted to Facebook and would do well to get off of it.


For example, you may say to your family, “I might delete my Facebook account because I feel like I am wasting valuable time on there. What do you think?”

, To get some perspective on your decision, you can also try reaching out to people you know who have successfully quit Facebook, such as friends or family members. You may get in touch with them and ask them how and why they made their decision. You may also share your own thoughts on the subject and get some advice from them about whether or not you should delete your account.


For example, you may say to the person, “Why did you quit Facebook? Has it benefited you in any way? Do you regret doing it?”

Challenge yourself to no Facebook for a certain number of days.,
Communicate with others in different ways.,
Focus on other hobbies or interests.",How to Determine if You Should Quit Facebook3," If you make up your mind to quit Facebook, you may need to then figure out how you are going to stick to your decision and avoid getting sucked back into using the site. Try challenging yourself to not going on Facebook for a set number of days, such as 50 days straight with no Facebook or 100 days with no Facebook. Putting a set number on your time away can help you stay motivated and stick to your choice.You may write a daily reminder on your calendar or in your phone so you can keep track of how many days you have been off Facebook. Give yourself a pat on the back for every day you stay off of Facebook to stay motivated.

, Delete your Facebook account on your computer and on your smartphone. Then, work on communicating with others through email, text, phone calls, or meet ups in real life. Make an effort to connect to others outside of Facebook so you do not lose touch with your loved ones. Having other ways of communicating will also ensure you are not tempted to go back on Facebook.For example, you may set up a weekly coffee date with a friend so you can catch up outside of Facebook, in real life. Or you may start an email chain with family so you can still keep in touch online, but off Facebook.

, Now that you are no longer on Facebook, you have a lot of time freed up to focus on your hobbies or interests. Take up a hobby that you were always too busy to try. Or delve more into an interest you have never had time for because you were always glued to Facebook. Fill your time with things that will be fulfilling and meaningful to you, especially now that you have more time on your hands.For example, you may take up a hobby like writing, reading, painting, or drawing. Or you may try recreational sports or join a social justice club to fill your time in more meaningful ways.

Know the reason why you need to contact someone.,
Understand the ways through which you can communicate.,
Consider the length of the post.,
Consider how urgent the post is.,
Consider what this person would normally do when they want to contact you.",How to Decide How to Contact Someone on Facebook," Since Facebook is a Social Networking site, you may contact someone for a variety of reasons. You may send them a 'Happy Birthday' message or a message which may not be suitable for all. Being sensible will help you to decide how you may contact a person on Facebook.;
, Facebook is a vast site giving flexibility to its users to communicate in a variety of ways depending on the amount of privacy that message requires.


When you post on someone's timeline, the message is absolutely public and anyone who is a friend of that user will be able to see it. The commonly sent messages through this method are birthday wishes, get-together photos, optimistic quotes, etc.

Using the chat feature in Facebook, the message you send is only visible to the user in his/her chat box. So, if you want to share something personal, you may go for this method.
If your account is logged in at multiple platforms, it might become difficult to keep all your devices from sneaky eyes, so the best and most private way to ask for the user's email or phone number through Facebook. This is the best way to prevent your conversation from being seen by others.

, A long letter with numerous paragraphs should be reserved for emails, while something a little bit shorter could be put into a message, and small sentences or other brief messages such as event invitation or a picture post can be put on their wall or on their chat box.

, Depending on the person, they may check their Facebook or their email more often than the other. Maybe the only way to reach them while they're at work is via email. Consider this if you have pressing news to deliver. Some people never even check their Facebook, or, alternately, their email. If it is news that absolutely cannot wait, then the best way to reach them would typically be by calling them.

, Some people are accustomed to using email as if it were chat, and some leave long, serious messages on each other's walls. Think back to the last interaction you had with this specific person online. What do they normally use each method for? Asking such question can lead you to a right decision.

Create a separate group for family.,
Don't post raunchy things to Facebook.,
Consider keeping two separate Facebook accounts.,
Unfollow a family member.,
Speak to your family member about the problem.",How to Deal With Your Family on Facebook1," Do this by opening your chat box, going to ""Friend Lists,"" and creating a family group. For simplicity's sake, call it ""Family"". You can drag and drop people into this list. This way, you can talk with your family in a private message thread, and you find it easier to keep your family separate from your friends.


This can be a great way to bring family together. If you have a family-specific group, you might be more inclined to post about family matters there. You can cut through the social saturation of Facebook and share focused, curated information with your relatives.
When family members request to be your friends on Facebook, make sure that you put them in the ""Family"" group. This way, you'll be able to keep them separate from everyone else. If you don't do this right away, you might forget!;
, Understand that ultimately, the easiest way to deal with your family on Facebook is to keep your social interactions off of the site. Text your friends, or use an instant messaging app, or just hang out in person, if possible. If you are posting things that you absolutely don't want your family to see, consider who else can see them: friends, peers, and maybe (someday) potential employers. Facebook owns these posts, and they will be stored on the site for years to come – so ask yourself which sort of personal information you want to make public on the Internet.

, You can have a ""family-friendly"" account for tame posts that you don't mind your relatives picking through, and then create a ""real"" account where you post all of the things that you don't want your family to see. If you are very committed to your online life, this can be a solid way to keep everything separate.


Be aware of the privacy settings on the second, ""real"" account. If even one family member comes across the new account, he or she may send it a friend request – and your ""cover"" will be blown. Consider using the privacy settings to make your new account unsearchable.
If you are unable to have two accounts or don't want two accounts, then you will not be able to post everything you want publicly if you don't want your family to see it. You will have to post to specific groups or to ""friends only, except for <insert names here>"", until you are ready to share something with your family. Make sure to pay close attention to the sharing options before you post.

, If you have a friend or family member who posts things that you don't like or don't want to see, you can ""unfollow"" them so that their posts no longer show up on your Newsfeed. This way, you don't need to unfriend or block a family member, but you also don't need to deal with them as much. Once you ""unfollow"", you will no longer see anything that they post in your Newsfeed. You can go to their page if you want to see their activity.


Bear in mind that the unfollowed family member will still be able to see whatever you post, and they can still ""like"" and comment on your posts.

, If a family member is making you uncomfortable with the things that they're posting on your profile, the most straightforward solution is to confront him/her. This may or may not be appropriate, depending on the situation – but it will at least put your frustrations out in the open.If the relative is just oblivious about Facebook etiquette, try to kindly educate him/her about what to do.
If you're just embarrassed that your family posts on your Facebook, period, then there's not much you can do beyond blocking them from your posts with the privacy settings.

Customize your privacy settings.,
Block family members from seeing your posts.,
Block family members from specific posts, as you post them.,
Review your Activity Log to block family from specific posts.,
Ask one of your existing friends to test the privacy for you.",How to Deal With Your Family on Facebook2," First, navigate to your privacy settings. Reach the Settings menu from the drop-down menu in the top right-hand corner of the screen, just above the ""Log Out"" action. Once you're on the Settings page, click ""Privacy"" on the menu that runs down the left side of the screen; this will take you to the Privacy Settings and Tools page.You should see three categories, each of which includes several filters:



Who can see my stuff? This section allows you to customize who sees your posts, photos, and tags. You can block individual family members from seeing specific types of posts. For instance, you can make it so that your parents can't see the photos you're tagged in.Who can contact me? This is a way to regulate you can send you friend requests and private messages. Your family members may notice if you outright block them from your profile, so this may not be the best option for such a delicate situation.

Who can look me up? This is the highest level of security: you can control who is able to find your profile using your email address and phone number, and you can unlist your Timeline from regular search engine traffic. This option probably isn't terribly useful if your family is already on Facebook.

, Click ""Edit"" next to ""Who can see your future posts?"" Select the drop-down menu that reads either ""Friends"" or ""Public"", and click ""More Options"" to open a further menu. Click ""Custom"" to choose to share or not share your posts with specific people or groups. Type your family members' names under ""Don't share with"" to block them from seeing your posts.


If you've made a separate family group, you can type in the group name in place of individual family member names. This way, you can add new family members to the group as they add you on Facebook.

, Use the privacy slider in the status box right when you make a new post. The drop-down menu is exactly the same as the one you found on the Custom Privacy screen. This way, you can choose to share or not share each new post with specific groups of people. You might block a very confrontational cousin from seeing a political status update, or you might prevent your parents from seeing photos of last weekend's big party.

, Back in the ""Who can see my stuff?"" box, click ""Use Activity Log"". You'll see a list of everything you've ever done on Facebook: likes, comments, tagged photos, etc. Scroll through the log looking for things that you don't want your family to see. Click the drop-down menu from the globe icon, click Custom, and type your family members' names in the box beneath ""Don't share this with"". They won't be able to see this post.


If the post is older than a few hours, consider that your family member may have already seen it. Be aware of your family's Facebook habits, and try to decide what you need to do for damage control.
Be aware of anyone who might tell your family. Consider blocking anyone who you don't trust to keep your activities to themselves. For instance, if your friend's parents are close with your own parents, you might consider blocking the friend's parents on Facebook to reduce the risk of them passing anything along.

, Add them to the ""Family"" group and then ask them to poke through your profile. To them, it should appear to be a very boring profile, because they can't see any pictures, status updates, etc. That's what your family will see."

Who can add things to my timeline? Use this category to control who can post on your timeline. You can block all friends from posting to your timeline, but you can't block specific groups (say, Family). You can also set up a review system whereby you review things that your friends tag you in before they wind up on your timeline.

Who can see things on my timeline? Use this to review what other people see on your timeline; you can specially regulate who can see the posts that you're tagged in, and you can control who sees what others post on your timeline. Once you've tweaked the settings, click ""View As"" to see your timeline as someone else sees it: say, your friend, or your grandmother.

How can I manage tags people add and tagging suggestions? You can choose to review the tags that people add to your own posts (say, in comments) before those tags appear on Facebook public.

, Under ""Who can add things to my timeline?"", click ""Edit"" next to ""Who can post on your timeline?"" Select ""Only Me"" from the drop-down menu, instead of ""Friends"". This way, no one will post anything—good or bad—to your wall.


Alternately, select ""Review posts friends tag you in before they appear on your timeline?"" Then, choose ""Enable"" from the drop-down menu. This way, you'll be able to carefully curate what shows up on your timeline.

, Click ""Edit"" next to ""Who can see posts that you've been tagged in on your timeline?"" Then, select ""Custom"" from the drop-down menu. Type your family members' names in the box beneath ""Don't share with"" to block them from seeing posts on your wall. Next, do the same with ""Who can see what others post on your timeline?""

, In the ""How can I manage tags people add and tagging suggestions?"" box, select ""Edit"" next to ""Review tags that people add to your own posts before the tags appear on Facebook"". Then, select ""Enabled"" from the drop-down menu. Now, you should be able to stop friends from making offensive tags on your Facebook posts.

Show Goodreads that you can be trusted with the rights of a librarian; you can say it outright or demonstrate it with the rest of your answers. If you've taken on admin/moderation roles on other sites or in other communities, you might want to mention that, too.
Address why you want to do it . Explain that you see inaccuracies in the site and would like to help out with correcting these inaccuracies. For example, you can start out explaining that you'd like to help correct page numbering issues.
Give them reason to believe that you take the role seriously and are willing and able to get it right. For example, you might highlight tasks you've done like adding cover pictures from on your own scans (ISBN to ISBN versions) or (for Amazon Kindle/book information. You can use the phrase ""I will do the best I can to provide the most accurate data possible"" to reinforce the point that you will take the responsibilities seriously.
Demonstrate that you understand their policies. For example, explain that you can merge and unmerge items responsibly. If you've commented in the Librarians group, you can highlight that participation; this is a great place for them to understand that you have learned what can be and can not be merged or unmerged.
Give them an idea of the status of your shelves. Demonstrate that you understand the workings of the Goodreads site, including how books can be reviewed, shelved to other shelves, and updated.

, If you can attest to that, check the box. If not, you might want to hold back and wait until you can.

, Although most often this can be determined by comparing the title with titles by the same author already on the Goodreads site, since every book is different, there are exceptions.


Newspapers, magazines, and comics are not books. By definition, these are not books for Goodreads, and therefore MUST not be added to the database.

",How to Add a New Book to the Goodreads Database2,";
, You'll need a few things directly from your book. If you don't have a copy of that particular book handy, it's good to note that Goodreads allows information to be copied off of the WorldCat and Amazon given you have a copy of the ISBN or ASIN of that copy of the book handy. As per policy, you can't take any information from Amazon's competitor, Barnes and Noble, and therefore this information can't be borrowed (such as for a Nook version of your book)., Although the page tool does a secondary search for verification to see if the book exists and gives you comparable results, take a moment to second check this list. title and determine if any comparable matches can be found. If you think the book's title is a match, but aren't completely sure, right-click the item and click either ""open in New Window"" or ""Open in New Tab"".


If the book is part of a volume or set of books, this titling can be interesting. After the title of the book, enter a space then the volume number in parenthesis. (i.e. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets should be titled as ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Harry Potter, #2)"" (However, this item is already in the database so don't use this example as a real entry of a brand new book).

, Type the title in again, as if you were looking through an old-style card catalog. You can omit the words A, an, the, etc and type the remainder of the textA title known as ""A New Light"" would be listed as just ""New Light"".


Book entries that are part of a series get some special treatment. As opposed to adding the volume number last, you add it after the last few words at the end of the title. (i.e.""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets would be sorted out as ""chamber of secrets (Harry Potter, #2), harry potter) as opposed to ""chamber of secrets, harry potter (Harry Potter, #2)"". However, be aware that new editions of already present books should have the corrected sort-by field entered already when you enter in to add another edition entry.

, As is stated on the New book entry page, add authors as they appear on the front of the book; however, if different verification sources disagree on the order or if there is no verifiable cover present, you can list them in alphabetical order.. However, with different format's of authors names, the formatting of the name is different dependent on your exact scenario and few situations will ever be the same for brand new books that aren't in the database just yet.


The very first author should be only the primary author of the book. No other authors should be listed within the first text box of authors. Make sure to return the name with the proper capitalization (capitalization should never be the same as the way it looks on the book, if the book presents it's authors in all-CAPS, but should be written as if it was the legal name entry on a paper form). Make sure to list the names starting with the first name with a space then the middle name (if available) then a space and onto the last name. Doing so will help the Goodreads Librarian link the books (if they indeed find it is a separate edition of an already present edition of an existing book) instead.
Authors who use their initials should list their names without a space between letters of a name but should have a period after each and every initial. (ex. J. L. Roth should be listed in this box as ""J.L. Roth"".)
If the author supplies their middle name as an initial, follow the initial rules in the sub-step immediately above. (If they send their initial, provide their initial followed by a period followed by a space and then their last name. If they provide their full middle name, type that in the box instead, as was written.)
Names with title or degree designations should be included in the list, but must never list these designations in the author name field itself, unless it is necessary to avoid confusion or is part of a recognizable pen name (such as ""Dr. Seuss"") (however, Dr. Doug B. Hornet should be listed as ""Doug B. Hornet"")
Suffixes to a name should be included separated by a space after the last name.
Additional authors (such as editors, narrators for audiobooks, etc.) should be listed as separate entries on new lines in the form. Supply the type of author for the book with the box that is displayed after clicking the ""Add role"" link next to the author's name box. Although you can choose between many different types of author-roles in the author role drop-down, there is a fill-in box that can be accessed if the author role isn't supplied.
If more than one author exists, there's a link just below this box, that asks you for these additional authors. Supply as many as is given in the order they appear on the front cover of the book, after clicking the ""Add author"" link as many times as you need to enter all of them into the appropriate boxes.

, field. Although it's okay to use your own image of that exact book from a file you have on hand, it is also acceptable to use the Amazon book picture (as long as the picture isn't just Goodreads or Amazon stock photos (stock photos on Goodreads look like a brown-covered book with just the plain text of the title and author of the book, as for Amazon, these generic cover art may vary a little more widely depending on the situation) or as long as the photo isn't a book with the same title but as another edition-again, it's best to research the item on Amazon under it's ASIN or ISBN before searching with the title., From one Librarian to the rest of the reading community here on wikiHow, Goodreads wants regular paperback or hardcover books to be listed under the ISBN or ISBN-13 number and use only the ASIN numbers for Kindle and Audible books.Use ISBN numbers for anything else, but you can still research the book on Amazon for information using the items ASIN number.. Click the ""Click for ASIN"" link to switch this box type to ASIN-mode.

, (While the publisher name can be found inside the book on the publisher data or title page or on Amazon itself according to an ISBN number search in the search bar, it is best to use the publication date of the book according to the date Amazon will give to you as the Publication date line will list) However, be careful that you are punctuating and capitalizing the publisher name as it appears there.If there is no data given and the data can't be retrieved from WorldCat, you can take the copyright year, leaving the remainder of the data unlisted for the other portions of the publication year: however, keep that information as a ""case of last resort""..

, As per Goodreads policies, they consider the amount of pages in the book to include all pages in the book, except for advertisements for other books or preview chapters. You can also grab this information from Amazon for this specific edition unique identifier. Other types of books will get special treatment and will vary greatly..


For books that are digital read-outs (or have been narrated, and may include Audiobook, Audio CD, Audio Cassette, Audible Audio, CD-ROM and MP3 CD listings), take the information you obtain for the ISBN and round the hour amount up to the next hour and list that hour reference as the number of pages. Don't try to estimate the pages of the real book to put into audiobook form. Even if the audiobook is only a minute or two long, round it up to the next hour. (e.g. If the listing says the book lasts 3 minutes, the page count should read 1 since the next total amount of hours past the 3 minutes is 1 hour.)

, Most often, these entries will be ""Hardcover"", ""Paperback"", ""Kindle book"" (as opposed to ""eBook"" when bought from the Kindle for Amazon store or bought as it's own Kindle book or ""Audio CD"" or even ""Audible Audio"", but there are many more format types available in this list.Be careful of books of the types of eBooks out there. If it is bought directly from a company selling eBooks (Amazon, Barnes and Noble), these should not be listed as ""ebook"" when these formats are on the list already. There are others that have similar conventions as to format types, but aren't commonly recognized or commonly used, but must be applied. If the book isn't sold from a first-rate retailer (Amazon, Barnes and Noble), you must select ""eBook"" from the list.If you can't determine the format, you must select ""Unknown Binding"". Be careful not to select ""Unbound"" as these look similar from the get-go but mean two completely different things.
Other commonly mismarked format differences include ""Paperback"" with ""Mass Market Paperback"", ""Library Binding"" with ""Hardcover"", ""CD-ROM or MP3-CD with Audio CD"" and must be watched accordingly.
If this type of format isn't available, click the ""Other"" link and type the format into the text-entry box.

, This field is for special entry information only (holiday edition, 2nd edition, etc.). This should be entered in the field as it is written on or inside the cover.

, This field is optional and should be used if there is an author or publisher site that describes the book you have. It should never list a fan site, library or other site about the book., This Description box is critical should the addition other editions pop-up, as these carry-over without even asking the edition adder from one edition to the next. If there is no data on this page as for this description, you can copy the data off the back cover or dust jacket to the book word-for-word, .


Although this rarely happens, if you still have no data for this box, you can write your own summary for the description, without writing a spoiler inside the box and without using images or links to external sites.
You can grab data in certain circumstances as to describe books from Wikipedia, but the exact link to this site must be written inside the description box to explain where this data originated from.

, Although the default selection at the top of the list is English (as English is the most-commonly used language for book entries on Goodreads), this language will depend on what language the book is written in. (i.e. If the book is a translated book (of an English book) into Portuguese, this entry must be selected as ""Portuguese"" since this is the language of the book., Although optional, sending this information out will help those looking to find a book with alternate information, or which has been republished with drastically different information.


Type in the original title and original publication dates using the same formatting as the title and publication dates field formatting above, if the data differs widely from the very first publication to the present-day one. Most often times, the original publication date will be the earliest copyright date mentioned on the book's title/publication data page just a few page-turns inside the book.Watch out for the ""media type"" field. Although it can be your ""best friend"" when the media is something other than a book, it can also be your worst enemy if you accidentally select ""not a book"". For information on what isn't a book or is something other than those books most commonly used, utilize the information presented here. The not a book option will now display for every account that is created, though it is only supposed to show for Goodreads Librarians.

, Although users who are long-time users are grandfathered in to not having to fill this field out, those who aren't will need to fill out this box. The reCaptcha box, once checked, will verify that you aren't a robot that is sending new books through the database, each and every time you fill out this form.

Search for the profile page of the book, and make this book display.,
Click on the ""Add New Edition"" link that is found underneath the section containing images of other editions of the book that are other editions of the book in the database.,
Verify the pre-filled text of the Add a New Edition page is displayed.,
Try adding in the ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 numbers into the appropriate fields, or switch the ISBN numbers into ASIN entry (for Kindle or Audible books) by clicking the ""Click for ASIN"" and typing the data into the appropriate field according to what is displayed in the book's details.,
Enter all other data into the form, including the cover image of the book, utilizing the same form data as you would have entered had you been entering a new book itself.,
Click on the ""Create book"" button at the bottom of the form of data you've just entered.

",How to Add a New Book to the Goodreads Database3," At the very least, search by the ISBN or ASIN number. Then try searching by complete title, but this type isn't very good. Not only will searching help narrow the search down to books with the same name, it'll also narrow the search down to duplicate editions of existing editions of the same book you might be wanting to add. Click the most accurate match to another version of the book (according to title), if it still doesn't display.


If a relative search result displays in the search bar in real-time (especially with an ASIN/ISBN search), this yields the possibility that you'll need to add another edition if the two items aren't the same. If you searched by the title and came up with a relative title, it's time to create an alternate edition with the title given - if not, it's time to create a new book entirely.

, If there are no other editions of the book, you'll find this link towards the top of the listing above the ""Get a copy"" section that contains some critical other places to purchase the book that is always displayed.

, With the New Edition page, the form will prefill several items including the title, sort-by title, author, and description - most of which you can just do a ""once-over"". The rest you'll have to type in manually.


Recognize the need to add what Goodreads calls an ""alternate cover edition"" when the ISBN comes up but the cover is different (those that don't have a cover but can be obtained legally for Goodreads' use is different and only a Goodreads Librarian can help and should never be re-added).

,


Goodreads Librarians recognize how annoying it is when adding one and the ISBN sends back an error. However, if you aren't a Goodreads Librarian, you'll want to hold off on clicking the ""Create book"" until all fields are filled out to their entirety.
Acknowledging where the error lays if you get the error message yourself is a big help, and can be remedied through an action that you can also take.


, Use the same conventional formats as those used in the above method (adding a brand new book to the database). These same conventions apply to adding alternate editions too.

, Make sure the Twitter user you sent it to is the official account of the user. Although any Internet user can sign up under alternate names, only one looks correct. The account may even say ""official account of"" someplace on the page underneath the Twitter username of their Twitter profile.

Create a persona for your dog.,
Choose a social media platform that works for you.,
Think of a social media name.",How to Create a Social Media Page for Your Dog1," Think of your dog's quirks or individual traits. Don't look at quirks or weirdness as a negative if your dog has some. Embrace these differences and use it as a positive when thinking of ideas for your dog's social media page. Think about details surrounding how your dog acts, and try to attribute human traits to them.

For instance, if your dog is always curious and getting into trouble, you can create a mischievous and sarcastic personality for them.
If your dog is really human-friendly and subdued, you can create a relaxed, friendly persona for your dog.;
, Consider the goals of your dog's social media page. Decide whether you are creating it to show off images of your pet or if you are creating it to post funny and quirky commentary. Certain social media platforms lend themselves to commentary while others are better for photos.In addition, you should pick one that you use personally so that you feel more comfortable using it.

If you're posting photos, platforms like Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest are great.
If you want to say witty things as your dog, Twitter or Facebook are good platforms.
If you post a lot of videos, consider a video sharing platform like Snapchat.

, Think of a memorable and catchy social media name for your dog. Try to integrate your dog's name into its social media name. Overly complex or hard to pronounce names should be avoided.

Famous social media dog account names include, @toastmeetsworld, @muppetsrevenge, and @jiffpom."

Create new accounts on your desired social media platforms.,
Fill in the profile information.,
Take a lot of photos of your dog.,
Photo-edit photos to meet the specifications for social media platforms.,
Launch your pet's page.",How to Create a Social Media Page for Your Dog2," Visit the website of your chosen social media platform and sign up for an account. Follow the instructions and complete the verification process. If you are required to put a last name, just put your own. Narrow down your options and choose one to three different platforms so that you can concentrate on building certain accounts first.

If creating an account on Facebook, make sure you use the ""Pages"" option instead of creating a real account, or it may get deleted.
Other platforms care less about ""fake"" accounts or accounts created for people's pets.
You may have to try multiple account names because they may have been already created.

, Think of entertaining or cute content that you can use to fill up your dog's profile page. Find a profile picture that embodies your dog's personality. Upload photos and videos that you've taken of your dog and share them with people that are following you so that they can like and share them with their networks.

If your dog is fun-loving and energetic, use a photo of them being active, like swimming or catching a ball.
If there is a place for hobbies you can put something like, ""running after squirrels, playing catch, and cuddling with my owner.""
Remember to include contact information for potential advertising opportunities.

, When you launch your dog's social media page, you'll want to make sure that you have enough content for people to look through. Try to catch your dog during candid moments when he's not paying attention to make photos more organic.Think of the photo's composition and whether it's capable of eliciting an emotion out of people who see it. Make sure that your dog remains the focal point of the picture and that it's interesting or impressive.

Turn off the flash, as it can often startle or scare dogs.
Try to capture times that make your dog interesting and unique.
If your dog is camera shy, try offering some treats to get them to open up.A panting dog often looks like they are smiling. If you want a happy looking dog, go for a brisk jog or walk with them before the photo shoot.
Make the background engaging and interesting to look at as well.

, Some portions of your dog's social media pages will require specific sized images. This means that you'll have to use a photo editing software to get them exactly right, or the page may look strange or broken to some people. Edit and resize the most important photos that are on your page.

For instance, the cover picture image size for Facebook is 851 x 315 pixels.
The header image for Twitter is 520 x 260 pixels.
The profile size for Pinterest is 165 x 165 pixels.Read how to Resize an Image in Adobe Photoshop.

, Once you finish all the details for your dog's social media pages you can alert all of the people in your social circle that your dog now has his own social media pages. Do this by posting a link on your own personal page, or sending an email to family and friends. Finally, you can start to add people that have met your dog or people that you know personally to gain friends or followers."

Interact with other pages and build a fanbase.,
Maintain a consistent posting schedule.,
Cater your content to your audience.",How to Create a Social Media Page for Your Dog3," Start by getting your pet's name out there. The more people that you interact with and follow, the more exposure for your pet's page. Commenting in a specific or humorous voice is usually a way to pique people's interest in your account.Using puns like ""I've got a bone to pick with your opinion"" may make people laugh and follow your dog's page.
Announcing landmarks for your dog's social media page is also another great way to thank followers or fans.

You can say something like ""Thank you, everyone, for helping me reach my goal of 1,000 followers!""



, If your posts don't show up on other people's feeds, your dog's page won't grow. Keep a consistent posting schedule and post for your dog at least once a day. Consider optimum posting times, depending on the platform that you'll be using for your pet.

The best time to post on Twitter is 3 p.m. Mondays through Fridays.
The best time to post on Facebook is 12 p.m. and 3 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday and on Saturday and Sunday between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m.
The best time to post on Instagram is 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. Monday through Friday., The first step in catering content specifically to your target audience is to understand your audience. Try to cater the content that you put out for that audience. Take note of which posts get the most likes, shares, or comments. Pay attention to trends to figure out what content is most successful on your pages.When a post gets a lot of likes or comments, you should try to create similar content in the future. For instance, you may get few likes or shares on long posts comprised of text, but many on cute pictures of your dog in funny costumes.

Attempt to prevent them leaving in the first place.,
Leave a message, if possible.,
Make the message nice and thought provoking.,
If you promise to do anything, then make sure you do it.,
E-mail the person if you have the e-mail address.,
Make sure to emphasize, however you get to the person, that you have really not met him/her in real life.,
Attempt to keep in contact through e-mail or mail.,
Seek to understand from their view.,
If nothing goes well, then accept the truth for what it is.",How to Cope if a Friend Leaves a Website," Be kind to them. If you can sense that you are annoying the friend, back off a little bit. If this friend is having trouble (i.e. being bullied) then step in and help! This may possibly stop someone from leaving, or lessen the chances.

, This is certainly possible on wikiHow. While you may not think so, chances are, this person will surely check his/her messages more. It does not hurt to check and they surely will look.;
, Begging them to come back, ""hey, please come back!!!!"" is not good enough. Begging will only annoy them and tire them out. Write a nice letter with good punctuation even if this is not normal for you. In the letter, ask nicely why they left. State all the reasons to stay on the website, and that you will miss them. For example:


Dear Friend,
I have realized that you have quit wikiHow recently. I would like to help you reconsider. While it is perfectly fine not to be addicted, it is quite alright to be on here sometimes :). We met on this site and it is what we have in common. Think of what will happen to your friendships if you leave. You were a great editor here. You suffered some problems, but I will talk to an administrator about fixing this. Please give it one more chance before making the final choice.""

, You want to be a very trusted person.

, If others were close to the person, inquire with them; perhaps they have a way of contacting the person. Phone is okay too.

, Therefore, leaving is only more tragic.

, Sometimes, people just cannot be convinced to come back.

, Perhaps life has been busy for them. They might have more important, significant things to do in life. If you had to take care of your kids, attend night college courses, do the house chores, and cook, where would wikiHow rank?

, Be reasonable. It is okay to feel bad for a little while. Then, you have to move on. You will always make new friends. While a lifetime includes several friends, some of them are not lifelong and you have to accept this. If you think about it, in twenty years from now, is it very likely you would be in contact with this person?

Make sure to find a good flag for your country.,
Set up a very thorough group ""description"".,
Set up ranks.,
Create uniforms.,
Create a fort.,
Start by recruiting close friends.,
Recruit from a wider group.,
Try running ads.,
Remember to stay active.",How to Create a Colonial Group on ROBLOX," To create a group, you will need a rank of Builder's Club and 100 robux. You must think of an original country. If you cannot think of a country yourself, check out a map! Some examples of what not to do are Britain, Spain and France. These are common countries that do not attract interest.

If the name of your country is taken, you can add various symbols to bypass this. An example is "" • The British Empire • "".;
, Try to avoid getting flags off of the internet, rather get the general flag without any or little shading and shade it yourself.



 

, This is the area below the group title. This can be a first impression for experienced players, so try to avoid grammar or spelling mistakes. An example of a good group description may include symbols like ""♜"" or ""▬""., It is very attractive to make group ranks in the same language as the country it represents. For example, if you ran a German group the rank for Enlistment might be ""Anwerbung"". Also, add titles to the front of the name. You can have LR (low rank), MR (middle rank), HR (high rank) and R (royal) or HC (high command). This can be good for distinguishing who wears what uniform., Uniforms are very complicated. You can watch advanced tutorials or hire someone to make them for you. If you do make them yourself, avoid solid colors and rather shade like you did for the flag. You should distinguish ranks (LRs, MRs, HRs etc.) with the uniforms. You can use things like sashes, gold or silver colors, etc.

, A fort is a place where you can train your troops and host raids and rallies. To create your fort, it will require a lot of time and skill. You can either learn complex building techniques, or you can hire somebody to make a fort for you. If you do a fort yourself, avoid free models. You can ask any friends you might have that have interest in the colonial era to borrow weapons such as muskets and cannons., Remember, friends can recruit their friends, and they can recruit their friends, etc. Just don't try to give too high of ranks away., After you have a few friends in your army, arrange a recruiting session at the popular Group Recruiting Plaza. Remember to dress well, everybody in uniform. Also, you can try recruiting in colonial cities such as the popular City of London by CapnDom.





, Make sure your ads are very professional, no vibrant colors. You can have group members pose for epic-looking ad pictures., Host daily trainings, promote trustworthy people and tell officers to host their own trainings as well. You can also create a city of your own to patrol and recruit at. Make sure to let civilians buy weapons and have some sort of rebel team. Soon enough, you will have a powerful, successful army!"

Consider reach.,
Consider ownership.,
Consider what you offer on your website that might not be transferable to Facebook.,
Consider conversation.,
Think about longevity.,
Consider ease of information gathering.,
Go for balance.",How to Decide Between Facebook or a Website for Your Company," Compare the figures of visitors to your website and the visitors to your Facebook site. These might be telling in favor of Facebook but hold your excitement. Exactly what is this telling you? Are the customers your business seeks, other businesses you interact with, or your demographic the ones on Facebook too?


Which people are looking at your Facebook pages and which people are looking at your website? Do you know for certain they're one and the same people or are you actually capturing a far wider pool of people – those who prefer Facebook and those who prefer websites?
Not everyone is a Facebook contributor or user. And there remain many people for whom the internet is a mere tool and not a socializing instrument. Such people look for facts, information, and reputation from a website; they are not likely to spend the time setting up Facebook accounts or being convinced by the Facebook stream of consciousness as a solution to their search needs.;
, Who owns your materials? On a website, your company owns those materials and it is your company that decides what to do with those materials. You can take stuff down today or never on a website; the only things you need to comply with are your ISP's requirements and the laws of your country. With Facebook, you have the layer of Facebook's rules over your material and while the material is still yours, Facebook has the ability to remove things it considers in contravention of its rules. Moreover, it is Facebook, not your company, that owns data collected via Facebook.

, Do you have interactive features such as a game, a color changing system for clothing/paint etc. or a diagram that can be shifted around, etc., a huge range of product displays, lengthy information? These sorts of things don't work on Facebook and belong on a website. On the other hand, you can condense some of your lengthy information into shorter ""teaser"" articles or information to place on Facebook, with a link at the base that encourages readers back to your site if they want to learn more.

, Conversing with people is what Facebook is for. Forums and email contact have their place but are static and time-delayed. Facebook can allow you to be responsive quickly and in a manner that feels like a connected conversation with a customer.

, The internet morphs all the time and the only real certainty is that those responsible for the internet communications of your company need to be in the loop of the changes as they occur and take a foothold over the internet community. For now, wondering how much of a role Facebook should play in your company's communications strategy is probably the most current issue but Facebook will have its phase before something else takes over. Therefore, always think about how you can store the information and communications in their best manner possible for future retrieval, reuse, and historical purposes. Again, it may be that a website that works for this purpose, or you may simply prefer to not be concerned about retaining what has lost currency. Whatever you decided, be sure to look into the future in terms of what is best for your company.

, Clicking like is easy on Facebook, while web forms are not. However, people are clicking like everywhere these days and it is a lazy shortcut way of being seen to be involved with things. It doesn't necessarily mean loyalty, attachment, or even an intention to keep paying attention to your company's pages. Information gathered via a website is your company's database information and you can personalize all follow-ups with the customers or clients as needed.

, At the end of the day, you may be best to have both for now as well as keeping a continual eye on what is trending in terms of reader's online preferences. So, have a website that is up-to-date and reflecting all that online searchers are looking for in layout, ease of search, and excellent content. And a Facebook account that both complements your website and provides more than your website.

Communicate more directly with your partner.",How to Deal With Relationship Issues on Facebook," How many people can read your posts? If you have your privacy settings set to ""Everyone"", even complete strangers will be able to view your messages. Consider whether you really want that.;
, How many people are your ""friends"" on Facebook? Even if your privacy is set to ""Friends only"", did you ""friend"" your mailman and your second-grade teacher? Do you want them to know about your relationship worries? How many people will read this on your partner's page?

, Pretend that everyone who reads your posts is sitting in the same room with you. How would you act? What kind of information would you share? You are dealing with very personal issues. If you wouldn't talk about something to someone ""in the real world"", don't do it on the internet! Once you put information into the web, chances are it will outlast the reason why you put it there and you have very little control over what happens to it.

, This is not just about you. If your partner upset you, it obviously involves him/her as well, but quite probably ONLY them and you. You might be sitting at home and tempted to find an outlet for your frustration, but broadcasting it all over the place will very likely make things worse, not better. If you think screaming the message you are dying to send from your balcony would be crazy, don't post it on Facebook! It's like a huge balcony with lots of people under it.

, Not only will your partner be upset that you dragged up to several hundred people into your relationship (and that really is a crowd!), probably you will seem rash and rude to everyone who reads it, so if nothing else, you are making yourself look really bad. Most of your Facebook friends probably would feel very uncomfortable being confronted with such personal information. It might make them feel awkward whenever they are around you or your partner.

, If you want to get rid of some negative feelings, go ahead and write them down. Take some time and breathe deeply. Read what you wrote down. Then decide whether you want to share these thoughts with your partner and how you want to go about it.

, Either meet them, or call them on the phone. Find a way to resolve your differences without embarrassing yourself or them in front of others. A good method of achieving this is by using nonviolent communication.

You can blend into the crowd with a name like John Smith, or you can stand out with an outlandish name such as Aloysius Cornwisky. Just be aware that the more outlandish the name, the less likely you'll be seen as being ""real."" After all, Aloysius has not been in the top 1000 baby names any time in the last 50 years!Whatever you choose, there's no restriction on duplicate names.

, Use a service such as Yahoo, Gmail, or Hotmail to create an anonymous account. Not only are they free, you'd need a court order to learn the identity of the real person behind the fake name.

, While anybody can have a name, photos tell the story. As the saying goes, ""Pictures, or it didn't happen.""


Avoid using images from Google, or from stock photo websites, or any other public site—those are too easily investigated by anybody, thanks to Google Images. To test if your image is easily discoverable, navigate to images.google.com, and drag your image into the search field. If it can be found on the web, Google Images will find it.
Some possible alternatives include dating sites such as Zoosk or Match.com, Flickr, Tumblr, and even that ""other"" social media website, Myspace.
It's even harder for Google images to find screenshots of newly uploaded YouTube videos. Search a keyword for the image you want to find on YouTube (or another video-sharing site), then select ""upload date"" under filters. It might be hard to find a relevant video, but the photo (unless it's the thumbnail of the video) will not be easy to discover.
Avoid using other Facebook accounts, as their sophisticated facial recognition algorithms might cause you to accidentally tag somebody's image, who would then be on to your ruse. It could cost you your fake account, and primary account as well!
If you're in your late teens or early twenties, Vampire Freaks is loaded with images, but they are discoverable with Google Images.
Once you find a profile picture, make sure there are other pictures of that person for later use. If you want to use multiple people as ""you,"" make sure you pay attention to details like nose type, lips, skin color, hair cut and color, height, weight, eye color, and various other attributes.
Many people use childhood pictures for their Facebook profile, or even pictures of a cat, a favorite sports team, or even a shrubbery—there's no specific need to put a picture of any face at all in your profile.

, As you build a profile for your alt, you will want a place or community for it to ""Rabat""


Your alt can live in the same town as you, or can live on the other side of the world!
Search for middle schools, high schools, or colleges in that area, and add them to your page.
Pick several different things for each category in the interests section. For music pick bands you like that fit the style of the character you're creating .

, Talk about yourself—but remember, you're not talking about the ""real"" you, you're creating a character. You can be younger than you are, or older. You can even be the opposite sex!


The more details you add, the more convincing your fake account will be. Just be careful to ""act"" the part you're playing.

, Search for people in your alt's hometown that look like they might be interesting. If they have a lot of friends, even better. The goal here is to build a network of ""friends,"" and by finding people who have a very large number of friends, you'll accomplish two things:


First, if their list is huge, there's no way they know everybody on the list well. Find out their main interests, and when you friend them, say something like ""Hey, remember me? We met at the concert last week."" They'll just assume you met, and friend you back.
Second, if they have that many friends, you will soon have mutual friends—even friends that are not quite as well known. That way, you can say ""Hi, remember me? I was with Joe Popular at the concert last week.""
Friend people of both sexes. That will really help you develop a well-rounded profile.
Do not add people you know! If you get a lot of people saying you're fake, just ignore them and move on. Keep adding people, and get to know them on chat and messages.

, Update your profile pic and cover photo from time to time, and make sure you attend events in ""your"" neighborhood.


Set up Twitter, Yelp, and Instagram accounts, and check in at various places around town. By keeping it current, you will give the impression that you are the real deal.

, The first step in creating your very own survey is by putting some basic details about it such as:



Survey Title—Enter a short title about your survey. Make it witty, like “Hey, car lovers! We want your thoughts,” to help catch the attention of readers and increase the chance of them answering your question.

Survey Language—Click the drop-down list and select the language you’d like your survey to be in.

Description—Type in a short description about your survey on the text box provided. Though there’s no limit on the number of characters to use, it’s recommended to use a short description that can be quickly read by people.
Once you’re done, click the “Next” button to proceed to the next step.

, The survey app will ask for your permission to access your profile and your email address. Just click the “Okay” button to allow the app and continue to the second step.

, The second step is to add the inquiries you want to put on your survey. Click the “Add Question” you see on the web page to bring up the New Question pop-up window. Type in your survey question and choose the question type you’d like to use:



One-line text box—Participants can enter a one-line answer on a text box.

Multiple lines comment box—Participants can type in their answers using as many lines as they want.

Multiple choices—Participants can pick out one or more answer from a list of choices.

Drop-down list—Participants can select only one answer from a drop-down list of choices.

Scale of 1 to 5—Participants can pick any number from 1 to 5 as their response.

Picture upload—Participants can upload and use pictures as their answers for the survey.

, If you chose a question type that lets users pick between answers (Multiple Choice and Drop-Down List), you may enter the survey answers you’d like to put in the survey on the text field, provided on the lower portion of the New Question pop-up window. Once you’re done, click the “Save” button to save all the details you’ve entered.

, The last step will be to share the survey you created. Click the “Share” button you see on the app page, and click the “Post on Timeline” to publish it on your Facebook profile.

, You’ll receive a notification on the top right corner of your Facebook page whenever someone answers your survey. Just click the notification to view the answers to your survey post.

, What kind of effect do you want to achieve? Do you simply want to make a feature available to your clients? Knowing what you want your app to do will make it easier for you to accomplish that goal.Try to have as clear an image in your head as possible. In the event that you don't have programming skills, you may have to describe what you want to someone who will then write the code for your application. A clear image of this will make conveying what you need to your programmer a cinch.

, You never know what will make your app go viral and create a boom in business, but by brainstorming and demoing content before release, you will have a much clearer idea of what will work and what will not.

, Even if your app is highly functional, poor integration with Facebook can make it look unprofessional or unfinished, which might put off other users. High resolution images, cool graphics, and clean formatting don't guarantee your success, but these will go a long way towards making your app a contender among professionally produced apps.

, How will users communicate with you through the app, and how will you communicate with your users? Think about the kind of people who will be using your app and what they will want to know. Then think about how you can deliver this information through your app. Other things to keep in mind:


What should users see in the application box on their profile page?
Why should users visit their Canvas page regularly?
What incentives are there for users to invite their friends?

, Especially if you are working with a team, but even if you are working by yourself or a single programmer on this project, make sure you come up with a schedule you feel is fair and confirm it with your team.Some aspects of programming will take longer than others, so be aware that your schedule might change to account for those difficulties.


Setting a development schedule will help keep you on task while establishing valuable work standards for your team.

, Here you can find tutorials, explanations, and tools to make your Facebook app the best possible. This is also where you will register as a developer and download the developer app.

, This is as simple as clicking the My Apps button from the top navigation bar and agreeing with the terms and conditions in the subsequent pop-up box. After accepting terms and conditions you'll be ready to use Facebook Canvas.

, Facebook refers to the blank pages where your app content will live as ""canvases."" On the developer website, select Canvas by clicking on ""My Apps"" from the top navigation bar, clicking ""Add New App"" in the following drop-down menu, and selecting ""Facebook Canvas"" as your platform.

, Click the docs tab in your top blue navigation bar to reach the Documentation homepage, or go to: ""developers.facebook.com/docs/"". In the left panel you should see several options, including ""Games"" towards the top of the panel. Click on games, and third from the top you should see ""Canvas"". Here you can familiarize yourself with all the properties of Facebook Canvas., You can do so by selecting ""My Apps"" from your top, blue navigation bar, choosing ""Add New App"" from the drop-down menu, or you can simply input the following URL: developers.facebook.com/apps. Click ""Create a New App"" by clicking the green button to the right of the page.


Facebook will check your app name to see if it's available before allowing you to continue.

, As part of Facebook's authentication and security, you will have to verify that you are the user you say you are and that you are human. You will likely have to provide some personal information, like your phone number or credit card information, and input Captcha text to prove you aren't a bot.

, Your app on Facebook, though now created, has no content. You will need to make use of either sample code, write code yourself, or have a third party develop your content. This is where your brainstorming comes in handy!

, You'll need to make a change to your account settings for you to be able to view the page. Unless you pay for app to be hosted securely, it will only be available to the people you indicate through your settings. Access account settings by clicking the rightmost drop-down tab in your blue navigation bar. In the panel to the left, you should see the ""Security"" heading, which you can click to access a new menu, the top of which will read ""Secure Browsing."" You will need to deactivate this feature and save changes.

Log into Twitter.,
Check your conversation rate.,
Check the amplification rate.,
Check the applause rate.,
Calculate the engagement rate.",How to Measure Twitter Engagement3," On a new browser tab, visit the Twitter website. Enter your registered email address and password into the fields, and click “Sign in” to proceed.

, To get your conversation rate, you must get the “Number of Replies per Tweet.” To do this, divide the “Total number of Replies” by the “Total number of tweets.”


The total number of tweets is the number below the “Tweets” option in the header.
You can check the number of replies by counting and adding them manually, or by creating a MySQL table. After creating the table, enter the specific details like content, time, and date of each tweet, and it will give you the total number of replies.
This method is relatively tricky when compared with others and will need patience to achieve precision. For instance, Total number of tweets in your account = 3,000. Total number of replies = 1,000. Therefore, your number of replies per tweet = 1000/3000 = 0.33.

, You need to check the your reach among your follower’s followers. To check this, you will need the “Number of retweets per tweet.” To get the “Number of retweets per tweet,” divide the “Total number of RTs” with your “Total number of tweets.” Again, the number of retweets is also achieved with a MySQL table.

, This rate gives you a keen idea of what the audience likes most on your profile. To check this, get the “Number of favourites per tweet”: divide the “Total number of favourites” with the “Total number of tweets.”


For instance: Total number of tweets = 3,000. Total number of favourites = 1,500. Therefore, the number of favourites per tweet = 1500/3000 = 0.5.

, Calculate the engagement rate by taking a geometric rate of above three rates. If “a” is the conversion rate, “b” is the amplification rate, “c” is the applause rate: (abc)^⅓ is the the geometric mean; that is the engagement rate. Example: cube root of (0.5*0.2*0.33) = 0.31.

, Hashtags are a huge part of Twitter and can be used to your advantage. You can put your product under #eBay or under a category that the product falls in, like #Fashion, #Starwars, or #Toys.

, While you don't want to be screaming 24/7 at your followers to buy your products, it's a good idea to actually advertise, rather than simply stating that you are selling something. Point out if it's been handmade, gently used or new, a large memory for electronics, or any other features that it has to its advantage.

Decide on what service you'd like to broadcast.,
Get the needed training.,
Have your supplies.,
Begin broadcasting.,
Have a time period.",How to Sell on Twitter3," Do you want to babysit? Mow lawns? Organize and clean rooms? The choice is yours, but be sure you're happy with it, because once you begin advertising, it's hard to change your mind.

, Obviously, you won't be able to mow lawns if you don't know how to start a lawnmower. Talk to your parents or a friend if you need help to do what you're thinking of. Some services, such as babysitting, will even have classes offered by local colleges, schools, or other facilities.

, If you're raking leaves, provide your own rake; don't mooch off the person who is using your services. Be sure that whatever you need, you can take with you.

, Once you're completely ready, let Twitter know that you're selling services. If you want, you can start a hashtag for your 'business', like #Milly'sSmartphoneRepairs or #123babysitting so that users can start a post with your hashtag to request services.

, If you'll only be able to work during the summer or on weekends, let your followers know in the post. It will prevent your customers from getting refused without warning.

Know when to use manual retweeting.,
Start a new tweet with the prefix ""RT"".,
Write ""@"" and the username of the person you're retweeting.,
Copy the tweet you want to share with your followers.,
Add your own comment to the tweet.,
Click the ""Tweet"" button to post.",How to Retweet2," Manual retweeting, also known as classic retweeting, is when you copy and paste a tweet into the text box and tweet it from your own account. It is generally thought of as a better way to retweet, as it allows you to add your own questions and comments to the tweet (as long as you keep the entire thing under 140 characters). With this option, there is also a better chance that the original tweeter will notice your retweet.With the classic Twitter web interface you will need to manually copy and paste the text you wish to retweet, however when you use Twitter on the iPhone, or get the ""Classic Retweet"" extension for Chrome or Firefox, they will automatically copy the text while still giving you the option to edit before posting.Be aware that manually retweeting content without adding comment is viewed as poor Twitter etiquette in many circles, as it appears as though you are taking credit for the tweet, while also denying the original tweeter the possibility of gaining more retweets., This is an abbreviation of the word ""retweet"". Follow the letter RT with a single space.


It is also possible to simply write the word ""retweet"", but this is not very efficient, especially when you're limited to 140 characters!

, Only the username is required, not the person or company's full name. For example, if you wanted to retweet wikiHow, you would write ""RT @wikihow"".


This step is necessary to give credit to the original tweeter and to make sure that the retweet appears in their feed., Paste it into the text box, after the ""RT @ username"". Delete any unnecessary characters and double check URLs for accuracy.


If the text is too long, you can abbreviate it by changing ""and"" to ""&"" and ""to"" to ""2"", etc. However, be wary of making any changes that alter the meaning of the tweet, or of omitting important details.

, As long as the whole tweet stays under 140 characters, you can add any comments or questions before you post. Usually people will write in their own content before the ""RT"", at the start of the tweet, but it is also possible to include the comment after the copied content.


Your own comment doesn't need to be long or very deep -- it can be something as simple as ""Love this!"" or ""Must read!"".
As long as your comment is saying something positive, your retweet can be seen as a compliment to the original tweeter and may even get you a reply!

, Post the tweet as normal. It will show up in your followers' feeds as well as in the feed of the original tweeter.

Simply tweet that your business is looking for an ""XYZ"" person who can do ""XYZ"" and provide a short URL to the job specs. Ask for it to be retweeted about to increase the interest.


Make the tweet interesting and leave all the details to the webpage the URL directs people too. Remember that Twitter is about short, sweet and catchy.

, This can tease people and make them think that they'd like to work for you when there are vacancies or to make the effort of sending in their interest even without an active call for applicants.

Quote a tweet in-text by incorporating it into the sentence.,
Cite the tweet in your footnotes.,
Alternatively, cite the tweet in a bibliography.",How to Quote a Tweet4," You do not need to include a parenthetical citation for a tweet in Chicago Style. You may, however, introduce the author's name and username before quoting the tweet itself.


When quoting a tweet, write the author's full name in the sentence followed by the @username in parentheses.
If desired, you can also introduce the quote as a Twitter post and indicate the day the tweet was published.
Example: In a Twitter post on July 18, 2013, John Doe (@JohnDoeExampleName) wrote, ""Quoting a tweet is surprisingly simple.""
Example: In a Twitter post on July 18, 2013, RandomExampleUsername found quoting tweets to be ""so simple, even a monkey could do it.""

, Follow an in-text quote with a footnote if you are using a standard Chicago Style form of reference that includes footnotes instead of a Bibliography page.


Write the author's real name in FirstName LastName format, followed by a comma.
Indicate that the quote is a “Twitter post.” Follow this with another comma.
Write the date of the tweet's publication and the time of publication, separated by and followed with two more commas.
Conclude with the user's Twitter URL. End with a period.
Example: John Doe, Twitter post, July 18, 2013, 1:00 p.m., https://twitter.com/JohnDoeExampleName.
Example: RandomExampleUsername, Twitter post, July 18, 2013, 1:00 p.m., https://twitter.com/RandomExampleUsername.

, If you are using a Bibliography page instead of a footnote system, include the same information in a bibliographic reference.


The information you include will be the same as the information used for a footnote, but the punctuation varies.
Write the author's real name in LastName, FirstName format, followed by a period.
Indicate that the quote is a “Twitter post.” Follow this with another period.
Write the date of the tweet's publication and the time of publication, separated by a comma and followed by a period.
Conclude with the user's Twitter URL. Do not end with a period.
Example: Doe, John. Twitter post. July 18, 2013, 1:00 p.m. https://twitter.com/JohnDoeExampleName

Example: RandomExampleUsername. Twitter post. July 18, 2013, 1:00 p.m. https://twitter.com/RandomExampleUsername

",How to Quit Twitter," It's helpful to let your thoughts about this fairly irreversible action gel by writing them down. Consider doing this the old-fashioned way—pen on paper as you sit somewhere comfortable. Away from the computer, your resolve to quit might be strengthened and you might also come up with more reasons for cutting the cord, including:


You're spending too much time on Twitter.
Your head is full of the world as your followers see it. You're reading all their links, soaking up all their viewpoints, and you're wondering if you even have a mind of your own anymore.
It's boring. Twitter has a natural funneling effect that leaves many users with like-minded followers. You probably already worked that out the first time you said something that disagreed with followers who are not like-minded and they unfollowed you. Twitter is a natural filter that leaves you with a majority of followers on your wavelength. That can be a source of relief, or it can be boring when there is no dissension or questioning of viewpoints. For sure, nobody wants to be at the receiving end of trolling, but robust debate is not something the majority of Twitter accounts welcome or even accept!
It's a numbers game. For a large group of people, Twitter's following system has become a numbers game. When it comes to thinking ""How many followers have I got?; ""How many has X got?""; and ""He who has the most Twitter followers at death wins"", then it's probably a very good time for you to reassess the whole point of being a part of Twitter! Worse than boring, this is digital competitive dullness.
You're feeling compelled to make constant updates, just to keep your account ""exciting"" for your followers even though it's lost its edge for you. This can make you feel harassed, or just worn out!
Your only followers are companies. What sort of relationship can you really have with employees who are bound to speak their company mind?;
, There are several possibilities open to you, depending on the results sought:


Don't delete, just rely on self-disciplined weaning. Leave messages telling people that you're on a ""Twitter break"", or that you're traveling to Alaska on a three-legged donkey and don't know when you'll be back. Of course, this kind of ""quitting"" is a half measure that leaves the door wide open for you to convince yourself you don't really want to quit and tomorrow might very well see you right back at it, retweeting everything that pops up before you. Beware of this option if you really want to quit!
Remove all of your followers. A bold and furious statement, one likely to engender a flurry of ""Hey, what the heck are you doing?"" and ""Who do you think you are"" tweets and many unfollows. If that's the sort of reaction you're looking for, go for it. The only problem with this is that... you're still a part of Twitter and the temptation to resurrect the account awaits.

Delete your Twitter account. Final, this represents closure, and you can move on. You have not only quit, but you've removed your brand building and essence of what is you online, all in one fell swoop.

, Twitter withdrawal symptoms can occur, especially if you were a heavy user. Here are some symptoms that might appear post the Twit-quit:


You have a compulsion to keep checking Twitter.
You have a compulsion to add TweetBits of information. A link here, a 140 word comment there, an RT of something curious.
Watch those Twitter tabs on websites everywhere! You may feel an urge to click ""Tweet me"" or ""Share"". Of course, if your account has gone, it won't work but the ghost of the action will remind you of your former Twitter self...
You miss some of your Twitter friends. If you were sensible, you hooked up with the best of them prior to quitting and have their emails still.

, If you're popular, you might be at the receiving end of other people's astonishment, disgust, annoyance, or unhappiness at your decision to quit. Or, they might be saying bravo, and lauding your courage. Either way, the email aftermath can be disarming.Be aware that if you have another source of being known online, that your followers may find their way to your email address and start pinging you with their personal opinions about your Twit-quit.
Even if you can't be tracked down elsewhere, be aware that you might be a blog target for complaints, ""lessons learned"", or anything the blogger feels like conjuring up!

, If you're feeling fine and very glad that you've quit Twitter, then that's great! If not, it's important to be gentle on your post-Twitter self – things to help you cope may include:


Find other distractions. Make them good ones that you really enjoy, from sport, to a hobby, from spending time with your friends, to renovating the house. Email your friends, or give them a call, and a have a real conversation.
Keep being internet savvy. Twitter is a current phenomenon. It doesn't have to discolor your view of the rest of your internet usage, nor do you have to paint yourself as some sort of technological Luddite. Find the best 3–4 news sites and stick with those to keep yourself informed. Subscribe to your favorite blogs or interest sites to keep you informed on the areas that interest you. If you need a refreshing tangent, use the search engine!
View yourself as a discerning customer, a savvy user, a person with a mind of your own who has decided to prioritize other things online. And that's OK, really. No matter what the Twitter defenders insist.

Be proud that you've stood out from the crowd and done something that many others secretly wish they could do too but lack the something that leads them to quitting for real.

, The final message for someone quitting is to trust that you know enough to live well, and that you don't need the constant barrage of advice from others in the Twittersphere. You don't stop learning just because you've stopped the Twitter stream; you remain open to all other avenues of learning. And you will probably find you've got more time now, and less need to tell everyone what your latest mundane thought actually is!

Sign up or log in to your Twitter account.,
Appoint someone to start using the Twitter account for your business or event.,
Start following people on Twitter.,
Use the hashtag with the words ""#deal,"" ""#voucher"" ""#coupon,"" or ""#bargain,"" to post sales on products or tickets.,
Pay attention to trending topics on Twitter, which are linked by popular hashtags.,
Create your own hashtag before a new promotion or event.,
Create a contest or raffle that encourages users to post Tweets with a specific hashtag.",How to Promote with Twitter Hashtags," Enter your account information and click ""Sign up for Twitter."" You will want to provide an attractive description of your event or business and upload a picture or icon.;
, Consistency is essential on Twitter because it is constantly being updated. Make sure the person understands how to navigate and communicate via Twitter.


Users type the ""@"" symbol to directly message other users. This can be useful if someone has commented on a post. It is usually used to create and continue conversations between users and to pass on links.
Users type the ""#,"" or hash symbol to follow trending topics on the site. For example, ""#london"" would be called a ""hashtag"" and it would be used in a tweet to talk about something going on in London, England. You can click on a hashtag to find out all of the tweets that discuss this topic.

, Most people choose to get updates about who follows them on Twitter. Each person who you follow may in turn choose to follow you and receive your updates.

, Many people use these words daily to look up deals and save money. Other sites aggregate all the tweets that include those hashtags in the post.


Popular aggregation sites include CheapTweet, DealUniversity and Dealyzer.

, Use a trending topic whenever it applies to your event or business. It will show up to people who are searching using that hashtag, and it will help you to gain followers and promotion for your business.


Try to avoid using political or news-related hashtags that have nothing to do with your business to increase sales. Although this is not outlawed, it is seen as a somewhat corrupt approach to Twitter hashtag marketing. For example, Kenneth Cole used the hashtag ""#Cairo,"" during the Cairo riots in 2011 to promote its spring line of clothing, which resulted in both increased sales and bad press.

, The term should be short and easy to remember, such as ""#DylanLive,"" to promote a series of concerts by Bob Dylan. Create your term months or weeks in advance so that you can include it on all of your promotional materials.


Begin using your new hashtag on Twitter, while you include it in press releases, on tickets, or on websites. Encourage other employees to announce it on stage. Ask promotional partners to use it on all of their marketing materials.
Continue using the hashtag in daily tweets. You can also respond to people, using the ""@"" symbol, who use your hashtag to give positive updates on your event or promotion.
If done properly and consistently, a hashtag promotion can effectively employ other people as promoters of your work. Their followers will see the hashtag and may choose to follow you or the promotion as it unfolds.

, Promote the competition in your store, and ask users to follow your company's Twitter handle as a precondition for participating. You'll get more followers, increase interest in your cupcakes, and create a trending Twitter hashtag.


For example, let's say you own a bakery called Cupcakes Delight. You can ask your customers to tweet the best picture of them enjoying a cupcake in a unique location with the hashtag #TravelingwithCupcakeDelight. The best picture/caption combination will receive a year's worth of free cupcakes.

Request Retweets.",How to Promote a Crowdfunding Campaign on Twitter," Share your campaign on Twitter and increase your word count by adding a personal message. Tell your supporters about your cause, why you need their help and how their contributions will help you. A tweet is like a short Facebook status update. The difference is that every tweet arrives at every follower’s feed, unlike the filter of Facebook’s algorithm.;
, You should use words that you think will make an impact on your followers. Add some compelling details of your cause to this tweet to catch follower’s attention. Keep is simple – tweets with less than 100 characters have a 17% higher rate of engagement than longer tweets do.

,  Go to Twitter Search and find out if there is any conversation about a cause or project similar to yours, what people are talking about it and whether you can join or start a conversation. It will help you reach more people.

, Twitter is about connecting to people, building your own community. To reach out to as many people as possible you should start following people you know, people in your neighborhood, non-profit organizations and communities related to your cause. Twitter can help you find people you know by scanning your email address book.

, Make sure to include relevant and popular hashtags! (Find lists of popular hashtags here). You can have a hashtag that enables anyone to find your project easily. On the other hand, using relevant hashtags you get engaged in different Twitter community, which members can then tweet and Retweet your campaign several times a day. It allows you to maximize the promotion of your campaign to its fullest potential possible. You can reach out to as many people as you can without having to do it all by yourself. Remember, with hashtags other people can easily find and tweet or retweet your campaign.

, People love to look at pictures, so include photographs in your tweets whenever possible. Twitter adds every photo you share to a photo gallery. The first six appear on your profile page. Take advantage of this feature to tell a visual story of your cause. Be sure to let people know when the link is a photo by adding before the image.

, Are you looking for more retweets? Just ask your followers. A tweet’s retweet rate increases 12 times when you ask followers for a retweet. Asking followers to retweet using the whole word “Retweet” (instead of the short and casual “RT”) increases retweet rates by 23 times.

,, First, if you are mentioning a third party or replying to their tweet, type out their handle. Then, add a ""tweet counter"", like ""1/3""—the purpose will be explained at the next steps.

, Hold off on publishing it for now.

,, Type the same Twitter handle and counter, but this time, change the numbers to ""2/3"". Then, paste the text, again making sure you're within 140 characters.


The tweet counter indicates that the content is too long to be sent in one tweet, and that the entire tweet is split into multiple, successive tweets. In this example, ""1/3"" is interpreted as the first tweet out of three tweets, ""2/3"" means second tweet out of three tweets, and so on.

, Once your whole tweet has been split, go ahead and publish them individually.

Think like your readers.,
Learn from other successful (and unsuccessful) people on Twitter.,
Grab the reader's attention.,
Use correct and acceptable punctuation.,
Use correct spelling.",How to Write a Good Tweet," This is a bit of a no-brainer, but it’s easily overlooked. For your tweet to be perfect, it needs to appeal most to your readers, to the majority of your network, and not to you.


Unless you’re a world-famous celebrity or brand with millions of devoted followers, adopting an attitude of ‘they’ll know what I mean’ or ‘everybody likes this!’ will almost always backfire.
You have to take the time to craft your tweet accurately and pleasingly, thus ensuring that it will be appeal to the highest number of readers.;
, Take a moment to peruse your Twitter feed. Refresh the page. Who stands out? Why?

, Conversely, there are many times when we suddenly notice the tweet of somebody we’ve only recently started following, or have previously not paid much attention to, because it was excellent. It ticked all of our boxes, and we read the tweet and clicked on that retweet button.

, Almost nobody is likely to be offended or put off when they read something that paid attention to the correct use of punctuation. The opposite is not true – many people (enormous numbers if you use the internet as a gauge) feel that, rightly or wrongly, missing or an incorrect use of punctuation reflects poorly on the writer.


Use full stops and commas. Put your apostrophes in the right place. Use speech marks and parentheses.
Don’t end every sentence with an exclamation mark. A simple hyphen can often be the difference between a real word and one that doesn’t exist.

, If you’re a bad speller, or struggle with grammar, consider writing your tweets in your favourite word processor first. This might seem unnecessary, or even patronizing, but let me just echo the sentiments above – people will judge you on how you write, and how you spell, and this will have a direct impact on whether your links are clicked and your updates retweeted.

, The key to the successful use of social media promotion is consistency. This person should be prepared to use the company objectives to tweet at least once per day, if not more, and answer tweets that are directed at the website's Twitter account.

, Spend 2 weeks to a month posting about the website, the industry, current events, comedy and professional culture. Few people follow brand new accounts, so it is important to start developing a community-friendly voice before you start looking for followers.


Follow people who you think are interesting and who have a lot of followers. A referral from a popular or interesting Twitter user will spread your website's reach.

, Follow 10 to 100 every week to slowly build up your following. Many people receive alerts from people who follow them, and then follow your account in turn.


This should not be the only way you garner followers. It is often regarded as ""spamming"" when done in large groups. You should only do a small number at a time, and try to build followers through consistent promotions, community posts and witty or sincere communication with your other followers.

, Twitter's community approach means that people do not like a ""hard sell"" on your website or your products. Focus your posts on building a culture, brand and community voice around your website content.

, Many businesses and professionals make mistakes by syncing all their social media. Twitter is a shorter format that requires you to craft minimal text that still grabs attention.


Think of your tweet as your article headline. Decide if you were reading a newspaper and you saw that headline, if you would choose to read further. How well you write your tweets will determine how many people visit your website.

, This is a Twitter-based device that tags your post and allows people to click on a keyword to find many posts about the same topic. You need to include a ""#"" hash symbol before your keyword to correctly use the hashtag.


For example, instead of writing ""Today's deal is $5 off a Mad Men-inspired cardigan,"" write ""Today's #deal is $5 off a Mad Men-inspired cardigan."" Include your website and/or a coupon code to drive people to your site. Users will click on ""#deal"" and your post will come up in their list, or Twitter aggregate sites, like CheapTweet, will pull all of the hashtag deals from the day from Twitter and list them on their site.
Follow trending topics, which are popular hashtags, on Twitter. When a topic relates to your industry, or you have something to say that correlates with the topic, use the hashtag along with a comment and your URL. Some websites have started blogging about current events so that they can effectively use the hashtag to bring Twitter users to their website.
Create a short and memorable company, event or website hashtag. Use it in your own posts, so your followers know to use it every time they read something on your site or buy a product. Search your hashtag daily and respond to people who have used it, in order to encourage good conversation, or redirection to a conversation on your site.

, Search on Twitter every day for mentions of your site or your hashtag, and respond to problems or conversations. Be gracious about criticism, because the best thing you can do is provide a rational, understanding and problem-solving approach.

, Be a guest blogger on someone else's website, and let them blog on your site. Working with other businesses or professionals who have a good Twitter following will get you more followers, who will then see your profile and visit your site.

, List a code that they can input into your site to get content. People will be encouraged to recommend, or retweet, this information, and you will quickly see how much traffic you are gaining from Twitter.

Collate classroom views (Homework (or netbooks or a computer lab)):


First...set up new Twitter account with name of topic or question

EG: Students discussing current economic climate might be: SaveOrSpend
Ask pupils to tweet @SaveOrSpend which they think is the wisest thing to do with your hard earned cash, or Government taxes
This allows you to study any topic that has an open question to ask

Then the Twitter account collates the classes tweets in a web page...

twitter.com/saveorspend (that's a dummy address so no need to URL it)




Instant collaborative web page with contributors' identities included

Find out where people are.,
Teach them to be 'short but sweet'.,
Take a Twitter poll.,
Word Morph


Student stuck trying to find a new or interesting word?,
Come together.,
Teach Point of View and Character Development


Based on a novel or short story...

After a study of point of view and character development
Students become a character and create a Twitter account ex: @janeeyre, @rochester
Students use their study of that character to create conversations around key events in the plot
Would be even more interesting to focus on events and situations that are omitted from the text, but referred to, so the students are creating their own fiction based on their knowledge of the writer, the time period, and the characters



,
GeoTweet


This follows in the footsteps of some of the other tips

Introduce your class to the features of Google Earth by asking your Twitter network for a small piece of location info.,
Study and learn Global Assembly


Ask your Twitter network to comment on local or national issues for a class or whole school assembly.,
Do some word play.,
Use the power of Twitter and communicate with experts.

,
Use a Twitter widget for instant webpage updates.

,
Monitor the learning process.,
Use it to demonstrate probability.,
Create 'twalter-egos'.",How to Use Twitter in the Classroom," After creating a bit of a network, send out a shout out asking for a variety of things. Some of them are:


Location (e.g. for Geography)
Temperature (e.g. for Science)
An interesting historical fact
Their opinion about something
Anything, really!

This makes learning based on up-to-date information and real people (with a real story behind it!)

;
,


Use TwitterFall first.

Type in a keyword (""communism"", ""appeasement"", ""poverty"" - whatever)
Then watch the results come pouring in using twitterfall!


Then use Twittermap

www.twittermap.com allows you to GeoTag users and their posts
You therefore get an idea of where certain topics are being discussed most...



,


Use www.historicaltweets.com

This gives some great ideas about how famous people might summarise their ideas / experiences as ""Tweets"" in 140 characters max!
Then...students do the same!

Produce a Tweet dialogue between two opposing characters (e.g. King Harold and William the Conqueror) about a key issue...
Summarise a topic / concept / viewpoint as a tweet; each student should be given a different one to focus on.





,


First...Choose your theme

Genre - Fairy Tale, Sports Story, Adventure etc.
Give it a standard story opener and tweet this to your network
Ask network to continue the story in tweets, collaborating with the previous tweets and following them via www.twitterfall.com or a #tag


Then...students follow via twitterfall, choose the best ones and edit them into a coherent story

Great for editing skills, story structure etc.
Where will your network take the story?



,,


Set up a new Twitter account for your class - you will possibly want to 'protect' your updates. Invite parents to 'follow' you, and they can see what the class are up to from any computer (home, work, internet cafe...) at any time of the day or night. They might even tweet back now and again!

,


Put up a tweet asking people to give you their location.
Class first estimate distance from school, then use an atlas to gauge distance.
Then using Google Earth - can place mark where they are and find out distances.
Retweet results!

Benefits: Gives class an immediate set of places and distances to research. They might be interested to find out where people are and who they are!



,


Give children individually the Twitter 140 characters rule - they have to write story introduction, character description or whole story.
Results can then be posted onto Twitter or via blogs
In groups tell children they are to play pass it on - but must do this in only Twitter 'speak' 140 characters.
They then add to it around the group and can be shared in same way!

, One place that does that is twtpoll.com


How do adult opinions differ from the views of the class?
Use a Twitter poll to collect and graph opinions about a controversial issue.

, Is the student's writing clique or lacking descriptive language?
Use Twitter to send out a word and have your network give the students synonym and other meanings, thereby testing the literacy strength of your PLN. Or have classrooms connect during writing workshops. Then have the students help each other create Wordle clouds of a word and the words that are synonyms, antonyms, and examples to foster stronger and more descriptive writing. The Wordle clouds become help posters during writing for the rest of the year.

,


Find someone in another class, school, country who is interested in the same topic you are. Following each other on Twitter, share information, resources and ideas.
Help each other find answers or even suggest questions

Example - Rain Forest

Primary class, primary teacher, class from special school, teacher (special), secondary class, secondary teacher and subject expert all linked via Twitter
Sharing resources/learning with others is easy and context specific
Primary/special pupils can tweet questions to secondary pupils who can either answer from prior knowledge or investigate. Subject expert able to make sure all is correct
Twitter quiz set by secondary pupils as plenary activity for special/primary pupils





,,
Challenge your class to find the teachers who have replied.
Try to gather some evidence that you have found them - name on football pitch, distinct shape of building - something to prove they have been found.
Reply with this info.
Use different Google Earth layers of information to help with the search.
Gives a great real purpose to the use of Google Earth



,
In the past, try commenting on questions, like ""What does WATER means to them?"" and ""What does a new term mean to you?""
With a global, if somewhat still limited, perspective we were able to talk about how world climate differences can influence such a commodity.
Ask you network to comment on the issue you are discussing and to ensure they provide where they are.

,


Post 8 letters and see how many words can be made from it (anagram)
Post a word. Have the students find its antonyms, homonyms, synonyms.
Use www.twtpoll.com to poll students about definitions.

,,,


While they work on assignments, stimulate your students to tweet and reply about:
Stuff they learn
Difficulties they face
Tips they want to share
Great resources they find
In this way, Twitter replaces the students logbook

, When learning about probability and the language of chance in mathematics, use your Twitter network to offer a real world response to your questions.


""What are the chances you will see a deer today?""
""What are the chances it will snow where you are?""
With a variety of people in different locations you will hopefully have a variety of different responses.
This has been used successfully for a few years now in my maths lessons, and the different language used in replies provides a great teaching opportunity. From ""50/50"" to ""Buckley's Mate"" !
Twitter replies could then be captured, added to a IWB notebook and placed on a probability scale or indeed a map of the origin, sparking further discussion about how this affects the probability of different events.

,


Try creating a fictional alter-ego in Twitter who would develop as a 'character' who had a backstory.
After this has been developed, they could be 'introduced' to classes, who could follow, and do activities based on past tweets.

References to other people (defined by the use of ""@"" followed by text)
Links to URLs you can visit (defined by the use of ""http://"" followed by text)
Hashtags you can explore and participate with (defined by the use of ""#"" followed by text)
Retweets of other people, passing along information (defined by the use of ""rt"", ""r/t/"", ""retweet"" or ""via"")Generosity is measured by just one thing. Your tendency to share good info and tweets with others by retweeting.
Velocity is measured by how much you contribute to Twitter. This is judged against a theoretical maximum of 1500 contributions in a week.Clout is considered special pull or influence. Twitalyzer's definition of clout is as follows:

, The general rule of thumb is to follow as many people as you have as followers. This will be hard if you are not very popular. If you only have about 9 followers, then you should try to keep the list of people you follow under 200, although 100 is preferred.

Follow the hashtags on events you plan to attend to see other users who plan on attending.",How to Network on Twitter," For most people, Twitter is a mix of professional interests and personal hobbies, but for others it is purely one or the other. As with all social media, you should be careful what you post, especially with photos, political beliefs, religious beliefs or potentially offensive material.;
, Create a profile that explains who you are, where you are, what you do and what interests or hobbies are. Try to make it a mix of personality and professionalism.


Upload a profile picture that also reflects a personality, but a professional demeanor. If you are networking for a personal creative business or blog, you may want to include your logo.
Set your account to ""Public"" instead of ""Private,"" if you want people to follow you more easily. If your account is set to be private, you must go through an approval process before they can see your tweets and full content.It could also mean that you would get less followers.

, Show your professional personality with links to articles, pictures of something relevant to your professional life or thoughts about life and work. Before you begin following too many people, you should expect people will take a look at your profile to see if they want to follow you.

, Have a goal of following 5 new people every week, so that your Twitter feed does not become overwhelming. These ways are commonly used to find people on Twitter:


If you have favorite blogs, add your favorite bloggers on Twitter. They will most likely be set up under the same name as their blog, which you can search for in the search field at the top of the page. Also, search their blogs for lists of people they recommend that you follow on Twitter. Many bloggers try to suggest their friends, colleagues or peers to their readers.
Go to a Twitter directory, like twellow.com or wefollow.com to search for people with similar interests. Try being as specific as possible in the beginning, and search by area, interests, age and more. Go to their account, if it is public, to see if you like what they are tweeting about.
Pay attention to the hashtag ""#FollowFriday,"" or ""#ff."" In January 2009, a blogger and Twitter user started this networking hashtag as a way to recommend your favorite Twitter users to your friends. On Fridays, see if people you follow post their recommendations, for example, ""You must check out @sanjuantopics, @creativesarah and @bridgetreads #followfriday.""

, You cannot expect to be the first to find an article, or even to state a topic the most eloquently. You can show who you are, and how discerning you are, by what you choose to retweet.

, Use the ""@username"" direct tweeting option to comment about someone's post or introduce people. Answer people who tweet directly to you, and thank people who are complimentary.


A big part of networking is speaking, and this is how you speak on Twitter. Start replying to friends' tweets to get the hang of it, and until you get the confidence to tweet directly to someone with a lot of followers.

, Also, don't be afraid to mention other Twitter accounts. Give a shout out to someone if you like what they are doing.

, After you have some followers, ask their advice or opinion on personal or professional topics. Try to avoid religious or political fervent posts, but don't be afraid to ask something that might get a few different opinions on a topic.

, On these platforms, you can have online conversations over 140 characters, which can help to encourage professional relationships. Do not try to sell yourself too strongly, just list your blog website in your profile and/or post your username occasionally.

, For many people, this means arranging to email or Skype with a user if you have similar professional interests. You may have the chance to arrange collaborative meetings, and Twitter can serve as an excellent icebreaker.

, Many professional events have their own hashtag, so click on the tag to see what other people are saying. Plan to meet people at the event so that you can network in person.

Twitter Karma A very useful tool.",How to Manage and Grow Your Twitter Account," What you might quickly find is the immense potential Twitter may have on an aspiring business. Twitter is first and foremost a social networking site but when used for ways of commerce, this is when Twitter's abundant usefulness and resources truly become apparent.At the beginning you start out as a fledgling tweeter as everyone else does, but quickly realize that you have the opportunity to become somebody important! But how??? How does one find their niche? That is entirely up to you! This brings me to the reason for this post. Twitter, if used correctly, can be a marketing tool of enormous potential that reaches thousands! The best part of all, it's free! If this is the primary reason for you joining Twitter then I have a few tools that have helped gather me more exposure (followers) much more quickly than traditional means. And when you have followers, you have exposure! This is what I've been trying to get at! Keep in mind that others have discovered this process long before you...so tact and imagination are the order of the day. Do NOT spam! Do NOT become intolerable to those around you! This may be the BEST resource you ever find in your quest for success, so treat it with kid gloves and look before you leap. The following sites are all free and designed to get you more followers (potentially more money) in a short amount of time.;
, The main, or Home Glide. This is where you will see posts from all of your ""friends"" or followers. Posts made by you are a different color, which allows you to see your posts quickly and easily. The @Mentions and Direct Messages can also be turned on or off in the Home Glide and are also a different color! When others reply specifically to your tweets or you reply to others, the tweets become ""threaded"", so when you read replies, they are attached to the message being replied to. No more confusion or searching for the original tweet! 'Sponsored Tweets' - as the name implies, this is where you view ads by other TweetGlide members, as well as your ads. This Glide can be turned off, but can not be moved from the second column as long as it's turned on. Mentions - an easy way to view any mentions of you. Now you know quickly when people are replying to your tweets, or mention you in other tweets. Direct Messages - view all messages sent to you, or all messages you have sent to others!

, Unlike some of the other schemes out there that require you to follow a hundred people before they place you on the list, FastFollowers uses a fair credit system. When you follow people you earn credits from them, and vice versa when they follow you. You can decide how many credits you want to offer per follow, and when you run out you remain on the list so people can still follow you if they like. You can also bulk-purchase credits if you'd prefer to do less following yourself, and just want to grow your own followers.

, This is achieved by following accounts, a part of which must reciprocate by following you. The percentage of accounts which follow you in reply can vary greatly from 1% to 30%. You need the program if you've just started to post on Twitter and you only have a few followers.

, A great site for gaining followers that offers free and paid services. Free service enables you to follow all the people on the ""twitter train"". People that pay to be VIPs get to be first on train and get to be on it more often, therefore gaining more followers. A very effective way to start.

, Each Opportunity listing contains a description of the desired TWEET and the compensation to be paid by the Advertiser.

, A fun site that allows you to ask and answer questions on twitter. The principle behind this is, as more people ask or answer questions more people become involved. Yours and their answers are tweeted and more followers view them and become interested and involved. Here's a link to a video that explains the process firsthand.

, Basically, it’s a Flash application that fetches your friends and followers from Twitter when you click the “Whack!” button, then displays them for you, letting you quickly paginate through them. By default, the list contains all your friends and followers and is sorted by last update, showing those who most recently updated first. You can sort the list alphabetically either ascending or descending by Twitter ID. You can filter the list in several ways: only friends or only followers, all friends or all followers, and mutual friends. These are but a few of the better ways to utilize the full potential of Twitter. Hope this helps get you off the ground and tweeting with the best of 'em!

Learn more about your followers.,

Engage in specific “follow trains.” This is one of the most effective ways to increase your followers quickly.,
Be active with your account.",How to Measure Twitter Impressions," You can actually view all of your marketing information for Twitter right from Twitter analytics, so sign in as you normally would.;
, Once you log in, you will be on your Twitter stream. In the top right corner of the window is your Twitter icon. It will be in between the “Search Twitter” field and the “Tweet” button. Click it to expand several options to choose from and then select “Analytics.”

, Take a moment to search through the information on the Analytics landing page. At the top of the page you will find your 28-day activity summary, and under that you will find monthly summaries.


Click on the 'Bar diagram'.







, There are several different important terms used throughout Twitter Analytics that it are important to understand. They include:



Tweets—This is pretty straightforward. This number represents how many actual tweets you’ve sent out, and this includes retweets. Fun fact: You are limited to 1,000 tweets per day.

Tweet Impressions—Every time one of your tweets is scrolled over by someone, you gain an impression. If someone retweets you, then all their followers will count as an impression each.

Profile Visits—This is how many people actually clicked on your name and viewed your profile page.

Mentions—This is how many times another user tweeted a tweet with your username in it (@yourusername).

Followers—This is how many followers you gained minus a number of followers you lost in a given time period.

, You can get even more information from Twitter analytics about the effectiveness of your account. Move from the Analytics home page to the Tweets page by clicking “Tweets” at the top.



Engagements—Engagements occur anytime somebody does something with your tweet. Either they clicked on a hashtag you used, they favorited your tweet, or they retweeted your tweet. This means your tweet caught their eye and they interacted with it in some way.

Engagement Rate—This is the percentage of people that interacted with your tweet (engaged it) as compared to all of the people that could have seen it. (impressions)
You can scroll through all your tweets and see what kinds of messaging is catching your audience’s attention. You can base future tweets on this information and hopefully become more popular.

, If you’re going to make better use of Twitter in any serious way, learning about your followers can be key when deciding what content to put out there yourself. The fastest way to get more impressions isn’t getting more followers yourself, it’s getting more people that already follow you to retweet your tweets to their followers. Click the “Followers” link on the Analytics page.


You can view your audience’s top interest, which is essential for building a comprehensive Twitter strategy.
Click on “Demographics” and you will see expanded Demographic information. Here you can see the Gender breakdown of your audience, what languages they speak, and what countries they are from.
Click on “Lifestyle” and you will see expanded information about your audience’s interests and what TV genres they enjoy watching.
Click on “Mobile Footprint” and you will see expanded information about the mobile carriers that your audience uses while on Twitter.

, Now that you’ve got a vast wealth of knowledge about your followers, you should be able to create content that is more targeted toward that specific audience. For example:


You find out that your audience is mostly male and into watching sports, but you’re into news and politics. You could use analogies and references to football, for instance, and merge that into your Tweets to really grab the attention of the people to increase your engagement rate.
You find out that your audience loves comedy; you could find quotes from famous stand-up comedians to drive home your point.
Small changes like these could make a huge difference in garnering attention for you.

, A “follow train” is essentially when a group of people decides to retweet a specific tweet from a popular user, and the goal is to have everybody follow each other.


Be sure that you engage only in a follow train that suits your needs. To use the political example, you’re not going to want to get into a general follow train where you’re going to pick up a bunch of followers that will have no interest in your political messaging.
Be sure to actually follow everybody because if people notice you’re not being mutual, they’re going to unfollow you and you will have wasted your time.
This tool can be great if you find people of like mind on a specific issue or people that are among your general audience.

, Don’t be afraid to Tweet. People aren’t going to unfollow you if you Tweet several times throughout the day.


Remember that your followers followed you for a reason and that is likely to see more content from you.
Make sure to retweet things that you find amusing or things that you agree with. You can capitalize on the popularity of someone else’s tweet by retweeting. You will very likely get more profile views and hopefully more followers from this.

Make sure your DM doesn't sound like spam.

,
Avoid making pitches to people via DM that are impersonal.,
Do not use services that allow you to auto DM.,
If you want to use auto DMs, wait to be followed instead of going out and getting lots of followers.",How to Keep Your Followers on Twitter," Most people use Twitter as a personal outlet to talk about interesting events and thoughts in their lives, but if you are a professional or if you have specific hobby, you should include that information in your Twitter bio. Subscribers will then know of your passion and that you will sometimes post about it. They can be interested in these things as well. Also, if you post in your summary for About You that you will follow someone back, be sure to do so and this could get you more followers by the minute.

, Keep your follow list small enough that you can interact with a large percentage of them. Offer to help your followers who need help that you can provide.

, However, remember that Twitter is your personal outlet and that you are free to express your thoughts. If someone vehemently opposes your positions and is so unnerved that they can't remain subscribed to you, it's probably for the best. Strike a balance between staying true to what you believe in and not inflaming your audience.


That said, don't post tweets that are senseless and offensive. For example, being racist or insulting people are unnecessary behaviors that could land you in a lot of trouble.
Avoid using slurs and inflammatory types of language that can be offensive.

, Remember that every time you reply to someone, your tweet is sent to your subscribers and visible to them. If you have many conversations, your subscribers' feeds will be littered with your tweets that have nothing to do with them. If you need to communicate with an individual, privately direct message them instead.


Do not engage trolls who @ reply to you in order to get a rise out of you. It's not worth your time or effort.

, They also may think that your account has been hacked or is a robot and consequently, unfollow you.

, People like consistency and followed you for a reason. If you started your Twitter as a personal outlet but later switched to only providing advice on public speaking, be prepared to lose subscribers who aren't interested in your new topic.

, Ask yourself the following questions:
Is this DM worth $0.10 for some one to receive if they have the option of getting their DMs sent to them via text message? If no, don't send the DM.
Do I know this person well enough that I feel like they will respond or click through on the links? If no, don't send the DM.
Am I popular enough that I can send this message and get away with that consequence free? If no, don't send the DM.
Am I sending this past some one's bedtime where a text message alert may wake them up? If yes, don't send the DM as Twitter can break those messages up in to two parts and really annoy them.;
,, If your pitch is impersonal and not specifically for the respondent, send it as a tweet.

, Auto DMs frequently cost you followers.

, Make sure that your page says that you send out DMs to people. It makes it more opt in than and consumer friendly."

, If you think that life online life is really a representative of clear-cut human one-to-one relations that validate your worth, this is reality check time. It's a messaging service. It is not a measure of your personal worth, goodness, or ability to wow a crowd. It is simply a communications tool that sometimes causes people to think more about life online than life for real.

, They're still following you, they haven't checked out. Some will eventually, but others won't. It's not about you; it's about them whenever this happens.

, What would compel you to block someone (besides the spam and porn follows)? Perhaps if you think about how hard it can be to make a block decision if you are hamstrung by having to worry about how people might react, then you would feel constricted and not be able to manage your online account as effectively as you'd like to. It's a tool for organizing as much as for stopping some people from adding you and such; try to see it more that way rather than as anything personal.

, You won't ever know why the person blocked you unless they're someone you know personally and can ask by other means. And even if you could find out, why care so much? There are so many possible reasons and a major one happens to be there that people get moody and make rash decisions and press buttons in those rash moments. That's not admirable... Or, it could be they just felt like cleaning out most of their buddies/friends; this has become more common in recent times and it's not directed personally at anyone because it's directed at everyone. They might have made a mistake and blocked you when they meant to block someone else. There are many reasons. But life is too short and too important for you to sit around feeling blue about something as fickle as the vagaries of behavior online.

, Put on your walking shoes. Go outside and get lots of fresh air. Look at the real birds in the trees instead of the computer screen. Work out that you're still alive, happy, and very much valued by those in the living community around you. More power to you!

, That is, anyone should be able to look at your tweets, regardless of whether they have been approved to follow you. If your tweets are protected, no one except your approved followers can see your tweet, even if they have been mentioned.

, It's a good idea to find a celeb who usually tweets a lot -- they are more likely to care about who tweets @ them. For example, search for Tom Mcfly, who is one of the singers in the hot British band 'Mcfly'.

, To reply to one, mouse over the update and click on the arrow. It will say: ""@tommcfly"". That is okay.

, Send your message. Tweet a question or interesting/provocative statement to encourage a response. If you just compliment the celebrity or express your love for them, they'll probably silently appreciate your compliment but not feel the need to respond. You want to give the celebrity some concrete material to respond to.


Try to tweet at celebrities when they have just tweeted. This way you know they are online and your tweet will be at the top of their list.

, Celebrities wouldn't want to reply to something boring. Adding pictures to your tweets makes it more interesting and if it is something funny or relevant to them, then they might notice it. If you tweet things like ""I'm your biggest fan!"", then they would most likely not reply to you because they get these kind of tweets all the time. Be unique in your approach and think of things to tweet that no one else tweets.

, Don't send the same message a billion times in 5 minutes, or desperately reply to every tweet a celebrity posts. Remember: quality, not quantity, will get you noticed. A bunch of inane, vapid tweets will just be annoying and possibly get you blocked.

, They'll increase visibility for your tweets, especially if you tweet about a trending topic. If you have a good story or picture with your tweet, that's even better -- it's more likely that you'll be retweeted and favorited. If a celebrity uses a hashtag, think of how that hashtag can also apply in your life and use it too. Anytime a celebrity is trying to promote a hashtag, indulge them and join in the fun!

, Everyone appreciates their message spreading across the Twitter-sphere, and there's no better way to show your appreciation for a good tweet than to retweet it in all its glory.

If nothing comes up, try looking on their website or portfolio for their Twitter Follow link.


If you see a blue icon with a white check mark next to a Twitter account, that means that Twitter has taken steps to verify the identity of that account. A verified account means that the celebrity in question owns that Twitter account.
Be wary of unverified Twitter accounts. It's easy to find pictures of a celebrity on the Internet to use as the avatar. Fans and other people may try to impersonate the celebrity for attention or for malicious spamming.;
, The more active they are on Twitter and the more personal their tweets are, the better your chances of getting them to engage with you. After considering the following questions, if it doesn't seem like your celebrity does much personal engagement on Twitter, you may want to consider moving on to another favorite celebrity.


How frequent are their tweets?
Do they frequently tweet themselves, or hire someone else to tweet on their behalf?
Do they post pictures and links in addition to text tweets, or do they do the bare minimum?
Do they post their personal thoughts, or just use their Twitter as a way to promote their business commercially?
Have they ever sent an @message to one of their fans and engaged in a conversation with them?
For example, Christina Perri not only tweets multiple times a day, but also with photos and hashtags, suggesting that she is an experienced Twitter user. Her tweets are personal enough that they probably come straight from her. Your chances of getting her to follow you are decent if you make a strong favorable impression on her, but notice how her (public) interactions with fans on Twitter are low.

, Do you like their music or sports performance? Make sure to stay on top of their latest productions and accomplishments by reading news sites that would feature your celebrity, such as TMZ, Perez Hilton, Yahoo! News, E! Online, and others. Subscribing to Google News alerts for emails about articles that mention your celebrity is also a good idea.


Make a note of what organizations and charities the celebrity is involved with. Follow them on Twitter and stay on top of their work as well. If it accords with your personal beliefs, you may even make a donation to that charity and let the celebrity know.

, Use hashtags that they use and are trying to promote. Retweet their tweets to your followers, especially when they are asking fans to check something out or are promoting another entity. Reply to their tweets with your reactions and thoughts. This will flood their Twitter streams with comments from you, making them more familiar and comfortable with you. As a result, they may start following you.


Don't be annoying. Remember that they are human beings, and don't like to be spammed or to receive the similar overexcited messages repeatedly. Make sure each interaction you make with them is meaningful.
Time your engagements well. Responding to every single one of their tweets comes off as desperate and fake. Only respond when you have something interesting to say or when you really want to get their tweet out to others. Engaging with them more than twice a day borders on excessive.

, When your celebrity accomplishes something or does something praiseworthy, tweet at them to congratulate them and express your appreciation for the work that they do.


Make sure to time it appropriately—hence the importance on staying up-to-date about the latest news surrounding your celebrity. They're human beings too; they would appreciate a compliment on their new album or hairstyle just as much as the rest of us would.
Ideally, you want to produce an emotional reaction from the celebrity to your tweet. If you liked their new dress, say why or talk about an outfit it inspired you to wear. Feel free to include photos! If you enjoyed their entire new album, say that it's been playing on repeat for the past 13 hours.
Make sure what you're saying is true: celebrities can tell when someone is being over-the-top and brown-nosing for attention rather than expressing genuine appreciation.

, If you can get a laugh out of somebody, they like you better already and are almost certain to reply.

, Don't force it, but some of the tweets you make to the celebrity will naturally lend themselves to a further question, which will encourage the celebrity to reply back to you. For example, you can ask when their next tour is coming up, or what their favorite piece in their new fashion collection is.


Make sure your question doesn't require a lengthy response, as Twitter only allows 140 characters per response. For example, a question about the source of inspiration for a song would be a better choice for an email or direct message on Twitter than a tweet.

, Try tweeting to your followers about the celebrity. Be sure to tag them at the beginning or end, and only say nice things. Celebs don't want to see their name attached to a hate message.


You can also tweet out to your followers to follow the celebrity. For example, you could say: ""@celebrity is only 10 followers away from getting to 12K! Hit that follow button, sweethearts!"" Celebs love it when their fans help them gain more followers. This usually works, and it's amazing because the celeb will have more followers, and they may even tweet you thanks (or follow you).

, Thank them for their response to your question, comment on it, and continue the conversation for as long as it is natural. Keep in mind that it is unlikely they will tweet at you twice, so you might want to wrap it up quickly.


Finish off with a note that you'd appreciate it if they would follow you on Twitter, as you are a big fan of their work. Because you've already expressed your admiration for them and had a personal interaction with you, they're much more likely to oblige to your request.
Don't pressure, bribe, or threaten celebrities to follow you. You want them to follow you because they appreciate you as a fan. You want them to want to follow you—not for some other external reason.

Navigate to https://twitter.com/ and sign-in to your account.,
Know the person's name or username.,
Use the search bar.,
Enter their username into the URL bar.,
Find a celebrity.",How to Find People on Twitter1," If you have not already created an account, read our great article about how to join Twitter.;
, Twitter offers two different identifiers for an account -- usernames and real names. Usernames are marked by the '@' symbol. Real names are the real name of the person.


If the person you are trying to find has a common name, it will be more efficient to know their username. Usernames are unique to each user while real names are not.

, Enter the username or real name of the person you wish to follow via the Twitter search bar. The search bar should be located in the upper right corner of the window, to the left of your profile picture. Enter a name or username, then click the magnifying glass to search. You will see 6 different options for specifying search results.



Top: This will include a combination of the most popular accounts, tweets, photos, and videos that include your search term.

Live: This shows a livestream of tweets with your search term. For example, if you searched ""Bill Clinton,"" it will show the most recent tweets, photos, or videos about Bill Clinton.

Accounts: Shows a list of accounts with your search term as the real name. The most popular accounts will be ordered first. If you are searching for a celebrity, like Hugh Jackman, the first account will likely be the actual account. However, if you are searching for a friend named John Smith, you may need to browse through the accounts to find the right John Smith. This is when you should search using the @username, instead.

Photos: Shows a list of photos related to your search term.

Videos: Shows a list of videos related to your search term.

More Options: Lets you narrow your search by location or from people you follow.

, If you know the person's username, this is the most efficient way to get to their Twitter page. Add ""/username"" without the quotes (following www.twitter.com) to be directed to the user's feed. For example, if you want to go to Bill Clinton's page, add his username (@billclinton) to twitter.com. The URL should look like this: https://twitter.com/billclinton.

, Celebrities do not always use their real name on Twitter. Occasionally, their real name will be already used. In this case, it may be best to search for them by their username. Look around the web for the correct username.


The verified account will also have a checkmark next to it.

Involve yourself in discussions.",How to Fundraise on Twitter," Generally speaking before you even consider fundraising you’re already going to have a cause, but you should ask yourself if your cause or campaign will be able to generate large public interest. You must have a cause that you believe people will want to raise funds for. Some examples include:


A non-profit organization such as a cultural exchange program, food drive, or charity.
A political campaign.
A legal defense fund.
Local projects for youth such as a sports league.;
, It is important that you utilize every bit of space on your profile properly to market yourself. You need to make sure that people will understand who you are and what your cause is or what you’re trying to accomplish. A flashy banner or slogan and a great username is needed to catch more potential followers.


You can change your username on Twitter without losing your followers through the Settings. Make sure you create a username that refers somehow to your fundraising campaign. Let’s say you’ve chosen to fundraise for ABC Student Exchange Program. An effective Twitter username would be something like @abcexchangefund.
Utilize your bio effectively. When another user clicks on your account, this is the second thing they’re going to read, after your username. Explain your cause in as few words as possible to quickly garner the interest. Your Twitter bio is limited to 160 characters, so you really want to make the most of them. You want to inform users about who you are, what you’re all about, and any exciting information. ABC Student Exchange Program’s Twitter bio could be, “Student Exchange | Changing Lives | Fundraiser | 50 Years of Exchanges | Over 12 Countries | Experience Culture.”

, To be able to effectively fundraise, you’re going to need to get your tweets in front of as many users as possible. This means you need to generate followers. Some strategies include:


Following people; simply following other people often get you a follow back. Try to follow the right people, people who you think might be willing to help generate funds for your cause or campaign.
Try to make sure that you’re not following or getting followed by bots that are a waste of your time. It isn’t the amount of followers you have, but rather the amount of quality followers that you have.
Participate in conversations using popular hashtags that are relevant to your cause. The more participation you’re involved in, the more people will see your user name and will click on your profile.

, You will need a website so that you can draw traffic from Twitter to your website and hopefully to a donation. Perform an internet search to create a website. Several free examples include:


websitebuilder.com
wix.com
sitebuilder.com
weebly.com

, When you create a website from the list above you will be given a web address such as “yoursitename.wix.com.” While this sort of address gets the job done, it doesn’t look as professional as having your own domain. You might instead want to buy “yoursitename.com / yoursitename.org.” A few examples of domain registrars (companies you can buy your web address from) are:


iwantmyname.com
godaddy.com
register.hostgator.com

, The Top Level Domain is what comes at the end of your website address. The most common are .com, .net, and .org. A list of Top Level Domains are tightly regulated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.In recent years many more Top Level Domains have been opened up for registration. A good Top Level Domain for ABC Student Exchange Program would could be abc.exchange. Some other good ideas for a fundraiser include:


.fund
.charity
.care
.community
.gives
.foundation

, Go to PayPal.com and create an account designated for your fundraising campaign. Make sure that the email you provide also has a name that is relevant to the campaign, like abcexchange@gmail.com, so that those wishing to donate can easily remember the name. This way they can share it with friends, colleagues and family members. Word of mouth is a powerful thing.

, In a world of 140 character text mini-blogs, a well-placed infographic related to your cause catches a lot of attention. Here is a list of sites that can help you with this task:


canva.com
infogr.am
piktochart.com

, After generating sufficient followers that will hopefully spread your message, you need to come up with a catchy hashtag. Make sure that it is relevant to your cause.

, Send out tweets using your graphics and hashtags. You likely are not going to be able to tweet “too much.” In fact most people do not tweet enough because they fear being a nuisance, especially when they’re asking people to donate. It is important that you have a variety of donation asks and infographics continuing throughout the day. Keep in mind that if you represent a non-profit organization, people are going to be willing to tolerate a lot more from you. It is better to over-tweet than to be underexposed due to a lack of presence., When people start using your hashtag you should involve yourself in conversations to keep the trend going. Post your infographics and stories. Talk about why people should support the campaign and why it is important.

Dedicate specific times each day to read your Twitter feed and engage with your network (followers, following, lists).

,

, Twitter is where the original hashtag was born. Most of the tweets published today use one or more hashtags. You can search hashtags relevant to your business in Twitter’s search menu at the top. From there, you can find relevant content to share as well as find others who are in your industry. Customers can also use hashtags to tweet to or about your business. This is a great way to interact with your customers., Many people are facing the pain points that your product solves. You can search Twitter for people who are tweeting about those problems. You can then tweet back at them to tell them about your product. For example, if you are an insurance company, search the phrase ‘insurance rates’ to find people who are looking for a better deal., As a successful business, you probably know who your competitors are. In order to reach more of your customer base, go to your competitors’ Twitter accounts and begin following people who are following them. Some of those people will begin following your company too. They will then be able to see your company’s tweets. If anything, they will be excited to see another company in the same industry took the time to follow them."

, Mark key words in each tweet with a hashtag to connect them to related tweets. This will help you join the larger conversation on Twitter. Also, since hashtags are searchable, this will increase the outreach of your tweets.

, Do not post automated tweets more than once or twice a day, as this can quickly become annoying and turn your followers away. Limit self-promoting tweets, and don't post anything that doesn't have some kind of relevance or value. Remember that your followers follow you for a specific reason, and if you overstep those boundaries, you risk losing followers - and potentially losing customers.

Consider adding the following details to your account:A brief description of you, your content, and your mission.
A link to your website (if applicable).
Your general location (e.g., your country).
You can add this information in by going to your profile, clicking the gear icon, and clicking Profile.;
, Uploading and re-pinning focused content will show your followers that they can count on consistent presentation from you; with time, you can use this consistency to become a valuable resource to followers.


For example, if you're interested in nature, focus on nature-based content and avoid off-topic posts.
You can always create a secondary board (perhaps even a private one) for content that you want to pin for yourself.

, Around 80 percent of posts on Pinterest are re-pins. To help your account stand out, upload some of your own content that fits your theme.This doesn't mean you can't re-pin--in fact, re-pinning is a vital part of your growth strategy--but avoid exclusively re-pinning items and try uploading some of your own.
Pinterest users tend to enjoy infographics. If creating and uploading infographics fits your content theme, doing so is worth your while.
Try to keep the content you post largely specific to Pinterest. Posting the same exact content across all of your social media platforms will actually cut down on overall follower engagement.

, Adding a title, a description, and tagging other people you follow will both make the posts more appealing to your followers and increase the number of people who can search for your posts.Using hashtags in the description box that relate to your posts' content will increase the number of search queries that match to the posts.

, People will often leave comments on your posts; replying to these comments or addressing them in subsequent posts will help your followers feel heard, which will both retain followers and perpetuate your reputation as a positive creator.


You should also incorporate follower feedback for your content.

, Consistency is one of the most important aspects of any social media campaign. If your followers can rely on you to post content at regular intervals, you will eventually be able to create a demand for your content, thereby retaining followers and enticing non-followers.


Try to communicate your posting schedule to your followers so that they know what to expect.

, While plenty of people actively use Pinterest, expanding your reach to cater to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram users will greatly increase the number of people who can view your content.


You can link your various social media accounts to your Pinterest page from the Settings page.
Instead of promoting your entire profile on social media, you can promote a specific board to your followers so as not to inundate them with too much content.

, Tagging them, using hashtags to reference their content, and leaving comments on their content will draw their attention to you, meaning that they'll likely check out your account. You should also follow as many accounts as possible, since Pinterest users will often follow you back.


You should especially do this with other popular or verified accounts.
Consider following these users' specific boards so you don't miss their content when they post it.

, In addition to making sure that you're consistent, actively using Pinterest every day is a good way to ensure that you don't miss content relevant to your brand.Being on Pinterest throughout the day is also a good way to respond to followers quickly while their comments are still fresh.

Click on the three grey dots on the bottom-right corner of the tweet you would like to delete.,
Click on ""Delete Tweet"".",How to Delete a Retweet3," One way a tweet that somebody else has written may end up on your profile is if you manually re-post their tweets. This happens when you copy and paste a tweet from another user into a tweet of your own and then post the tweet. These are technically not retweets and the process of removing them is the same as it would be for a regular tweet, so what follows is an explanation of how to delete tweets from your Twitter profile.

, The way you find your profile depends on whether you're using Twitter on your computer or on your phone:


On the mobile app, do this by tapping the avatar at the bottom-right corner of your screen that says ""Me"".
On a web browser, click on the picture of your avatar at the top-right corner of your screen. Click on the name of your Twitter handle as it appears in the drop down menu.

, Scroll through your profile to see the full history of your tweets, until you come across the tweet you would like to delete.


If you remember what the tweet said, you can type keywords from the tweet into the search bar at the top-right corner of your screen to search for a specific tweet (although this method will give you results from other users, too).

, A list of options will appear.

, The tweet will be removed from your profile!

Tap or click on ""Turn off Retweets"".",How to Delete a Retweet4," Occasionally, somebody you don't follow will tweet something, which will then be retweeted by somebody you do follow. You can recognize those by the gray ""retweeted"" just above the tweet, along with a green retweet icon.

, Click or tap on the name of the user as it appears above the retweet.

, The button is just to the left of the blue ""Following"" button. Tap or click on the cog to see a drop-down menu of options.

, This will prevent you from seeing any future retweets that the user makes. You cannot delete retweets from others from your timeline, so your only recourse, should it become a problem, is to selectively turn off retweets from specific users. Also, there is no method for bulk blocking of retweets. You have to deal with each user individually. To reduce the clutter, visit the home page of the users that you follow.


You will still see the user's original tweets.
Note that this is not retroactive: all previous retweets will remain on your timeline."

You cannot use the Twitter app, and you can't use the mobile version of the site either. This means you'll need to request the desktop version of the site when you open your account settings in your mobile browser., When you load this page, you'll be informed that the page doesn't exist. This is normal. You can ignore this message as the page will load properly when you switch to the desktop version.

, The process for this varies depending on the browser you're using:


Chrome - Tap the ⋮ button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
Safari - Tap the Share button, which looks like a box with an arrow coming out of the top. On an iPhone, you'll find this at the bottom of the screen. On an iPad, you'll find it at the top next to the address bar.

, This will reload twitter.com/settings/account so that it displays as if you were on a desktop computer.


In Safari, scroll through the second row of options in the Share menu to find ""Request Desktop Site.""

, The address you entered will take you directly to your account settings. If you aren't logged into Twitter yet, you'll be prompted to do so.

, You'll find this at the very bottom of your Twitter account settings menu.

, Twitter will keep your account data stored for 30 days, then will permanently delete your account. You can reactivate your account by logging in anytime before the 30 days are up.

, This button will not appear until you've been on the page for a few moments.

, As a final precaution, you'll be asked to enter your Twitter password to confirm that you want to deactivate your account. Tap the ""Deactivate account"" button after entering your password.

, Your account will be removed from Twitter after a few minutes, but some information may still be visible for a few days.

, Once you deactivate your account, Twitter will store your account data for 30 days. After 30 days passes, your data is permanently deleted and you will not be able to reactivate your account no matter what.Thus, if you have second thoughts about deactivating your account, you'll need to make a decision before the 30 day waiting period is done or you'll have to sign up for an entirely new account.


If you miss the 30 day window, see our article on making a Twitter account to create a brand-new one.

, All you need to do to reactivate your old account is simply sign in with the username and password associated with that account. Once you do this, you'll be brought to the Twitter home page once again.

, As soon as your account is reactivated, you'll be able to use it to read and write tweets just like before. However, it may take a few minutes for certain account content (like old tweets, followers, and more) to be restored. Be patient — this should happen automatically.

, In the rare event that you are unable to reactivate your account, don't hesitate to contact Twitter via the official Twitter help site at support.twitter.com.Here, you'll find forms for reporting all sorts of technical issues — for reactivation problems, you'll want to click the ""Account restoration"" option.Some users occasionally report problems with the reactivation process not working on mobile devices. If this happens to you, you may want to try again on a computer or via the Twitter app."

Create a brand consistent profile.,
Start following.,
Communicate!,

Find your customers.,
Etiquette.",How to Create a Company Twitter Profile3," Your Twitter profile is effectively an extension of your brand. When setting up your profile, you must ensure it’s consistent with your company branding and brand guidelines. Make sure that the branding across all social media platforms is consistent. Your branding should be instantly recognisable to new visitors.


Choose a a Twitter handle that reflects your company name
Choose a relevant and representative image

, Make sure you follow relevant people and businesses. Consider starting by following - Trade bodies/organisations, Business partners, Your own clients, Future customers, Your direct competition and Your email address book (you can grant Twitter access to your email address book)

, That’s what Twitter is all about. Generally speaking you can break down Tweet content/Tweet types into the following:


Tweet – Something you write (in a 140 characters or less) and which you post to all your followers
Hashtag – Hashtags are searchable on Twitter (and now Facebook), if you use the #marketing within your Tweet somewhere, everyone who performs a search for #marketing on Twitter will likely come across your Tweet.
Retweet (RT) – Someone else’s Tweet that is of interest and you choose to share with your followers.
Reply – Start of a conversation – you reply to a specific Tweet and the string of the conversation is then visible on your timeline
Mention – A post containing the Twitter handle of another user: eg, @caburnhope_mktg great new website by the way!
Direct Message (DM) – A message you send to a specific user (they must follow you to receive the message) which is private and only seen by them.

, Twitter is a useful way of driving traffic to specific pages on your company website, creating appealing content is essential. Content can be in the form of news items, new product announcements, offers, blogs, brochures, opinion pieces, photos, videos etc.

, Maximise the opportunities that other users have of finding your Twitter account.


Use ‘Twitter follow’ badges on your website
Include your live Twitter feed on your website
Some other social media sites will offer the opportunity to include a link to your Twitter stream (Facebook for example)
Link posts from other social media platforms to your Twitter account
Use share buttons on your website making it easy for them to share your content
Add social media icons to your company email signature

, You can use Hashtags # or Search other user’s lists can to find other users/potential customers who may be useful to your business.

, Most importantly every social media platform has an etiquette that you should follow. Be mindful that everything you post on Twitter is in the public domain; each Tweet needs to be professional.

Follow the Tumblr user.,
Wait two weeks.To prevent trolling and spamming, Tumblr requires users to subscribe to a blog for two weeks before they can leave comments.,
Navigate to the blog post.,
Click on the Reply icon.,
Type your comment.,
Submit your comment.",How to Comment on Tumblr2," Navigate to the Tumblr blog you're interested in commenting on and click on the ""Follow"" button in the upper right corner.


You must create and sign into your Tumblr account before you can leave comments.
Note that you are unable to comment on your own blog posts. This feature only works if you wish to comment on others' posts, and if the blog you wish to comment has the feature enabled. Unfortunately, there is no way to know if the feature is enabled or disabled until you go through the process.

,


There is one exception to the rule, however. If the Tumblr user you start following decides to follow you back and has the appropriate setting enabled, you can leave a comment for that user before the two-week period ends.

, Go to the Tumblr blog you started following and find the blog post you wish to comment on.

, When available, the Reply icon should be located near the top of the post. It should look like a speech bubble and be positioned next to the Reblog (rotating arrows) icon.


Note that some blogs may not have comments enabled. In fact, replies are disabled by default; users need to specifically enable them in their settings before they can use this feature. For that reason, it is possible that the reply icon will be unavailable.
Some blogs may use text action buttons instead of icon buttons. In this case, look for the word ""reply"" near the top of the blog post.

, Click in the text box and type your comment. Note that you are limited to text replies, and your reply can only be 250 characters long., When you're satisfied with your comment, hit the ""Reply"" button beneath the text box to submit it.


Once you submit your comment, Tumblr will notify the user and add it to the list of notes attached to that post.
Understand that the user will be unable to directly respond to your comment on the blog post page. Instead, he or she will need to reblog your comment and add the appropriate reply in the comment field of the post box before publishing it.

Alternatively, he or she may copy the text of the reply and paste it into a new quote-style post, attributing your username as the source. The user's reply to your original comment can be typed into the same text box beneath your quoted remarks.



"
"
Navigate to the blog.,
Click on the Ask or Fan Mail icon.,
Type your comment.,
Submit your comment.",How to Comment on Tumblr3," Log into Tumblr and navigate to the specific blog you wish to comment to privately.


If you are currently logged out of Tumblr or do not have an account, you might be able to use this feature as long as the user allows anonymous questions. This method is more likely to work if you create and log into your Tumblr account first, though.
As with the public reply feature, private comments only work if the user enables them on his or her blog.

, If the Tumblr user has either of these features enabled on his or her blog, you should see the relevant icon in the upper right corner of the page. The Fan Mail icon looks like a small envelop, while the Ask icon is merely a small button labeled “Ask me.” Click on either icon to be redirected to the related page.


Both features are very similar to one another, but fan mail has a slightly larger character limit, cannot be posted anonymously, and remains private. Questions, on the other hand, can be directed to the Tumblr user anonymously or with your Tumblr username attached, and the question can be made public if the receiver chooses to answer it publicly.

, Click your cursor in the text box, if necessary, and begin typing your message.


You may also be able to customize your note by choosing different background ""paper"" and a different font from several pre-selected options.

, When you're satisfied with the comment you wrote, click on the “Send” button to privately submit it to the user who runs the associated Tumblr blog.


The Tumblr user you send a comment to should be able to reply back to you privately regardless of whether you submitted it as fan mail or as a question.

Don't take it personally.,
Consider the reasons why people tend to unfollow.,
Concentrate on the quality of the experience rather than on aiming for the huge numbers.,
Check your new follows.,
Enjoy Twitter.",How to Cope With Unfollows on Twitter," This is rule number one, no matter what. Twitter is a social networking site, not a family get-together or a competition. People come and go as easily as visitors to a fun fair. It's not personal, it does happen, and will continue to happen. Be realistic and relaxed about it.;
, It can help your understanding about the site's ebb and flow mentality by understanding the wide range of possible reasons for unfollows. Some of the reasons include:


Disinterest in the topics and information that you're tweeting.
Feeling overwhelmed by too many tweets from you, or in general (known as over-tweeting).
Lack of a genuine follow from them in the first place; they hooked you and then they disappear, hoping you won't notice.
You might have offended someone unintentionally, such as by tweeting a saying from someone that follower detests, or by tweeting to another follower that the un-follower doesn't like; it can be as petty as that, so all the more reason not to take it personally
They discover that they don't fancy your perspective, your politics, your religion, your ideas about the world; welcome to difference and the inability of some people to cope with that. It's still them and not you! It's just a bad fit.
You might be using too much of another language - although your proficiency in Spanish and Russian might thrill you and draw in some new followers, it can equally confuse and lose other followers. But don't let that constrain what makes tweeting fun for you!
You took a long break from updating. Well, really, whose fault is that when other followers' interest in you wanes?! Some people actively remove inactive tweeters.
Some people find that over time, the initial thrill of thousands of followers wears off and they do a cull to keep only those followers they feel most attached to. If that doesn't include you, it's not to be worried about. It is just how each follower's focus on the site evolves. After all, we can really only follow a ""tribe"" of around 150 people before it gets too hard to keep up.
Some people follow to get theme tweets (for example, about current news, the environment, a political event, etc.), whilst others are perfectly happy with an ever-changing eclectic mix. You can't please both types of followers and if you start being eclectic after being theme-driven or vice versa, or you suddenly switch themes, expect to lose some followers who got used to you being one way rather than the other. Although this can be the kiss of death on a blog, on Twitter it will usually mean merely some reshuffling of your followers but you should be ready for that.
Overdoing a personal @ conversation that leaves out other followers and goes on and on. On the one hand, it's nice to see that you're interacting directly but on the other hand, this carries the risk of making others feel left out and bored with your exchange. Use direct messages for lengthy personal interaction and get their email address!
People change. They grow up, they get jaded, they have exams, they change opinions, they change jobs, they get fed up with tweeting, etc. And that can be enough to cause them to unfollow you. In this case, it's just not personal!

, Many Twitter users are trying to raise interest in their ""get rich quick"" schemes through affiliate marketing schemes, or via their own sites that carry pay-per-click ads which they hope you'll pounce on. A lot of them are really deluded about the ad revenue they think they'll draw in and overdo the tweeting. That's part and parcel of business outreach but if it displeases you, then don't follow these types of tweets in the first place. It is far better to have a core bunch of followers whose material you really appreciate and who, in turn, really appreciate your tweets.


Related to this is being honest about your own unfollowing: most of us unfollow on occasion or even regularly, so we must accept that others will do likewise. On the whole, there are few Twitter users able to keep up with the thousands of followers. If they are, it leaves you wondering how, unless they're being paid to do it.

, On the whole, for those going out, there will be equal numbers coming in. Do this check over a period of days rather than minutes or hours, otherwise you'll risk feeling deflated if you're setting stock in balancing followers and unfollows. Try logging off for a bit and come back to find that people have found you in your absence. Treasure that and let it balance out the unfollows.

, It is what it is and nothing more. It is not your local social function, it is not a party, and it is not a performance assessment despite the barrage of nonsense about having huge numbers of followers. It's a place to come and go and to share information. Enjoy it and leave the worry about people ceasing to converse with you at real life functions. In which case, it's time to brush up on your face-to-face social skills!

Before jumping into social networking, consider what your demeanor will be online.,
Next, start living the exciting life of a social networker.,
Once you are familiar with the content of sites like Facebook, you can move to more sophisticated and specialized social networking websites.,
Next, build your online personality.,
Lastly, some social networkers find that blogs are not interactive enough.,
If you use Gmail, add your Twitter feed right into the sidebar.",How to Be a Social Networker," Some social net-workers use social media to exchange exciting ideas in any area from tech to finance to cooking. Others blog on emotional content such as dating and relationships. Decide what information you are comfortable with presenting online.;
, Begin with a free-access social networking site like Facebook. Facebook allows its users to “friend” one another and share photos as well as other features. Facebook is recommended over MySpace for a variety of reasons such as less advertisements and larger monthly growth rate.

, One way to do this is to pursue your interests and hobbies. You can also include your pets in the fun with sites like Catster. Social networks are often great places to discuss the news. Sites like Digg allow users to vote on or ""Digg"" which stories they like. Some social net-workers even participate in dating websites. If you are interested in sharing other forms of content such as video, photos and music, YouTube, Flickr, and Pandora are all good sites. The goal of this step is to transition from your original friendship base constructed in the previous step to broader friendship bases of shared interests.

, At this point, you likely have many online friends. Maintaining a blog is a great way to disseminate news, opinions, or any message. Sites like Blogger are a great starting point. Go to here for steps in starting a blog. If you are still not ready to start a blog, Twitter is a micro-blogging and social networking service. Twitter users post short status updates called tweets. If blogging is too “out there” for you, online diaries such as My-Diary are a great place to privately write your thoughts.

, The final and optional step is to take your social network into the virtual world. Sites like Second Life allow users to control their avatars inside of a virtual world where avatars meet, play and interact with one another. Other sites like IMVU offer 3D avatar chat. Virtual worlds serve as an extension of social networks providing users to share experience.

, You can do this with the Twitter Gmail gadget through the labs setting in your Gmail account.

Think before posting anything.",How to Clean Up Your Social Media Image," Doing a simple Google search of yourself will alert you to what information or pictures come up about you. This will help you better assess what things you need to change or add so that the message people see is more positive.Do an incognito Google search to see what the results are. You can open an incognito browser on your phone or computer.
You can open an incognito tab in Chrome by clicking the three vertical dots or horizontal lines in the top right corner of your browser and selecting “open an incognito tab.”
On a phone, if you open your browser, you can often select the icon that looks like two sheets of paper or two rectangles on top of each other. Once you select that, you can enter into “private mode.”;
, After doing an initial Google search of your name, do a few more detailed searches. Search for your first and middle names. Search for your first and last name and the city that you live in. Search for your name and the company you currently work for.

There are likely dozens of people with your name but if you search for yourself in a more detailed manner, you may find more information.

, Facebook has a feature that will allow you to view your page from the perspective of other’s viewpoints. You can simply go to your profile, click the ellipsis by “View activity log” and click “View As”. From here, you can view your page from the perspective of others.You might also consider making another temporary Facebook page that you can use to see how your profile looks to those who you are not friends with.

, The first step you can take in your social media cleanse journey is to delete any inappropriate or unflattering photos of yourself. Should an employer or school search your name or social media accounts, you don’t want them to find photos of you behaving poorly or engaging in any illicit behavior. Consider deleting photos that depict any of the following activities:Drug or alcohol use or photos of you under the influence
Sexual behavior
Nudity
Use of any gang signs or lewd hand gestures

, If you did not personally post the picture, you may need to request removal either from the social media site or from the person who posted it. You can untag these photos so that they don’t show up on your personal pages, but be aware that these images will still be online unless you get them removed., Though this might take some time, go through and review any negative statuses, tweets, or blog posts you may have put out. Delete anything related to sex or drugs or anything you may have posted that could be construed as racist, sexist, or homophobic.Exert extreme caution when posting anything in the future.

, Though employers will not likely care how many friends you have on facebook, you may notice that some on your friends list tag you in inappropriate or spammy posts. Delete any such friends so that they do not damage your online image.If you don’t want to delete them, consider reporting them when they tag you in such things or edit your settings to prevent them from tagging you.

, If you find that you are not truly utilizing all of your social media that much or that you have not checked one for months or years, consider deleting some of your accounts. The less you have, the easier it will be to monitor.Delete any unnecessary apps that you have added onto your social media. For instance, perhaps you play a lot of games on Facebook that crowds your wall or your friend’s newsfeed. Edit your settings so you are not posting each time you play.

, One way to do all of this cleansing a bit quicker is to utilize online services designed to assess problem areas on your social media sites. Consider using websites like Rep’nUp or Reputation defender., At the end of the day, you may have entirely too much to delete. If you feel this is true, you can simply delete all of your social media accounts and start from scratch. This will allow you to be much more intentional with what you post and who you add from here on after. It will also alleviate your worries about what others might or might not being seeing on your pages., In addition to cleaning up your image, you can also work to maintain more privacy so that only those you want to see your information are viewing it. Set all of your accounts to private, particularly while you are still in the clean up stages., You can also restrict who and when you are tagged in any posts. Go into the settings of your social media accounts and request to be sent a notification before being tagged in a picture or post., Another way to establish some privacy online is by not using your full name online. This will make it more difficult for others to find your pages. Consider using only your first and middle name and not your last name for your social media sites if you are looking to keep a low profile., Just as important as it is to remove any negative things from your social media, it is imperative to replace it with positive posts. Share articles that are factual, interesting, and non-inflammatory. Share positive posts about your life, family, and job. This will serve to replace any negative information that was previously circulating., Another way to create a more positive online footprint is to create a blog or website that markets you and your skills positively. Consider creating a blog writing about any interests, whether personal or professional, that you might have. Create a website that showcases your talents.When people google search you, this may be the first thing that comes up, so make sure that it is quality.

, Make sure that any email addresses or social media names that you are using are positive and appropriate. When in doubt over what name to use, simply use your first and middle name. For email accounts, use your first and last name.An example might be heather.chavis@123.com

, Choose a profile picture of you that is good quality, flattering, and not revealing. You can use your professional headshot or a picture of you doing something positive like volunteering or spending time with family.Make sure that your eyes are open, as well.

, You can also like and follow other pages to further rebrand yourself. Follow people whose work aligns with your interests. Share any articles or posts that interest you from these pages. Unfollow any pages that are lewd or obscene in any way., If you are looking to start a business or are recovering from a particularly damaging scandal, you may want to hire an image consultant to help you clean up your online footprint. This person will be able to instruct how and when to post certain information. They will also be able to assist you in deleting or spinning any negative information about you., Finally, as you are entering into this new, cleaner social media presence that you have created, strive to maintain it. Before you post anything, ask yourself the following questions:

Is this true?
Is this positive?
How would I think of someone else if they posted this?
Will it bring joy to others?

If you don't see Adverts Manager, look at the bottom of your homepage and click on Create Advert. You will need to enter your credit card details here in order to activate it.;
, Once you are in Adverts Manager, click on Create an Advert. Now you will see a list of options from where you need to select your objective. Select 'Send people to your website'. Enter the URL, which will be the landing page of your website. In case your goal is to achieve an email lead, enter the page where it asks the prospective customer to enter an email.

, Now you will come to a section asking you 'Who do you want your adverts to reach?' Here you can define the filters and qualification criteria of the audience you wish to target:


Custom audiences - If you have a custom list of emails or phone numbers for people whom you want to target through Facebook advertising, add them here. You can upload this list through a simple Excel file. Note that this will work only if the target audience has used these emails/phone numbers to create their Facebook account.
Location - Select your country, state or town.
Age - Select the age range.
Gender - Select any of all, men, women.
Languages - You can use language targeting as well. In case the prospective customer has entered that language in his or her Facebook profile settings, the potential customer can see your ad. Note that not all languages are available. In most cases, it is recommended that you select English (All).
More Demographics - This is where you can select relationship status, educational level, work status, whether a parent or not, etc. Multiple choices are possible here.
Interests - Select as required or leave blank.
Behaviors - Select as required or leave blank.
Advanced connection targeting - You can use this if you are the admin of the Facebook page of the website you are advertising for. For example, you can exclude people who have already liked your Facebook page by entering the name of the page in the exclude box. Thus, you will not waste your advertising on those who have already liked your page.

, This should give you an idea about the approximate possible audience of your Facebook ad and you can adjust the filters and targeting mentioned above to arrive at an optimal reach.

, For example, 250 per day, and enter a schedule with a start and end date. Make sure you select the correct month as well. If you want your ads to begin immediately, you can also select 'Run my ad continuously starting today'. Once approved, the ad will start and be live. You may pause it later or schedule an end date later if you want.

, This is what is recommended for general use. Or, you can look at the other options of paying for impressions or setting a maximum bid per click.

, Use Advert set name, by which you can name your set as something that represents the ads. For example, Company_Location_Clicks.

, The recommended size is 1200 X 628 pixels. You can upload up to six images and these will create six Facebook ads. These ads will come under the same advert set. Thus, the budget of 250 per day will be spent over all of these ads. If you selected ""Optimize for Clicks"", the ad that initially generates more clicks is likely to take precedence.

, Now you come to the section - 'What text and links do you want to use?' Firstly, connect your Facebook page if you have it. Clicking on your ad will take the user to your website but it will show as coming from your Facebook page.


Put in the headline and text of your ad. Select the call to action button. For example, you can use ""Learn more"". Note that there are character  limits for the text used and you will have to keep your creative text within those limits. Also note that choosing a Facebook page is required in order to include a call to action button.
Now select Advanced Options and enter the news feed link description. This is limited to 200 characters and will appear only if the ad displays in the news feed.
Now in the 'Advert preview and placements' section on the right, select where you would like the ad to show. For a clicks to website campaign, the news feed placement will be more productive. Therefore, it is recommended that you generally use only that. If this was an 'Increase likes to your page' campaign, you could Select All, since the like page option appears on the Facebook ad itself and it's easy to like the page on mobiles as well.

Reply to any new friend requests made to your Facebook account made by family and friends who did not have a Facebook connection with you prior to your death. Some people may feel this is the only way to reach your family or to leave messages of condolence with the family.

Have an interesting picture.,

This is your first line of offense. Having a bad picture and then expecting new friends, is like trying to pick up a girl with your hair a mess and just a tiny stream of diarrhea running out of your shorts and down your leg. It's not going to happen!
As a Myspace musician you will be judged over and over again. Leave them with a good first impression by having a good default pic. Here is what makes a good default pic:

Have a professional photo of you or your band taken at least once in your life.
Make sure the photo is a true reflection of you.
Edit the photo at a place like Picnik.com to make it stand out from the rest.
Use colors that stand out and catch the eye
Make sure at least one face is in the photo. People will make more of a connection with you if they can see you.

;
,


Okay so you've convinced someone to click on your profile picture and take a look at your page. Your goal is to make another great first impression. Having a good picture but a bad profile is like looking great and trying to pic up a girl. You flash your smile, say hello and THEN a little stream of diarrhea runs down your leg! She is walking away now! So as you can see, a good-looking Myspace page is very necessary. Here's how to get one:

Keep it neat, organized, and clean. Do not post 1000 pictures on your page and 500 videos. Not only is this very unattractive but it also creates extremely slow loading times. Make the rule of 2 pictures and 1 video on your page and no more. This doesn't include photos in your actually pictures section though. I am talking specifically about your main page.
Make the content worth reading. This is where you will inject a lot of life in your profile. Don't just list a bunch of facts about your band. Let your creativity shine through here.
It is strongly recommend that you hire a professional Myspace creator to make your page. They are not that expensive and are very much worth the money. If you can't afford one or are too cheap to spend the cash, learn as much HTML as you can to make your page look interesting and clean.



,


Lets go back to the picking up a girl analogy. You flashed your smile (default pic) you've charmed her (profile content) and with any luck you've gotten her number (acceptance of friend request). So far no diarrhea and the two of you are both happy about it. You've connected with her but that one time won't be enough. You are going to need to connect with her over and over again to make the relationship strong. Effectively connecting with your fans is going to be the deciding factor of whether they become lifetime fans or just lunch time fans. Here are some ways to keep them thinking of you:

Leave lots of comments. Yes, this is where you will need to make the time commitment. I've heard of some bands spending up to 4 hours a day connecting with their fans in this way. I'm not saying you need to spend that much time, but if you're not willing to make a time sacrifice for your fans, then you're in the wrong business. I recommend that all of my clients leave a comment on every new friends profile and then a follow up comment the next day. So if you get 100 new friends in one day, that's a total of 200 comments you will be leaving.
Make an AIM account so you can chat with your friends. Post your screen name on your profile and invite them to talk to you on aim. This is a very effective way of connecting with your fans and you will build some long lasting friendships using this method.
Shoot weekly video blogs. The more people see your face the more likely they are to remember you and visit you often. A video blog can be an update about your band or it can be just a funny video about nothing. I always prefer the funny videos about nothing though.
Post bulletins. Do not be an obsessive bulletin poster though. I have deleted bands just for the fact that they post too many bulletins. Once or twice a week is more than enough. Also, make the bulletins worth reading. Don't only post new ones to promote a show or a new song. Post a new bulletin just for the sake of entertaining your fans with no strings attached.

Since proxies get blocked often you should join a proxy mailing list to keep getting fresh proxies daily. You can find these online, but beware of out of date sites and links, since the services provided often change.

Look at the number of friends the person has.",How to Spot a Fake Celebrity MySpace Profile," Most likely, there will be a link to the person's Myspace page.;
, Unless the profile is new, they should have at least 1,000 friends, depending on their popularity.


Celebrities are usually very busy, and therefore, do not have time to be chatting with anyone online. If the person seems to be having conversations with another person (especially if the other person is a celebrity), he/she is a fake.
Celebrities are very personal people, and don't usually announce to the world who they're dating (especially not on Myspace). If the person has ""I love "", it's likely a poser.
For the most part, celebrities try to be as professional on Myspace as possible. They should be promoting their latest projects and inform their fans of any news they have.
Posers are usually very insecure when it comes to whether or not other people will believe them. Real Myspace profiles most likely will not have ""This is the real me. If you don't believe then don't add"".
