Change your name to something short and cool.,
Get rid of whatever glitzy, flashing Myspace layout you had before.,
Delete the lengthy About-Me.,
Replace your old 'About-Me' with a short, amusing quote in quotation marks.,
In your Interests boxes, pick and choose which ones to bother with.,
Get pictures on your page.Get pictures of your friends.Edit them and put bestie or wife etc.,
Keep your pictures (as in the ones in My Photos, or any other album, not in the Interests section) to a minimum.,
The same goes for albums.,
Vary your photos.,
Don't add an excess of randoms.,Try putting codes to not show comments and/or friends because then it will make you know like you have used Myspace for a while and you know what you are doing and a lot of people try to steal friends from friends so if you hide yours, it will get them wondering and they will KEEP visiting your page ;)

",How to Look Cool on MySpace," Examples for girls: Vee, Bea, Jeci, Petta, Nico, Viva, Ivy. Examples for boys: Mort, Slate, Tum, Joe, Pikey. Or choose a short, sweet nickname used in your early childhood. It's best if this name is spelt out all in lower-case and followed by a full stop. Name generators are great way to figure out a great name.;
, Just go back to the original, plain Facebook-like one you're given to start with. Or just get a very simple Myspace layout with a cool design or a nice color.

, Chances are it's full of cringe worthy lines such as 'I don't care what anyone thinks about me' or 'I live life each day as it comes'. Very cliché. But a) no one cares and b) you're much better off without it. Try to write something that is less stereotypical, like what are you going to college for or what you do in your spare time. Writing something like ""I like hanging with my friends, texting, boys, and going to the mall"" means tramp.

, Now this could also go horribly wrong. No blonde jokes, or in fact any jokes at all. Perhaps something funny a friend said once. Make it like a quote-board.

, Put a few photos you've uploaded from photobucket in. This is Myspace which is more graphics and media based, save the interests for Facebook. People don't really take the time to read their interest. Clip art based on your interests will give the person an idea at a glance. For example, you like rap music, you put a few pictures of your favorite rappers on your profile.

, Try to get cool effects and Photoshop a little bit. Myspace is more for graphic designer type people.

, Have plenty of tagged photos (it shows you're popular and well liked) but what ever you do, DO NOT create a fake tagged photos folder (yes, some people are stupid enough to try). Keep your main album down to about 8 photos at most. Have at least 2 of you on your own looking attractive, at least one of you with a member of the sex you're interested in(makes you look appealing), and at least one of you with a friend/friends/family. Include prom and sport photos and just hanging out. It is great to have a photo of your interest to have a glimpse to people what you are like.

, Try to keep them to a minimum as well.

, Don't upload a bunch of pictures that all look pretty much the same. That just gets boring.

, It makes you look desperate. Judge your Myspace popularity by your profile views, not by your friend count. Randoms could be dangerous and when you read the status feed, it won't be as interesting as your local friends.

Post daily.,
Be controversial.",How to Compose Interesting Tweets on Twitter," This is the most important way to make your Twitter posts interesting. Nobody likes reading the same rehashed material over and over. If you want to grow and get followers, you need to post interesting and original material.


Original posts could be your own thoughts or ideas, things you observe, or just amusing things that you think others might find amusing as well.;
, With only 140 characters available to write, be sure to take advantage of the space. Too many people post a few words at the time. The things you say may be just as funny out of context since you do not have much space to explain a whole story, but be sure to use the space you DO have available to you!

, Believe it or not, simple observations are a way to get people to relate to you. You want your followers to read your post and laugh out loud because it is a relatable experience that brings back a memory of an experience they had.


This can be anything from family, work, friends, or sometimes things people do not typically talk about.

, We all know people who join social networking sites and post just once a month. This is not going to make you popular with anyone. As a matter of fact, not being active is the number 1 way to lose followers.


Remember, nobody wants to follow someone who has nothing to say day after day!

, This last step is not for everybody, but if you know exactly how to do it, and like to do it, then you will be successful. Post things that will make people think because when you have people thinking, odds are others are going to be angry.


Controversial posts will cause sharing, discussion, fights, and so on.
It will make your tweets go around the Twitter sphere and therefore make you more interesting.
If you keep these simple steps in mind when posting on your Twitter account, you will have no problem becoming one of the most popular and interesting people on Twitter!

Think of something short.,
Make it catchy.,
Make sure it’s relevant to you.,
Avoid using numbers.,
Keep it simple.",How to Choose a Twitter Handle," One or two-word handle names are very easy to remember. Usernames like “@johndoe” is much easier to remember than “@misterjohnathandoe.”


Twitter also limit tweets to 140 characters at max, so if another user tweets something on your account, your handle will also use those 140 characters, leaving other users very few characters to write tweets with.;
, Think of a Twitter name that’s easy to remember even if you’ve just heard it for the first time. Putting an adjective before your name is a great way to make it sound unique and catchy to the ears.


In example: “@CoolCarlson” or “@AwesomeAnna”

, If your Twitter account’s all about food, dining, and eating, don’t use something that’s way off the relativity chart, like “@HotRod” or “@CoolCat.” Use something relevant like “@CoolChef” or “@AwesomeDining.” This way, other users can easily figure out what your tweets are about even before they start following you.

, Twitter names are not the same as email addresses. Although it’s very tempting to just put in numbers after your name, it’s really not recommended, especially if you want to make your account as unique as possible. Using “@john1000” as your Twitter name may be much easier, but expect that there are 999 other “John” users on Twitter that can be mistaken for your account.

, Unique doesn’t mean you have to be complex about it. Avoid using deep words like “breviloquence” when all you really mean is “short.” Instead of using “@impressiveconceptualizations,” why not just use “@CoolConcepts” or “@CoolIdeas.” Not only is it short and catchy, it’s simple enough for users to describe you.

Avoid sharing about controversial topics.,
Act like you’re sharing with someone who is right beside you.,
Keep your sharing positive.,
Consider who is going to see your posts.,
Avoid sharing information about bodily functions and changes.",How to Avoid Oversharing on Social Media1," Certain topics like politics, religion, and polarizing issues can cause heated arguments and may alienate some of your followers. If you don't want to engage in arguments or lose followers, avoid posting about these topics or post neutral comments.
, It’s easy to post or reblog something instantaneously, without giving it much thought. But is the story, image, or other content you’re posting really necessary? Does it contain content you’d feel was appropriate to communicate to someone in person? If not, reconsider sharing it at all.Imagine your mom, brother, or best friend is sitting beside you while you share something online. Would they be upset by what you’re posting? Offended? Grossed out? If so, don’t post it.
Use your judgement and try to imagine how you would feel if you randomly stumbled across the content you intend to post.

, Instead of posting about negative interactions with others, post only information about your positive interactions. For instance, don’t post content related to your child’s misbehavior or a conflict you got into with your spouse. Instead, post content related to your child’s good grades, or a pleasant date you went on with your spouse.Posting negative content is quite personal and could make others uncomfortable – even if they are not referenced directly in your post.

, If you’re using strong language in a post, you might want to limit it to only certain people, or adjust the settings on the post so that certain individuals cannot see your post. Or out of respect for your parents, for instance, you might choose to prohibit them from seeing your posts regarding a certain sensitive topic. Think carefully about your audience before sharing to social media.In other cases, you might want to share an inside joke with friends. Instead of opening the post up to all your social media followers, you might instead just send the joke as a group message directly to your friends.

, Nobody wants to know about your most recent bowel movement. Likewise, avoid sharing information (including imagery) about menstruation, colonoscopies, and urination. Unless you’re pregnant, losing weight, or have a cold, avoid sharing details about your physical condition and bodily habits.You can tastefully share some physical states or events. For instance, you might post that you gave birth to a child on social media. You could even post an image of the newborn wrapped snugly in a blanket. But it would be inappropriate to post an image of your child being born.

Keep personal information to yourself.,
Keep your social media profiles private.,
Turn off automatic location functions.,
Don’t check in everywhere you go.,
Don’t announce vacations or absences from home ahead of time.",How to Avoid Oversharing on Social Media2," Sharing the names of your pets, your grandmother’s name, or your favorite movie could lead to problems later on. This unique identifying information often composes the security questions for banks, credit cards, and other financial information. Oversharing personal info, therefore, can lead to identity theft.Remember that anything you post on the internet is in the public domain, even if you use privacy settings. While social media is a great way to stay in touch with friends and family, other people may also be able to see what you post.

, If possible, only post information privately. On social media platforms that do not allow private posting, post as little as possible. Try to limit yourself to reposts of existing material – links to articles or songs you liked, for instance.Keeping your social media profile private means that you’ll only be sharing with a select few people (your friends or approved followers).

, Many apps have automatic check-in options to let people know where you are. This can be very dangerous for you and your family because it tells people where you are at the moment. Someone who has bad intentions can use that information to rob your home while you're away. By turning your location function off on your phone or tablet, you’ll be better able to control who knows where you are, what you’re doing, and when you’re doing it.If you need to use your GPS, just turn the location function back on.
Consult your user guide for your phone or tablet for more information about how you can turn off location sharing features.

, Most people neither need nor want to know where you went grocery shopping, or what dog groomer you took your pet too. You can easily avoid oversharing these superfluous details of your day by turning off automatic location functions.Additionally, think carefully about where you check-in. Limit check-ins to special events and trips. Don’t check-in when visiting your friends, the laundromat, or other places that do not hold special interest. Additionally, don’t check-in from places far from home, since this will alert potential criminals that you won’t be returning to your home any time soon.

, Like most people, you probably have many “friends” on social media who are in fact little more than acquaintances. Letting these people know that you will be away from home for a certain length of time might increase the likelihood that they will use this information to rob or vandalize your house."

Don’t share pictures of others without consent.,
Don’t share incriminating information.,
Don’t post anything related to your work.",How to Avoid Oversharing on Social Media3," If you’re taking pictures of friends or even family members, they might not like the pictures. And if they don’t like the pictures, they probably won’t want them available for the whole world to see on social media. Ask friends and others in the images you take if it is alright to post them on social media.In some places, posting images of children – even your own children – without their approval is illegal.
If your child is old enough to ask whether you’re posting a photo of them online, you should ask them if it is okay for you to do so.
Even if others approve you posting the photo, think twice before doing so. Oversharing images of yourself with your friends or your children might grow tiresome for people consuming your social media.

, There are a number of things you could say on social media that might damage your reputation or even get you in legal trouble. For instance, if you post how drunk you were last night (or drunk you are currently), the post might give a future employer or college application evaluator the wrong impression about who you are.Employers and colleges often check social media accounts, so your controversial posts could cost you your job or education.
Likewise, if you are an illegal immigrant, you should not post information about how you came to be in your current country, or mention your current legal status.

, Posting critical comments about your coworkers, employer, or employees could land you in hot water. Even posting something good, though, might get you in trouble. For instance, if your employer sees you were using social media instead of working, they might be upset. Avoid sharing anything about your work experiences on social media.If you want, you could share where you work, but never relate stories about your workday on social media.
Assume your employer will see all your social media posts.

Talk to your friends outside of social media.,
Respond to other posts.,
Unplug for a while.,
Watch for signs of social media or internet addiction.",How to Avoid Oversharing on Social Media4," Instead of sharing everything you want to say to your friends on social media, catch up with them later and strike up a conversation about whatever it is you want to communicate. You can communicate with your friends about both online content and real-world situations or ideas. For instance, if you have a funny video you want your friends to see, arrange to meet them and say, “I have a funny video I think you’d like to see. Let’s watch it together.”That way, you will ensure that they see it, since many people have so much information coming through their social media that they don’t have time to check it all.
You’ll also avoid oversharing since you’re adding one less post to social media.
Don't forget the importance of face-to-face and phone conversations.

, There’s more to social media than just posting your own content about your own life. Limit your risk of oversharing by browsing news articles and commenting on friends’ pages. Try to put the “social” in social media.It’s especially important to respond to your friends’ posts regarding sincere emotional pain. It's even better if you call or visit them as well.
Responding to other posts on some social media platforms is best done through built-in approval indicators or by rebroadcasting the post you identified with, enjoyed, or found amusing.

, Spend at least a day or two each week where you don’t use social media at all. This will give you time to decompress from the information overload that can take hold of even seasoned web users. Taking time away from social media will reduce the pressure you might sometimes feel to contribute new content to your social media streams, which can lead to oversharing.If you find you’re checking social media so much that it interferes with your work, academic, or real social life, implement a steeper cut in your social media usage.
There are many things you can do instead of oversharing on social media. For instance, you could play baseball with your friends. You could invite your family for a hike in the woods.
If you prefer spending time alone off of social media, you could catch up on your reading or learn how to bake a new recipe.
Think about some of your favorite hobbies and spend time doing them instead of oversharing on social media.

, Social media and the internet can reward your brain in the same way that drugs do, and they can cause you to become overstimulated if you use them throughout the day. You need to make sure that you have a life and interests outside of social media.If you find yourself constantly checking your accounts or struggling with oversharing, look for the symptoms of addiction:

Feelings of guilt
Anxiety
Depression
Dishonesty
Euphoric feelings when in front of the computer
Unable to keep schedules
No sense of time
Isolation"

Know what trolls are, and what their activities are.,
Rationally consider people's feelings.,
Stay away from the temptations.,
Be civil.,
Do not respond with rudeness if someone is rude or inflammatory towards you.,
Stay calm if someone gives you some sort of warning that you are going too far.,
Stop arguing and take a break from the site if arguments start to escalate.",How to Avoid Being an Internet Troll," After all, without knowing troll's behavior, some would be confused with trolls just because they do not know how to behave. Be informed.;
, People behind the computers have emotions just like you., The temptations may be insulting somebody's work, or a thread showcasing low quality images from sites like DeviantART.

, This is fairly simple; it is just basic etiquette. Don't swear at others. Don't say rude things, such as ""I hate you."" Don't post any sort of content which you know is inappropriate. If you can't be reasonably polite to others, being anything but a troll will be impossible.

, There are better ways to deal with a troll. Trying to get revenge on a troll just looks bad and only encourages more encounters. It doesn't matter that ""they started it"", it just matters that you behaved badly.

, Figure out what you did wrong and make sure you do not do it again. Perhaps you need to take a break and calm down.

, Doing this will help stop the argument, and in many cases, the conflict will just fade away as nobody participates

Limit your visibility.,
Check your facts.,
Consider the impact before you post.,
Use humor.",How to Avoid Conflicts About Political Topics on Social Media1," One way that you can avoid conflicts about political issues is to set your privacy settings so that only people you approve can see your posts.Limiting your visibility will prevent people that might disagree with your political opinions from seeing your posts. If they can’t see them then they can’t respond to them or create conflict.


On Facebook, go to your account settings and select ‘privacy.’ Select the desired options for who can see your posts and profile information.
If you are using Instagram, go to settings and select your desired privacy settings. For example, you can select who sees your posts, who can respond, as well as block specific people from seeing your posts.
Snapchat allows you to select whether everyone sees your post or only specific people each time you post something.
Review your privacy options in other social media app settings like Tumblr, Twitter, and Pinterest to limit your visibility.;
, One thing that ‘internet trolls’ look for are posts that contain incorrect information presented as a fact. They often ridicule, share, and leave comments that might create conflict when they find something inaccurate in a post. If you are posting something as a fact, check with various reputable sources to make sure that your information is correct before posting it.If you are sharing a news report make sure that you check the original source and that the source is reliable.
If something is your opinion and not a fact, then you might want to say something like, “In my opinion” or “I think.”
If you are reposting something that someone else posted, you can mention that your content is a repost. You can say, “This is a repost that I liked.”

, The simplicity of sharing your opinion on social media makes it easy to post content without considering the effect it will have. Thinking about how someone else might interpret your post or whether it might be seen as controversial can help you avoid conflict.


Try to look at your post objectively. If the language were different would you find it offensive? For example, if you’re thinking about posting a meme making fun of Republicans, ask yourself, “Would this be funny if it were about Democrats?”
Think about who might be offended or have a negative comment about your post. For example, consider whether the post is rude, mean, or discriminatory.

, Humor is always good at reducing tension and preventing conflict from popping up. In, fact nearly half of people that view political posts view humorous pics, videos, and content. If you want to post political content without causing conflict, consider posting things that are comical.Instead of directly posting your opinion, try to find a meme or video that represents how you feel.
Remember that not everything is funny to everyone. Avoid posts making fun of others’ race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender.

Be selective in who and what you follow.,
Know who you’re friending.,
Resist posting controversial political content.,
Post neutral political comments.",How to Avoid Conflicts About Political Topics on Social Media2," If you accept all friend requests and follow everyone that requests it, you are bound to see something political on your timeline that upsets you. One way that you can avoid conflict about political topics on social media is to only follow people and topics that interest you and align with your values.Avoid following organizations, groups, or pages with controversial names. For example, the group ‘Political Protesters’ might not be very neutral.
It’s okay to unfollow or block certain friends if you know you can’t avoid getting into a conflict with them about political topics.

, Before you accept friend or follow requests, make sure that you actually know the person making the request. If you know the person, you will have some idea of whether they might post political content that’s controversial.


Visit their page or profile, if possible, to get a sense of them as a person.
Be wary of accounts that were recently created, have vague or no bio/profile information, and no pictures or generic pictures.
Some social networking apps allow you to temporarily hide certain users or content from your timeline.

, Even though you may have political opinions you want to express, you may want to reconsider doing it through social media. If you don’t post anything that might be controversial, it’s much less likely that you will have a conflict about political topics.Post content about neutral topics like your personal experiences and memories. For example, you might post pictures from your recent vacation.
This includes reposting or sharing political content that other people have posted. If you really want to share it, then do so in a private message.

, If you want to post political content, you can if you make sure that your posts aren’t controversial. Try to post political content that is neutral, balanced, and fair in order to avoid creating conflict.For example, instead of posting something judging a political party or movement, you could post something encouraging people to be politically active in general.
Or, for instance, instead of posting a video condemning a political opinion, post a balanced commentary about the issue.

Or, perhaps, something you post causes someone to respond critically or even with hostility. If this occurs, take a few moments to calm down before you respond. This small break will give you the chance to think about the appropriate way to respond without creating more conflict.You could say something to create conflict by responding to a post or comment when you are upset.
If you need to express yourself, write what you would comment in your journal or an email to yourself.

, If someone is trying to argue with you online about political topics you may be able to avoid a conflict if you talk to them in private.Let them know that you don’t want to argue publicly or privately about political issues.


You might say, “I know we all have our opinion but I don’t want to argue with you about this topic. I respect your opinion, please respect mine.”
Or, you might say, “We can disagree with one another, but let’s do it respectfully.”

, If you’ve posted political content and it’s causing controversy then you should consider deleting the post before it creates greater conflict. Most websites and apps make it easy to remove content that has been posted. Usually you can click ‘help’ and find instructions for removing a comment.


If it's something you posted on Facebook you can click the ‘X’ in the top right corner of the post and press ""Remove Post"".

""Notifications Tab"" controls the kind of activity that pops up at the bottom of your screen when you're on the Twitter homepage.

, If you have mobile notifications turned on, this is where you'll see a list of all of the individual notification types you can toggle on or off. If you don't have them turned on, you'll see an option to enter your phone's settings to turn them on. Toggle each individual setting to turn notifications of that type on or off.









If you have a broad base of followers that you don't have much one-on-one interaction with, you may wish to turn off notifications when your tweets are retweeted.
If you frequently receive spam in your Direct Message, you may wish to turn off notifications when you're sent a DM.
If you're often mentioned in tweets that you aren't interested in keeping track of, you may wish to turn off notifications for when tweets you're mentioned in are retweeted or liked.
If contacts who you aren't close to are joining Twitter often, you may wish to turn off notifications for when somebody in your address book joins Twitter.

Respond politely to all requests.,
Make sure that you are correct in your perception of the situation.,
Decide how you are going to respond.

,
Use logic to arrive at your position.

,
State your case thoroughly and succinctly, including the most pertinent facts.,
Send your message to the flamer and be done with it.,
Be careful about any responses you may get.",How to Avoid a Flame War," In most instances, this is all that is needed, but if you are dealing with a flamer, things will begin to escalate. The would-be flamer is likely to seize on the issue, and refuse to let go of the matter. If he or she wants to argue about the finer points, or wants to enlarge the scope of a disagreement, proceed carefully.



 ;
, Don't be afraid to seek guidance from trusted members of your internet community before responding. Know all you can about the situation. And know that you are right before defending yourself.

,,, Phrase your answer plainly and dispassionately. Your flamer is probably very emotional about this issue and perhaps about life in general. He is hoping you will respond in an emotional way. Don't do it. Avoid sarcasm, and don't be mean. Your goal is to cool down the situation, not to incite further hard feelings.

, In other words, take swift action. Once.

, Do not feel the need to explain your motives, the full background of position and your right to be a part of the community, and your entire life history. A flamer will demand all of that from you and more. Don't get sucked in. If he writes to you to seek more information, just refer him back to your original note and say that is all you have to say on the matter. What a flamer wants is not resolution of the issue, but rather, a fight. Don't entertain this kind of conversation. Don't play that game.

Make your profiles private.,
Disable geotagging.,
Use a different username for every social media site you're on.,
Hide your contacts.,
Use security features.,
Delete old accounts.,
Remove yourself from search engines.",How to Avoid Being Stalked on Social Media1," Each social media site allows you to decide what information is shared with the web and what is private or shared with contacts. Take advantage of this feature and easily protect yourself from a stalker. Set your settings to only share information and interact with friends or contacts.Be vigilant on all of your social media platforms and adjust your privacy settings.


If you have accounts on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Instagram, and Youtube, for instance, make sure check your privacy settings on each and maximize them across the board.;
, Geotagging automatically shows your location from your smartphone. This can be dangerous because a stalker can know where you are and, more importantly, if you’re at your home or away. Go to the application’s settings on your phone and disable geotagging or location features.Turn off all location and geotagging services for social media.

, If your username on Facebook is “puppiesandcookies"", anyone can plug that into a search engine and find your other profiles under that username. If you have multiple social media accounts, use a different username for each one. This will help protect your privacy and make things more difficult for a stalker.Don't keep the same username and just add hyphens or change a few letters. A skilled cyberstalker will know how to find your account if the name has only had minimal changes.
Have a different email address, too.

, If you have a friends list on your social media account, hide it. A stalker may try to reach out to a friend of yours in order to get close to you. Your friends or contact list can be managed through your privacy settings.

Let your friends know about the stalker and not to respond to strange messages or contact requests.

, Keep your computer free from threats or breaches in security by installing safety software and a firewall.If you use an account from another computer, log out before you leave. If you fear the stalker may try to break into your account, create a secure password.

Make sure no one can use or find your information, from the outside or the inside.

, If you have old accounts that are currently inactive, delete them. This is especially important if the sites have personal information or photos of you. Think back to any accounts you opened when you were younger and have since abandoned. You might need to change the password if you’ve forgotten it. Log on, then delete the account entirely.For example, if you have an old Myspace account that you haven’t used in years, take it down. It might have photos or information that you don’t want to be shared with a stalker.

, Taking your private information off is a way to protect your identity on the internet beyond social media. While search engines will rarely remove content on your behalf, you can take some steps to minimize what shows up when your name if searched. Do a search on your own and deal with each result individually.


For example, if your search result comes up with Pinterest boards, unlist your pins and change your account privacy.
If you fear for your safety and want to take every measure possible to remain safe, remove your internet identity.

Don’t accept new friend or follow requests.,
Ask them to stop.,
Avoid interacting.,
Block suspicious accounts.,
Turn off messaging.",How to Avoid Being Stalked on Social Media2," Stalkers may create a fake account impersonating someone else in hopes of getting close to you. If you get a new friend or follow request, don’t accept it. Delete it or do not click on it. Don’t message them and say, “Who is this?” or, “Do I know you?” as this can open lines of communication with someone who might be your stalker.Let your friends know about your stalker and that they might reach out to them to get to you.

, If you know the person who is stalking you, ask them to stop. Request one time in writing for them to stop their behavior, then do not interact or speak to them again. Save any correspondence in digital and hard-copy forms.For example, say, “I don’t like the messages and comments you send me. I am asking you to stop. Thank you.”

, Don’t interact in any way with your stalker. Whether you know them in your everyday life or you only know of their internet activity, stay away. They might try to escalate the situation or say things they know will upset you or intrigue you in order to get you to respond or write back. Don’t take the bait.Do, however, keep a written record of anything they have sent you, including texts, messages, pictures, threats, etc.

, If you know there's a stalker viewing your accounts, and you're aware of the stalker's account(s), block them! The block feature on every site is different, so you may not be able to hide everything, but it can do something to stave them off.Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Google+, Youtube, Instagram all have options to completely block a person or a profile.
If they create new accounts, block those, too.

, Some social media accounts have a messaging feature, and strangers can use this to contact you. You can turn off messaging applications and block people you are not connected with. This means that even if they create alternate profiles they still cannot contact you.

For example, Facebook has a feature in which people who are not friends cannot message you or send you a friend request.

Avoid tagging photos.,
Privatize online photo albums.,
Upload small pictures.",How to Avoid Being Stalked on Social Media3," Don't tag others, and don't allow others to tag you. Once you link to someone else's profile through tagging, big privacy holes open up. A person can see any other pictures of you or your family and friends, and they'll also see the comments you left (and the comments people left about you). Their photo privacy settings could affect your safety.Make sure your photos are not geotagged.
Turn on a feature on some social media sites to approve tags before they appear on your profile. That way, you can not approve and they will not show up.

, Make any online photo albums private, too, especially if you embed pictures from those albums onto your social media profiles. For example, if you use a cloud or photo sharing platform, make all of your albums private or shareable only by you.

For example, if you use photos from your Google account on your blogger account, check the settings to make sure the content you want private is private.

, Even if your profiles are private, people can find the original version of your profile picture or avatar (the high resolution one) and download it. Upload pictures in low resolution. This way, they cannot zoom in on you or your features.If your profile picture is public, consider using a picture that is not a close-up of you. You might want to post a picture of something that is not you, like phrase or a saying, or anything that won’t fuel a creep’s obsession.

Report threatening activity.,
Log and report the stalker's IP address.,
Open a support ticket.",How to Avoid Being Stalked on Social Media4," If you feel threatened and fear for your safety, reach out to someone in authority for help, like a police officer. You might be able to get an order of protection or prosecute the person, as cyberstalking is illegal.When going to the police, gather all evidence and present it. State why you feel threatened and what you want to be done.

, You can track and report your stalker’s IP address. Some blog-based social media sites, like Tumblr and Wordpress, permit an IP logger to be installed on your account. Find a tool that can be installed on your social media page, such as Statcounter, and install it on your account. This can be used in different ways; you can simply track the IP addresses visiting your blog, block the IP address(es) of your stalker, or search the IP address on a site like Whois.


You can also contact their internet service provider (ISP) or your own ISP and request messages or contact to be blocked., If you know you're being stalked by someone and know the name(s) of their account(s), and blocking them and/or hiding your accounts isn't doing the trick, try to find some way of contacting the site's administrators or ""help desk"". Open a support ticket, and list all the information you need to in the support ticket; you'll have to input an email address, proof of harassment (this is where an IP logger can come in handy), and anything else you may need.


An example of what to say might be, ""This user has been using Tumblr to watch my account and send me threatening messages. I've tried hiding the web version of my blog, but I think they're using the app to get around that. I've also blocked their account, and installed an IP logger on my blog, but they can still contact me. Please do something about this account.""
Keep in mind that not all support tickets will get looked at. Particularly if the site's staff is known to not be very friendly or helpful to its users, you may not get much help.

Be realistic about the potential of social media to spur political or social change.,
Understand the negativity about social media being viewed as a tool for political change.,
Use social media to learn about other perspectives and to grow in deeper understandings.,
Seek what's really happening.",How to Use Social Media to Spur Political Change1," While social media is becoming one increasingly important factor in guiding how we live and interact in our globally connected world, it's obviously not the only factor. Yet, it's clearly an important factor, especially when it comes to coordinating, mobilizing, giving very up-to-the-moment information, and ensuring a morale boost of great immediacy to those participating in political or social change.


The real power of social media is in the fact that you, and all of your friends, coworkers, family members, fellow consumers, and everyone else around you regardless of age, gender, class, or employment status, who has access to social media tools, has automatic access to tools of change. For the first time in history, the immediacy and breadth of access allows almost everyone to have a say, or to watch what's happening, or to become actively engaged in supporting and clarifying what is going on.
However, bear in mind that other factors feed into political change, such as the time being right, there being enough people ready for change, and the availability of basic essentials such as food, shelter, electricity/energy (it's a bit hard to tweet or update without it), good health, and affordability of the tools giving access to social media platforms. And literacy is a must. And clearly not everyone has access to these tools (for example, in Bhutan, access to the internet is extremely controlled and during a crisis, governments have already shown a willingness to interfere with the communications systems). Nevertheless, given what has already been shown as possible, it's now valid to say that activists and visionaries can seize the opportunity inherent in social media to help spur political change.;
, There are the those who argue that social media is not creating political or social change and that it's a poor choice of tool to evoke such change.Others feel that it's overstepping the mark to suggest that social media can serve as a such a tool although it does play a particular role. Yet, recent events showing dissent against authoritarian governments have proven that social media is effective as a participant in spurring political and social change. And as Professor Clay Shirky points out, while detractors may argue that a bunch of people clicking on ""Save Darfur"" might not be any more helpful than bumper sticker activism, it's wrong to assume from that that people using social media in a concerted and directed way as part of their activist agenda aren't going to be successful doing so.It's recommended that you make up your own mind about the utility and power of social media for you, based on what has already worked for other people and on your own comfort level with using the tools of social media.

, Whatever else social media can or cannot do, it provides a platform for people to present conflicting views free of government indoctrination or silencing, and in a way that permits of a conversation between differing worldviews. This conversation between global citizens can share a wealth of information and ideas that may be new or even confronting to one another but are views all worthy of consideration. Indeed, Professor Clay Shirky believes that this fertile ground for exchange of dissenting and differing views in the public sphere often projected from our home sphere is far more alive and motivating than abstract political ideals., Another benefit of social media is the lack of sanitization of information provided by the average person holding a cell phone in the thick of the dissent or updating via their laptop in a cafe around the corner from events as they're unfolding. While some people may prefer not to see the graphic images or retelling, it's only by really knowing the full, terrible extent of something that isn't right in society that people can be truly moved to want change. The shock, horror, fear, and disgust of those using social media on-the-ground can be a huge source of motivation and understanding to everyone else reading their commentary and updates. The fact that governments-in-trouble are trying to block access to social media platforms speaks volumes."

If you haven't already, open your own social media accounts.,
Develop a good profile on your social media accounts.,
Start making as many friends as possible.,
Befriend as many influential individuals as possible.",How to Use Social Media to Spur Political Change2," The more popular the medium, the better. Facebook and Twitter have a large number of users and therefore are currently the best options, although you'll learn about some broader possibilities below.


Read How to How to make a new Facebook account, How to How to create a Facebook page for a business, How to How to make a Twitter account for more information.
It's preferable that you interact with people as an individual. While companies, organizations, and their ilk are flocking to social media, their aim is to sell and promote their goods and services, which is not quite the same personal connection that you'll have as an individual. Even if you're part of an activist organization, it's still recommended you maintain a unique, accessible individual profile.

, Your profile matters a great deal to people making a decision as to whether to follow you or not. If you have a cause, be loud and proud about it and use the linking sections to send people to a relevant website or blog of yours that contains information about what you're doing in terms of the cause or protest. While you don't need to be an expert with a degree as such, you do need to demonstrate that you have knowledge, experience, and a passion for whatever it is you're campaigning about.

, The greater the number of friends you have in your social media networks, the more influence you will exert in the social media community as a whole. There is power in numbers and the more people who follow your updates, the more likely that your information is being passed on the people well beyond your direct sphere of influence.

, Influential individuals are those with a large number of contacts or those in positions of authority. They are also people who have prominent roles, websites, positions, etc., that are relevant to the cause or protest that you're campaigning for. Befriending and sharing the information from these influential people will greatly magnify your sphere of influence.


Be aware that social media influential status is not necessary one of fame in other walks of life. You need to look for people who are influential within the social network itself, and within the cause or protest you're concerned about. The person may well have been an unknown before they took up the social media medium and started being effective within it. What matters is that they're known for being influential and they've got a lot of followers who regularly share their information around. One very good source of finding out who is influential is Klout.

Broaden your connectivity to others by broadening what you perceive as social media.",How to Use Social Media to Spur Political Change3," Don't stop at Twitter and Facebook. There is also the rest of the internet, your cell phone (and even the landline phone), word-of-mouth within your walkable community, chatrooms, posters, advertisements. While some of these are more old-fashioned than others, they're still forms of social or citizenry media when produced by the average citizen seeking to engage others in constructive political or social change. Neglecting these other tools can lessen your overall impact. Think laterally and make use of the many possible ways, including ones yet to be thought of – perhaps it's you who will come up with more ideas for inter-citizenry connectivity. For the moment, some great ways to get people interested, concerned, and motivated about a particular cause include (and while these could be alone, they're probably best done in combinations):



Facebook group: Make a Facebook group. This will let you maintain regular updates, links, and analysis.

Hashtags: Develop a hashtag on Twitter. And keep your own Twitter updates informative, thoughtful, relevant, and current as the issue unfolds and increases.

Photos: Use photos on sites like Flickr and Picasa, or through Twitter and Facebook. Graphic images can have tremendous impact on people; images of war have always helped people to better understand the horrors, for instance.

Videos: Use video. Add videos to YouTube that show the issue, or are discussions or analyses about the issue. Other successful methods might include photo collages with information superimposed, or even background information for those who might not yet grasp all the issues (never assume anything!).

Interviews: Use interviews with people directly affected. If you're in the thick of it, do some citizen journalism and post online, either video or audio. Provide some analysis if needed.

Email lists: For example, when your cause celebrates a victory, it's a great idea to do a round-up of the issues and outcome for all your supporters on your email list, such as when a law case is successful in preventing an environmental disaster, or a revolution succeeds and you'd like to thank your social media network for their engagement in the issue.

Surveys or petitions: Avaazis a great example of a site that gets people to sign petitions about major causes, with the aim of being a campaigning community bringing people-powered politics to decision-making worldwide. Sending an email out or using Twitter and Facebook and asking people to sign a petition can be another effective way of getting support and spreading the word.

Texting: Use texting on phones. Something as simple as the campaign used by Philippine protest in 2001 where people sent messages ""Go 2 ESDA. Wear blk""can be very effective in getting people to one place, wearing colors of solidarity.

Advertisements: Fill commonly frequented spaces with ads, such as the current Washington DC metro ad campaign to close Guantanamo. This should segue into social media tools by providing web addresses, Twitter and Facebook links, etc., so that people can check out for more details online and continue following.

Good old print media: And don't forget booklets, pamphlets, stickers, and other print items if you're on-the-ground. These old-fashioned methods of information-spreading may be a lot older than the internet but people who rally or demonstrate are just as willing to accept a printed item that might update them on happenings or offer advice and resources. And if the communications systems are clogged by interfering authorities, then the printed word passed out by hand still counts.

Anchor your cause in what you already know, care about, and action in your daily interactions.,
Get a sense of what motivates people.,
Write passionately about the political change you feel is necessary and that many people would support.",How to Use Social Media to Spur Political Change4," There isn't much point wanting to be the spark that creates political or social change if it's not of interest to you or is too distant from your own passions and beliefs to be genuine. This is not about simply drumming up a bandwagon of excitement for a current issue; you'll only come across as genuine if you're already known for caring about the issues that have sparked the need for political change. For example, you might consistently tweet or update Facebook about environmental pollution, bureaucratic stuff-ups, democracy issues, corporate greed, or the lack of interest in funding education, etc. From your usual platform, you can extend your discussion, updates and viewpoints to a current issue in need of political change, whether it's as huge as protests of dissent seeking a change of government, or as small but still as significant as a campaign to increase the level of resourcing of education or libraries in your local area.


Your interest in democracy, human rights, education, gender equality, nature, the environment, animal welfare, and so forth, can easily keep you informed of and up-to-date about the bigger issues at stake; staying in the flow regularly means that when a particular situation arises or the time has come for real change, you're at the forefront of understanding its import and the necessity to jump in and support the fervor. All the same, don't curtail yourself; provided you have the passion, you can channel your activism and your passion for change into all similar issues grounded on ensuring human dignity, equality for all, and consideration for nature and other species.
Look for a catalyst for political change. Is there something in the news recently that would cause many to demand change? It is often much easier to promote something once a catalyst has started the process in the first place, provided you're knowledgeable about it.

, People are motivated most by affirming visions that describe a better future than the one they're experiencing now. Paint what the future should look like rather than focusing purely on the negatives. By all means be clear about current problems and even consider using examples and photos that goad people into action but don't keep the message on negativity all the time. Amplify and describe to people the future possibilities.


Try using interactive tools to let people work out things for themselves, to give them a sense of ownership. For example, during the BP oil spill, an interactive map showing how the oil spill was projected to bloom across the ocean over time was tweeted around. This was more effective at concerning people than a whole lot of words. Perhaps use maps, historical timelines, or visual histories to help people better understand what is happening now and why. For example, showing a country's history of repression on a visual timeline might help people less familiar with the happenings grasp the concepts faster and with more accuracy than a whole lot of paragraphs detailing the same information.

Spread your message to as many of your social media contacts as possible.,
Know what information you can share.",How to Use Social Media to Spur Political Change5," An important element of sharing is also asking your contacts to forward on what you've shared. This is how the power of social media manifests its strength and it is important to encourage others to be agents of change with you. For example, you may ask them to ""RT"" or retweet your messages on Twitter. The ripple effect of sharing, where if everyone has ten contacts, one person will affect ten, ten hundred, hundred thousand, and thousand ten thousand, is the social media guarantee that when a cause or protest takes hold, and all those connected will hear the message and join in.


In return, always do the same for those sharing your message if they're also providing relevant and important information; share their information too.
Join with like-minded people and civil society organizations, and share their updates as well as your own.

, There are many things you can share when the cause or protest takes off but it will depend on what the issue is and whether you're targeting people who are supporting via social media or people who are actively pursuing political change on-the-ground. Some ideas of what you might wish to share include:


Background information as to what the cause is, what you believe needs changing and why
Information that people can verify if they ask questions or are asked questions
What is going on in your area in terms of government, corporate, institutional, or military action (including photos and video, if you can)
Tips on how people can protect themselves against riot control agents, arrest, or against search and seizure, etc.

Emergency numbers for use in case protesters are arrested; bail options and ways people online might be able to help raise bail if relevant
Blueprints of where to go and what supplies to take; whether it's a peaceful demonstration or a riotous protest, keeping people in the know is a way of helping them stay safe and informed
Messages of support and solidarity to boost protesters' morale
Tips for how to bypass government censorship or read between the lines of propaganda
Actions that can be taken by the average citizen not actually participating or not even in the same country, such as filling in petitions, writing to officials and committees, spreading information in their own communities, donating money, raising awareness via their own websites or workplaces, etc., and provision of pro forms or templates is often very helpful to guide people.

"
Avoid over-extending your own importance.",How to Use Social Media to Spur Political Change6," If you're not ""on-the-ground"" so to speak, be aware that you're not the frontline but that you do serve as a source of collaborative support. If the cause or protest you're actively promoting is one that involves violence, mayhem, and injury to people, such as during a political clash on the streets involving armies or police, and you're simply relaying the happenings, then you're certainly not experiencing the same hardships that those people on the ground are. Nevertheless, your moral support, your clear and continued collaboration to spread an outcry against the wrongs being committed against your fellow global citizens is a source of strength and solidarity with those who are at the frontline. Provided you remember your supportive and collaborative role in using social media, you'll be able to maintain the level of respect and concern for the dignity of people experiencing incredible hardships without coming across as cloying, condescending, or poorly informed.


See yourself as helping to empower others.
Be ready to apologize if you do cross the line and become over-zealous or misunderstand the issues. It can happen in the heat of the moment, in the power of the passion and given the nature of being fast online. Don't be arrogant – admit you overstepped the mark and get on with being a supporter or promoter again.
Don't retweet or share updates that you don't understand or fully engage with. Take the time to read everything relevant through thoroughly and ensure that it makes sense with you and aligns with your reasons for supporting the cause. In other words, don't just assume that things you've been copied in on are valid or worthy of redistribution without analyzing them first.

"
"
Have a base and its active counterpart in the real world too.",How to Use Social Media to Spur Political Change7," People like to connect and help things that are growing, and show results where they can point to. For example, if you are following a petition for ""more nature oriented"" or ""greenery"", try doing groundwork in your neighborhood as a role model and upload updates (photos, meetings, work done, and members) in the online format. This will not only engage you in your passion but also help the web community you are interested to attract; as your base grows you will have opportunity to use the web portal of social networking as a mouthpiece for collaboration and a meeting place for common ideas.

"
Be patient.,
Dream big, dream beyond borders.",How to Use Social Media to Spur Political Change8," It will take time to update yourself with emerging trends in online media as well as the new opinions and technologies and changes in the offline world, especially if you have patience to hear what new members have to say, they are a valuable source of what's happening around the world. However, it is this very process of gradual conversation with others around the world, with opening your mind to other viewpoints and understandings that will result in change according to Professor Clay Shirky.A large part of what you should be aiming to do is to create space for dialog, discussion, conversation, and brainstorming. Some changes will come faster than others, but the process of getting there is very important. Clay Shirky says that protest often comes at the end of all this careful groundwork, not as a replacement for it.Be reassured that a large part of what you're doing is creating that public space in which people can feel comfortable to interact and express their concerns and visions for a preferred future.


Understand that ""If You Write It, They Will Come""; especially if ""it"" is an idea who's time has come.

, The internet is incredible in its potential and its ability to sustain relationships; who would have thought of using social media for protest 10 years ago? We're at the beginning of using social networking as a means for reorienting our world and these are exciting times. So much so, that Professor of Philosophy Anthony Weston believes that our online social networking presence can create ""an alternative to the UN"" in which ongoing direct contact between people solves issues as citizens and civil society rather than through governments alone.He even envisions representative virtual districts, in which we our online presence is as persuasive as, if not more so, our geographical presence. If you think that's exciting, grasp that potential and be a part of helping to ensure that all voices are heard, no matter where our fellow human beings live.


Maintain virtual dialog with people all around the world; show interest and care about issues that impact people elsewhere. Ultimately, the global market, communications, transportation, environment, shared atmosphere, and shared values of humanity ensure that we're all interlinked anyway, so this is both altruistic and self-serving at once.
Given that a few revolutions and changes are already been attributed to social media, this means hope to people in other places in need of massive societal change. They are watching, listening, learning, and waiting their turn. For example, while Africans have huge issues of poverty to contend with, the mobile web has penetrated deeply throughout Africa, to the point where Kenyan blogger Brian Mungeli believes that 2011 is ""the year of the social media... will make more leaders aware of the power of social media and the highly unpredictable youth who dominate the platforms"".Rather than simply ""watching this space"", social media participants are influencing it too.

Make your profile picture something really interesting and make sure that the colors in both pictures go well together.


For example, get a nice black and white picture of yourself to use as a portrait and then a black and white, wide, narrow shot of you walking in a forest or doing an activity you enjoy to use for your cover image.

Always be upbeat or positive. You should be a person who is upbeat or positive. Constantly complaining about girls/boys, your family, or whatever else drives you crazy is just going to drive people away. They have enough of their own problems and they want to feel like even when someone has a hard time, they can find the upside in the situation.

, You want the content you post to be interesting. Don’t just post about the laundry sitting on your floor or whiny, passive-aggressive attempts to get attention. Instead, post funny stories, good jokes, awesome pictures, and interesting facts. Post things that are relevant or improve other people’s day, not something annoying and boring.


If you have a talent, use it! If you sing, draw, write, or have any other talent that you can show off, do that! Record videos or post pictures to get other people interested in the cool things you do.
You can also post content you like that you find on Tumblr, Reddit, Upworthy, and other popular sites, if you don't always have the time or ability to make your own.

Make your page public.,
Get lots of friends.,
Join communities and groups.,
Encourage interaction.,
Interact a lot.,
Time important or exciting posts carefully.",How to Become Famous on Facebook and Get a Lot of Likes2," If you want to get lots of friends on Facebook and get lots of people looking at your content, make your page a public page. This will really help make sure that more people see your stuff. Just remember: don’t post anything that’s going to come back to haunt you!

, Friend everyone you meet in real life, if possible. Friend everyone at school and try to friend your friends’ friends as well (now there’s a tongue twister). When someone you aren’t friends with comments or interacts with your posts, friend them. When you see someone on a fan page you think might like your page, friend them. The more friends you have, the more people will see and interact with your posts.


Friend even people that you don't know very well or only met once. No one is actually personal friends with 500+ people, so don't feel discourages when you see other famous Facebook users with huge friends lists.
Don't forget to friend people that you haven't seen in a really long time. Maybe those friendships will even be rekindled!

, Find a community that would like you and join it. Fan pages, groups, anything like that where you are the person to know because you are a great example of what that group of people find interesting. Groups and communities are great ways to meet people and make new friends outside of your immediate area, giving you a voice across the country and across the world!


Appealing to one group of people is going to be easier than trying to appeal to everyone. Find your niche and appeal to them.

, Your posts should make people want to comment like, or otherwise interact with you. Post questions, opinions on controversial topics, or inspiring quotes or stories. The more likes, shares, and comments you get, the more Facebook will make sure that people see your posts.


Example posts would look like: ""I'm no policy adviser, but the US is handling this Syria business all wrong. What do you guys think?"" or ""Macklemore concert next month...wish I could go so bad! Who's with me?"" or ""“I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.”-Marilyn Monroe"".

, Interact with other people a lot. This will make them feel like they know you and will also give you the chance to meet new friends. Comment on their status updates and pictures, leave birthday messages, and find other ways to interact with everyone you’re friends with on Facebook.

, When you’re posting something that you really want people to see, make sure you time it well. Saturday mornings and weekday evenings are when the greatest number of people are checking their feed!

"
"
Use Twitter and Instagram too.,
Pair your Facebook with a blog.,
Advertise yourself on other websites.",How to Become Famous on Facebook and Get a Lot of Likes3," Post stuff on twitter and Instagram to make sure even more people get to see your content. Make sure that there is a link to your Facebook so that they can find you and friend you there for even more content and posts. Try not to overlap the content too much: you want people to feel like they have a reason to follow you on every network, not just one!

, To give people even more of a connection to you, have a blog. This can be on Facebook but keeping it on a separate site would be better, since it will help increase your audience. Make sure your blog content is just as interesting and personal, so that people are invested in the things you write down. Have a link to your Facebook and encourage people to friend you there.

, If you do have a blog, find ways to advertise your blog elsewhere to draw in even more people. Find communities which are interested in the kind of content you post and comment, telling them to friend you to find all sorts of cool new stuff.

, This title should reflect the kind of content you plan on posting to this board.

, Doing so will create your Pinterest board. Now that you have a place to store content, you're ready to upload and save some pins.


You can also hide your board from other Pinterest users by selecting the Keep board secret switch (called Secret on desktop).

, This applies to desktop as well (you'll find it in the bottom-right corner of the page). You should see a couple of options appear:



Photo (mobile)/Upload a Pin (desktop) - Allows you to select a photo from your device's default ""Pictures"" album.

Website (mobile)/Save from a website (desktop) - Lets you search for a website (or enter a link to one), then search the resulting site for pin-compatible items.
On mobile, you also have the option of tapping Copied Link to navigate to the last link you copied. This option is functionally the same as tapping Website.

, From here, uploading a pin will vary based on your choice:


If you chose to upload a photo, you'll have to allow Pinterest access to your device (mobile) or click Choose photos (desktop). You can then browse through your device's pictures to select the one you wish to upload.
If you chose to use a website, you'll enter the website's URL into the provided text field. Once the site finishes loading, you should see a list of all media that you can pin--though, on iPhone, you must first tap Save in the top-right corner before you see this list.

, Again, this process will vary slightly depending on your chosen upload path, but you'll tap or click the photo you wish to save.

, Doing so will add your pin to the board in question.


You can also add a description to your item in the field to the right of the item's icon.

, Remember, it's a magnifying glass on mobile, and a ""Search"" bar at the top of the page on desktop.

, You can do this by typing a search query into the search bar, or you can simply return to the Home page to view Pinterest's suggestions.

, Doing so will open it.

, This option is in the top-right corner of pinned items on iPhone and desktop, and in the bottom-right corner of items on Android.

, Doing so will add your pin to the board in question.


As with uploaded pins, you can also add a description to your item in the field to the right of the item's icon.

, You can use keywords or more specific search terms to find boards and people to follow.

, For example, if you want to follow a board that posts pictures of kittens, you might type ""kittens"" into the search bar.

, You don't need to do this on desktop, since the ""Filter"" options are in the second row of tabs below the search bar.

, You'll select Boards to show only boards displaying your search term, or People to find Pinterest users to follow.


On Android, tap Pinners to filter based on people.

, This option is below a board or person. Doing so will cause you to follow the board or person in question.

Many times people tend to look for one version of the item and when that's not found, they tend to look for the other, and when both have been exhausted, tend to type it in another way, to make sure. If it's still not found, you'll have to request a new gas station be entered at the address.

Join an affiliate program network (Clickbank or Commission Junction). Affiliate programs are when you will advertise a product for a specific seller. Every person that is forwarded to the seller’s website through your advertising, you will make a percentage of the profit, it’s that simple. The seller will provide you specifically coded links that you can post anywhere on the internet, and these links will refer back to your program every time someone uses them. On your blog you can have PPC ads which generate revenue for you. After a while, it’s money straight into your pocket.;
, This is where Myspace comes in. With Myspace, you can use bulletins, messages, or comments to post these links, but you have to do so carefully and discretely. You don’t want it to look like spam. So you need to create a good profile on Myspace that looks attractive.

, With a large friend list, you can reach all of your friends with the push of a button. This is where it can become tedious and boring.

, Now, here's where it can get tricky. You don’t want to make the bulletins seem like huge advertisements. So one method some use is to make up an interesting story that will make other Myspacers want to follow your link. Sometimes, it's even a good idea to create a landing page with some non-advertising information on it, and stick your affiliate link on that page. It might save you from being flagged for spam.

, If one type of bulletin is not working, try changing it around, or changing your landing page.

Be humorous.,
Show your expertise.,
Connect people.,
Be helpful.,
Be a humorous troll.",How to Become Popular on Twitter in India," The road most travelled, most of the folks who join Twitter try this route. There’s nothing bad in being humorous, but you must be original if you really want that huge fan base at your command, otherwise you will be flamed for plagiarizing tweets. The viral nature of Twitter is your best friend here; if you really have it in you to make people split up in laughter, then there’s no stopping you. And you need not worry about the subject of your jokes at all, as there’s always something or someone to poke fun at on Twitter. In short: Be funny. Be original. Be different.


On any given day, there will be at least one hashtag where you can join in and show your funny side. You could engage in some playful banter with those who are participating in that hashtag. The more you communicate with people, the more you get noticed.
Also, having your own brand of humor works really well. While Ramesh Srivats and Avinash Lyer are famous for their puns, the Pagal Patrakar comes up with his own take on breaking faking news. And who can forget the inimitable Fake Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and his I-Am-God egotistical style of humor?;
, What are you an expert on? Is there any topic where you have a strong foothold? Is it politics? Marketing? Cricket? Music? Knitting? Be it any topic, you will find thousands of folks who share the same interest as you do.


A simple search on followerwonk.com using your industry keywords will help you find all those people who are just like you. You will see them creating and sharing content that is relevant to your niche. Now all you need to do is to strike up a conversation with them and let your ability shine through.
Connecting with influencers from your niche will speed up the growth of your audience. But the bottom line is, if you are genuinely an expert on something, you are bound to get noticed by your colleagues and competitors if you network effectively.

, On Twitter, every day someone is out there looking to connect with a person who can be of some help. Not a single goes by where you don’t see people looking for PG accommodations, designers, developers, blood donors, dog adopters, and so forth. A connector is someone who is highly networked and knows people from most (if not all) walks of life. He or she is up-to-date with all the info about the folks he or she is connected with and helps them find each other. Apart from getting noticed, connecting two people who are in desperate need of each other also generates that holy goodwill that will give you the best seat in heaven.


For example: The original author found a lady who urgently wanted to talk with employees from a certain IT company. The author stumbled across her tweet through an RT and immediately connected her with 6-7 employees of that particular company, one being the COO. Result? Goodwill aside, the author is now connected to an influencer and a senior executive from that IT company.
Another connector is Social Samosa’s very own Ankita Gaba.

, This is something that very few people do on Twitter. And it shocks me as to how people who want to build a meaningful network around them are so lazy when it comes to helping others. Social media is all about giving and sharing (no, this is not about sharing links to your blog post here). The more you give, the more your receive. Someone is looking for guitar tutorials? Do an online search to find the best guitar tutorial out there. Of course, it might take some of your time but who said everything in life’s easy? The time and effort you spend helping people will one day prove immensely fruitful to you. However, the true essence of helping lies in not expecting something back in return.


Note: Always a keep a tab on the #help hashtag, a lot of people ask for help using it.

, Can’t crack jokes? Don’t have time to connect people? Not an expert in anything? Too lazy to help others? No problemo, amigos y amigas! Twitter is also the place where all the haters meet and have fun trolling their least favorite celeb. Just go out there and start trashing that one famous personality whom you hate more than mathematics. You will be surprised to find that your views are echoed by a thousand others. The perfect examples of trolls-who-got-famous are Satan Bhagat (who is a big time Chetan Bhagat basher) and Bollywood Gandu (trolling the entire Bollywood). And they aren’t famous for trolling alone. They have fused trolling with their own brand of humor and look how famous they are now!

Use the right tone when tweeting.,
Show your appreciation.,
Retweet your idol's tweets.,
Know what your idol likes.,
Wait for the right time.",How to Be Noticed by Your Idol on Twitter1," Your own Twitter account and tweets will likely play a big part in getting a reply from your idol. Depending on who your idol is, they may or may not appreciate certain tone, language, or other elements of your tweets. Try to use language that you think your idol will most enjoy.For example, a profanity loaded tweet sent to Martha Stewart is highly unlikely to be noticed.
On the other hand, tweeting your favorite comedian a rude joke might be appreciated.
Always customize your tone to match the interests and image of your idol.;
, Letting your idol know how they have helped you in your own life can make them more likely to respond. You might try letting them know about something they did or said that you found meaningful and helpful. Share how your idols actions and words have had an impact on your life to increase the chances that they will respond.


For example, your idol might have inspired you to create some art or music.
Maybe something your idol said got your through a difficult time.

, Retweeting your idol's tweets can be a great way to show how much your enjoy their content and will help to support them. If you find a tweet from your idol that you enjoy, try to retweet it. Having a history of retweeting your idol's tweets can increase the chances that they will respond to one of your own tweets.Try not to retweet everything as your own followers may not share the same appreciation of your idol.

, Your goal will be to catch the attention of your idol. A great way to do this is to do some research into their own personal interests. Take some time and find out some things that your idol loves and try building your tweets around those interests. By including personally interesting content for your celebrity to read you will increase your chances of being noticed.For example, your idol might love video games. Posting something about gaming might help get their attention.
Try to make your tweets in-line with whatever image your idol is presenting.

, A large part of getting noticed by your idol on Twitter is timing. If you tweet too long after your idol does there is a lower chance of them seeing it. You will need to reply to your idol's tweets as soon as they are posted. Doing so will get your tweet higher up in the time-line and more noticeable.Keep an eye on your idols account to see when they are online.
Watch for new tweets and reply as soon as you can.
You can set your Twitter app to send you push notifications whenever your idol tweets. This will allow you to respond instantly without being glued to your Twitter feed.

Customize your bio to let people know what you are looking for and add video, links to a blog and other media to encourage them to connect with you.;
, These are people who share tweets about your topic, post links to articles and blogs, etc. They will be a good source for information. Use topical search tools, such as Twellow to locate them. Retweet a few of their posts and become a follower before approaching them to share your content.

, Twitter is a very limited format, so using it to post links to a blog is sometimes more effective than trying to break your whole message into bite sized chunks. Images and links to social media sites can also be shared. Create enough content, to tell the story of what you are about, what your product or cause is, or what you want your followers to do.

, Schedule at least the first week's worth of content. From your blog, or other platforms, create links to tweet. Schedule your posts so that your content comes in the right order. You can tweet several times a day, even the same content to get attention.

, This group will hopefully be fans of your content! Many of them will follow back. the more you find to connect with, the more followers you will have. Invite them to experience your content by using @ mentions and sharing links. Example @(twitter handle of person you want to reach) have you read this article yet? (include the link)

, These are broadcasters. Work to build relationship with them, they will help to spread your content further than you can alone! Be sure to return the favor by sharing things they tweet with your followers.

Avoid spamming.,
Don't use guilt.,
Avoid seeking negative attention.,
Make sure your idol actually uses twitter.",How to Be Noticed by Your Idol on Twitter2," Messaging, tweeting, or retweeting too often can actually hurt your efforts when trying to get noticed by your idol on Twitter. If you are too active with your tweets it will likely be perceived as spam and will be ignored. Try to avoid tweeting or retweeting too often and always make sure you are saying something of value or interest.Don't send the same tweets again and again.
Try not to tweet so often that it becomes spam.
You can tweet frequently but always keep your tweets engaging and include quality content.

, When some people are trying to get attention from their idol on Twitter they may resort to using guilt. These messages are aimed at making the celebrity feel bad about not responding. However, these tweets will usually be ignored. Always avoid trying to guilt your idol into replying as this will lower your chances of getting noticed.Saying something like “I guess my idol doesn't care about me” is not a good idea.

, Don't fall into the trap of thinking that any attention is better than none. When you are trying to get noticed by your idol always avoid seeking a negative response from them. Although you might get noticed, the interaction will be a poor one and will lower the chances of you getting noticed in the future.Never try to get a response by insulting something your idol has done.
Avoid saying anything drastic such as threatening suicide if they don't respond.

, Do some research on your idol and their Twitter account. Not every celebrity actually manages or uses their own Twitter account, having hired other people to manage it for them. Other celebrities may handle their own account but might not reply to their followers or may not reply often. Try to find idols that are active on Twitter, manage their own accounts, and reply to followers often to increase your chances of getting noticed.

Think about your Twitter name.,

Use hashtags.",How to Be Noticed by Your Idol on Twitter3," The name you are using to Tweet with can have an impact on how likely it is to get noticed. By taking your Twitter name into account you can pick one that has a better chance of getting your Tweets noticed by your idol.Avoid generic names with lot's of numbers or names that are too close to ones other fans use. These names are too easy to skip over and don't stand out. For example, “belieber4758” is not a good name to use.
Depending on your idol's tastes, you might want to avoid using any vulgar or rude user names.

Get to know the language and abbreviations commonly used on Twitter.",How to Be a Successful Twitter Fan Account," Make sure to only choose one fandom; you don't want to be not loyal. Some popular Twitter fandoms consist of popular musicians, YouTubers, TV shows, or celebrities that are well-known and liked by young teenagers.;
, Make a clever username that will make people want to follow and interact with you. Try to keep numbers and underscores out of your username and try not to use capital letters as it makes your account looks gross. Make sure the username corresponds to your fandom. Some clever usernames can include pretty & meaningful words along with your idol's first name, last name or initials .

, Making your bio appealing will draw in followers. You may think putting all kinds of fancy fonts in your bio will make it look cooler, but it will just make your bio look messy and unprofessional. Avoid fonts at all costs. Go with something simple; an inspirational quote or song lyric is best but don't make your bio too long.

, Make sure your Twitter header and icon match. There are many apps that you can use to create matching layouts like Superimpose & PicsArt for common pixel/ 8bit layouts. But, if you are not very good at matching layouts, go with a simple single shade of black and white or sepia for both.

, Don't be inactive, but don't tweet every 2 seconds. Your followers don't want their timelines full of only your tweets. Unless your favorite celebrity is doing a follow or tweet spree, you should only be tweeting up to 50-200 times a day. That may seem like a lot, but when you're really into Twitter, it will get hard to keep within this limit.

, Remember, followers don't matter if they never talk to you. If you have over 10,000 followers, you should at least get anywhere from 10-100 favorites and/or 1-11 retweets minimum on most of your tweets. You do not need to interact with all of your followers, but become good friends with at least a few of them by having close mutuals (people who you follow and they follow you back) and or being in lots of group chats .

What if I don't reach 50 followers in 2 weeks?,
But your Home page is now spammed by all the tweets of the random users you followed...,
That's it!",How to Be Successful on Twitter," Choose a good profile pic and a banner and make your bio relevant to what you will tweet about. Make your username something that you tweet about, or that interests many people (ex. @SportsNewsForYou). ALWAYS make your name your in real life name. This will help you in 2 ways: 1 people you know can look you up and find you. 2 Other tweeters prefer to follow people that are honest, even to a Social Network.;
, Search for people you admire. An author, an athlete or even an actor are great people to follow if your interested in them. Then, when your following at least 50 people, go on ""Discover"" and look at people who post there. Are their tweets interesting? If yes, follow them! After your following a lot of people start Tweeting (yes, tweet AFTER you follow).

, Tweet about your life, or someone else's life, or just tweet about anything that comes to mind (ex. TGIF on Fridays)! If you get more than 50 followers in 2 weeks, your awesome! Try to tweet regularly (set yourself a time(s) of day when your going to tweet) and in tweets, use Hashtags! Hashtags are like a Title to your tweet (but it goes at the end): for example, if its Friday and your tweeting something a long the lines of ""I love Friday's :D"", add at the end #TGIF. People will understand at one glance what your tweet is about and people can search for your tweet by your hashtag. Also, sometimes look at ""Trends"" and try to tweet something with a hashtag found in trends, this will make your tweet a bit more popular.

, If someone tweets about something you can relate to, or that you find amusing and could interest your followers, retweet it! Retweeting is basically showing that tweet on your profile so that all your followers can see it.

, If you don't reach that goal, don't worry: not many Twitter accounts grow that much that quickly. That's why so many people have created FollowBackTrains; their basically a tweet that says something like ""Retweet this and follow everyone who retweeted for many followers!"". If a big account tweets this (big=over 10k followers), it WILL get many retweets and you gotta be in the first 30 to retweet it, because many people will then follow you. If your like 100th, no one will bother to follow all those people and you'll get no advantage. Search #TeamFollowBack and find a user that often tweets these kind of FollowBackTrains. Follow him and try to retweet these tweets as quickly as possible. Yes, your account will have no good tweets, but you'll get like 400 followers in no time! (took me like 3 days :D). Set yourself a certain amount of followers (500), and when you reach that you will have to STOP doing the follow trains and start tweeting meaningful stuff. Since your account has hundreds of followers, more people will be interested in what you tweet and if your tweets are good, you'll get many more followers!

, This is a very negative side of participating to FollowBackTrains: you don't know who your following and you find your Homepage full of tweets that have no meaning to you. How to fix this? Set yourself another goal (like 700 followers), and when you reach that with GENUINE tweets, it means that people like what you tweet about and they won't unfollow you if you keep your tweeting-style the same. Go on www.manageflitter.com and sign in with your Twitter (it's safe, it won't be able to do anything on Direct Messages and it will never post tweets for you without your approving). Go to: Unfollow->Not following back and unfollow everyone that isn't following you back (unless you chose to follow them before the FollowBackTrains). Then unfollow some other people (ManageFlitter) free has categories like ""Not following back"", ""No profile pic"" or ""Non-English"" and you can choose who to unfollow, even if their following you. After this transaction your followers WILL drop a bit, but those left will be people who actually want to follow you.

, This method works pretty well and will get you around 500-1000 followers in no time! Happy Tweeting!

Configure the auto responder to suit your needs.,
Search for a link shortener.,
Test the auto responder yourself.",How to Auto Respond on Twitter," Open up your web browser and search for something like, “Twitter Auto Direct Message” or “Twitter Auto Responder.”


There are several options for you to choose. autodmer.com is a simple option that has been working for a long time, and is free to use.
You can give a multitude of applications access to your Twitter, which can really increase both the social and marketing aspects of the social network.
At this time, Twitter does not provide you with an option to auto respond. You must authorize an outside application to do the job.;
, You will be asked to sign in to Twitter by providing your account and password credentials.


The application will tell you what specific aspects of your Twitter account it will have access to.
An auto responder/direct messaging application will not have access to your password.
If you change your mind and want to revoke access from an application you can do so through your Twitter settings. All you need is to go to Twitter, then go to Settings and then Apps.

, These applications are usually very straight forward. The most important part will be coming up with a short and concise Direct Message.


Twitter removed the 140 character limit from Direct Messages in August 2015. However, you don’t want to overwhelm a new follower with a wall of text that will likey go unread.
You’re going to want to greet people first, so that you don’t sound robotic. Be polite. This is your first impression.
Create a call to action to market yourself, but don’t be overly aggressive. If you’re polite in your presentation, people will be tempted to check out what you have to offer.
You can market anything you want ranging from your personal or business website, a blog, or another social media account.

, You can do this by going to Google and searching for “URL shortener.” A URL shortener will give you a new URL that is shorter than the original so you can save characters on Twitter.


Simply copy and paste a full URL into the Shortener. You will be given a shorter link, which still points to your website. Copy this link and use it in your auto tweet.
It is tough to both make a proper salutation and market yourself politely without writing far more than is necessary. A URL shortener will help you keep the clutter to a minimum so that a new follower actually reads what you have to say.

, You can do this by either having a second account or by having a friend unfollow and then follow you again. This will allow you to see what your auto tweet looks like, so that you can decide if you like it or not.

The documents protect both the makers and the Twitter users. The document contains the discouragement of the improper use of Twitter and other inappropriate contents like violence. Furthermore, the document forbids the underage use of the application and it also provides other basic violation.;
, Twitter has become the milieu of people for their thoughts and opinions. People nowadays use social media such as Twitter as an avenue to bully and undermine other people. Remember to be cautious with your use of words and be aware that what you say in person is different when it is in social media because of its lack of context.  You and other Twitter users have different cultural backgrounds thus you are exposed to a spectrum of different perspectives. Imagine putting yourself in the shoes of others. Ultimately, think before you click.

, People talk a lot about their Freedom of Expression, their right to express their opinions freely without hindrances but we barely talk about Social Responsibility. Social responsibility is a duty every individual has to perform so as to maintain a balance between the economy and the ecosystems, in other words we have to understand that whatever we post online has a corresponding effect to our followers and whoever we are talking to. Twitter is not an avenue for you to rant and rant and rant so as other social networking sites. We need to remember that the millions of users around the world can see whatever you post online, especially when you have a public profile.

, Twitter is the pioneer medium in introducing and popularizing the use of # (hashtags) wherein its purpose was to consolidate and unify users who talk a particular topic under the said hashtag. But because of the multitude of Twitter users, the real purpose of hashtag was forgotten. Remember, never bombard your tweets with hashtags that does not even relate to your tweet. Not all your tweets are in need of hashtags. At the same time do not confuse a hashtag with a tweet. You can tweet a hashtag, but never hashtag your tweets. #IYKWIM

, You are able to engage and interact with people from different backgrounds and cultures from around the world on Twitter, you can make friends and even find the love of your life, all of these just by clicking the follow button. But also, you can make false relationships, be used and be fooled. For example, people can use your profile information to be able to use your identity. People can also use this connection into deceiving you into information without accuracy.   Be mindful to know the person who you are following and who you want to follow before clicking that follow button.

, Always remember that Twitter is social media. And always give emphasis on the word “social” thus social media users such as those in Twitter should possess proper social etiquette. Before you post anything, always remember that you should be tactful. It is okay to shout out your feelings and grudges in Twitter but put in the right context and at the right time. Never also forget that your words define your personality in social media, so your tweets, per se, are ugly and tacky it’s like covering yourself in something tacky as well in a very wide social setting. Also, avoid making Twitter as your daily diary. It is okay to tweets something for a number of times but filter very personal information.

Be patient.",How to Make a Viral Kitten Video," People can spot the person lacking passion for their subject matter a million pixels away, so be sure that your venture into kitten fame is one filled with your own good intentions and love for cats. Preferably you'll be someone who is already known for championing the cause of feline love and adoration in the online sphere as well as in real life. If you've already got online connections who know how cat-crazy you are, this provides for a purr-fect start to your endeavor.


Know your kitten. However long you've spent with your kitten, you're bound to know her personal traits already and those are something that you're in the best position to focus on. If you don't know enough yet, spend some time just watching her and learning from her habits so that you know what makes her look her cutest, most interesting, etc.;
, If you're trying to make a viral video just because you want to–be famous; get more subscribers; sell more widgets, etc.––then you're missing the point of it all. Viral videos work because people are treated with respect and you're aiming to connect with them by sharing something that is authentic, genuine and really tugs the heartstrings. Anything that has an ulterior motive will be spotted. So, bear in mind that your kitten video needs to reflect both your love and adoration for all things feline and your respect for your viewers and a desire to excite your viewers' interest.


Having an affinity for your viewing community also involves knowing how to make a decent video. Videos with noise (distorted picture), bad sound, poor angles and fuzziness aren't likely to become viral unless what's on it is so compelling that the video quality is kindly overlooked. Do your viewers a big favor and use good quality filming equipment.

, What about these videos makes them so attractive to viewers? This varies between videos and it can be a combination of factors or it might be just one thing that the kitten does. Do an online search along the lines of ""top kitten videos"" or ""top viral kitten videos"", etc. and spend some time checking out what other people have done to get successful kitten or cat videos shared around. And here are some things that make these videos so popular:



Just plain cute. It's really hard to go past a video of a mother cat hugging her kitten or a kitten totally absorbed by something that really excites her.

Funny. Humor is an important element of viral communications because people want to feel uplifted and excited by what they're seeing. (Note: if the humor is at the expense of the cat, it is never harmful or demeaning––such a video wouldn't be appreciated or sent virally.)

Clean (just like cats). This means they can be emailed around the workplace and usually shared with the kids too. A few curse words now and then in print don't seem to affect the viral nature but they're certainly not necessary to create the humor.

Objects are involved. Such things as the cat or kitten playing with a ball/toy/household item, playing an instrument (pianos seem popular), moving game pieces, looking as if they're using something a human would use such as kitchen utensils or tools, etc.

Things cats don't like. Like water––this is a very popular theme! And it's even more interesting when the cat proves that it does like something people think cats aren't supposed to like, such as a cat enjoying water, or cooperating with a dog.

Surprise: The element of surprise can often catch a cat reacting in a really fun and amusing way, such as when you pounce on her around a corner or throw a toy at her when she's totally unsuspecting. These make for great ""set-up"" opportunities (see below).

Antics of a cat watching the TV or computer screen. For some reason, viewers never tire of watching how a cat responds to the things we just sit back and veg out over! A fish tank can also provide fascinating cat watching viewing. And cats interrupting their owners trying to use technology is a very popular theme, such as the cat snoozing on the laptop, trying to play the video game or trying to type.

How noisy a cat can be. Think the world's loudest purring cat, the world's loudest water-slurping cat, the world's loudest meow, etc. and you're onto something.

A cat doing something that comes naturally to the cat but looks absolutely hilarious to us. This might be catching a toy, fetching a piece of paper, scratching away, running like a ""scaredy cat"", pouncing or staring. For example, the ""OMG WTF"" cat that just stares at the camera for a full 20 seconds.A cat's eating habits. These can be amusing, depending on what is being eaten, where and even from what container (such as getting cat biscuits out of theme park-like feeding bowls).

Another species is involved. Some of the cutest kitten or cat videos involve puppies, dogs, horses, ducklings and other species of animals interacting gently and affectionately with the cat or kitten. If you have this opportunity and you film it well, you're probably sitting on a gold mine of ""virality"". (And all the better if you manage to show the kitten putting a feisty dog in its place!)

Entire episodes of a cat story. Some people even go to a great deal of trouble to make an entire story out of their cat's nine lives and create a cult following. Often it will be one of the videos in this lot that goes viral and wins the creator a dedicated following thereafter.

, Your kitten is going do whatever she feels like; after all, she's not aware that your video camera means that she needs to perform in some way. The discovery of great poses, movements, action sequences and cute moments is going to be all down to your attentiveness to your subject and having a total readiness to grab the video camera at any time when your kitten does things that you know are going to make great film. Playtime is a always a good time to have the video camera ready but so are other times when your kitten is around you in the house, such as when you're watching TV, playing video games, relaxing in the hammock, cleaning the house, making a meal, etc. Your kitten will be interested in all sorts of activities in the house, and any one of these could be ""just that moment"" to capture on film forever.


If other members of the household are keen to help out, fill them in on being ready to film the kitten any time she looks like she's doing something film-worthy. That way, you get more opportunities to capture her antics on film and perhaps even edit them into a funnier sequence of your kitten's day-at-play.

, As well as being ready to capture your kitten on film any moment, set up moments as much as possible. A kitten is naturally extremely playful and this can work right into your needs. Use toys, balls, scrunched up paper or foil and other goodies in the house to throw her way, roll at her, tease her with, etc. and have the video rolling all the time (you can edit it later). It's even better if you have a helper who can either entice the kitten into playing or hold the video camera. A team approach is likely to result in a much better video and makes it easier to set up action sequences with a keen kitten.


It's important to be patient as your kitten may end up doing something really entertaining for some time. Have a steady hand with the video camera and try to keep alert to the fact that you're filming even though you're also thoroughly enjoying watching your kitten's antics. Keep in mind that the viewer wants to see the kitten at the center of the action, otherwise it can easy to accidentally lower or skew the angle of the camera.
Can your kitten sit still long enough to play a game? If she likes games, especially one that interacts with you, this could make for great video footage. One great example is that of the ""gambling"" cat who plays with the owner's mixed about walnut shells and still guesses where the hidden item is under the shell.Something like that can really engage viewers. Games of skill would probably be best suited to an older kitten.
Consider combining something super popular with your kitten. For example, have you got a video of Lady Gaga strutting her stuff? Think how cool it'd be if your kitten tried to join in dancing with Lady Gaga on the screen behind her or perhaps she might jump up and attack Lady Gaga with her wee paws. Whatever way you work in someone famous or something popular, this gives you an incredible angle with both the title for your video and the search keywords!

, Your kitten may be cute but that dirty carpet, shabby sofa and screaming child in the background won't do the video any favors as a whole. Either use editing to fix anything unsightly (or noisy) or only film in parts of your home or garden where the video is picking up clean, neat, pretty and viewer-considerate background and noises.


Viewers want to see your kitten, not shadows, thumbs, elbows or a flash of a kitten. Always be conscious that the lighting, angles and camera movements are going to result in quality, smooth videos.
Most of the time, unless you're visually amazing (and interesting) for some reason or other, keeping yourself out of the video and focusing purely on the kitten is the best idea. Keep the kitten central to the video.
If your house is a pigsty, vlogging is a great excuse to get it cleaned up. It's also better for your kitten to live in an uncluttered environment.

, Editing doesn't necessarily mean adding dialog or other snippets of info, nor does it mean making an entire show out of the kitten video––unless you want to do these things by way of enhancements. It does mean making sure that the video is interesting and the slow and less interesting parts have been kept to a minimum or removed and any fuzziness or other quality problems such as bad sound have been sorted before uploading the video.


Think outside the square. What added value can you provide your audience beyond the kitten? While the kitten's antics alone may be enough to make the video viral, sometimes adding elements such as speech timed to the kitten's mouth movements, speech bubbles reflecting the kitten's thoughts, music, introduced cartoon characters that interact with the kitten, etc. can all add more to the video's interest. Of course, while being creative is fun, it should also be viewable, so run your changes past some friends to be sure they like or ""get"" what you've done before unleashing it on the world.
Adding popular music to the background might increase interest but be aware of copyright laws in your jurisdiction or you may find the video is removed, leaving you entangled in a loss of viewers and disappointing viewers who visit your link. A lot of free music is available but be discerning because a lot of it isn't very good at all. And bear in mind that if the kitten video is good enough on its own, then music will simply be a distraction.
Keep it short and sweet. The longer the video, the more likely it is you're including portions where the kitten started wandering off or just stared into space and your viewers only want to see what is action paced or mega cute.
Beware shots of the backside. The kitten wandering off with her backside to the camera isn't the best looking angle; change angles or edit out the kitten rear shots.

, YouTube is one obvious place to put your video but there are other video channels too that are worth adding the video to, such as Google Video, Metacafe, Veoh.com. etc. The idea is really, the more the better, to increase your potential for exposure to as many viewers as possible. Also consider adding the video to your blog, website or other form of internet social networking opportunity that you already use and maintain. It is important that you stay around to answer all comments (and vet any trolling ones), so that people know you're receptive. And don't forget to use Facebook and Twitter as the place to encourage people to view the video; your followers and friends will be glad to help spread your video through these social networking sites if they enjoy it.


Use tags, lots of search-friendly keywords and other relevant ways to help people searching find your kitten video. If the site allows both tags and keywords, make the most of them. Don't just write ""kitten"". Also add in the elements that make your kitten video so special, such as ""attack kitten"", ""kitten licking ice cream"", ""cute kitten"", etc., whatever describes the actions or elements that define your content.
Use a catchy title to get viewers' interest aroused. Find something that really will draw in a viewer; if you can't think of a good title, ask your friends to make some suggestions, such as ""giant leap for tiny cat"" or ""kitten defies toilet flushing hedgehog"".
Email is still a great means for sending around viral videos, either by embedding the video into the email or adding the URL for clicking on. Just be sure it's sent to people you know will appreciate it though.

, You might need to make lots of kitten videos before you hit the sweet one that almost every viewer clicks with. Until that point, keep adding your videos featuring kittens and slowly building up subscribers to your blog, channel or whatever else you're creating so that people know your work and can critique and share it. Understand that all constructive criticism should be welcomed because your viewers are telling you––free of charge––what you need to do to improve the videos they're watching on their time for you. Setting aside blatant abuse and trolling comments, be sure to take on board constructive comments that will help you to refine the kitten videos you're sharing with everyone. All those refinements are actually tweaks to greater alignment with what the audience is looking for and ultimately, you'll provide what the audience is looking for and they'll be wowed by it.


Most viral videos go viral as an accident––having the intention to make a viral video is great but be realistic about its chances. It just might not happen and sometimes, the harder you try, the less likely the outcome. Viral videos need to be authentic, in-the-moment, amazing experiences that reach out and touch the viewer in a way that they didn't expect or have been so uplifted by that they can't help but share it with others. Do your best, be genuine and enjoy the process rather than sweating it. If it happens, it happens; if not, at least you're having fun!

Post statements you’d feel comfortable sharing with your boss or clients in person.,
Never comment about work online.,
Be grammatically unimpeachable.,
Post photos of yourself that you consider to be professional.,
Share links or other friend’s information that may be considered to be universally acceptable.,
Hide friend’s comments or information that is deemed to be inappropriate.,
Only link, follow or friend people you know and trust.",How to Behave Professionally on Social Media," Before you make any comment or post, consider how you’d feel if your boss or clients read what you’ve authored.


Never use foul language or curse words. One of the fastest ways to diminish your credibility is to curse or use derogatory language online. Re-read each comment or post to ensure it is not offensive or contains offensive language. Even innuendos may be enough to cause people to think twice about your character, so take care.
Avoid sharing emotionally, religiously or politically charged statements. If you wouldn't do this in the workplace, don't do it online either. Don’t make statements that could offend or turn off other people. Steer clear of getting on your soap box about political candidates, religions or starting emotionally charged arguments or heated discussions. All of this can lead to disappointment down the career track.;
, Whining or complaining about work on social media is akin to announcing that you're not a professional. On the other hand, if you brag about an accomplishment or brashly talk about landing certain clients you’ll appear arrogant and there is a risk that your bravado will distress coworkers who think you're stealing all the glory or annoy clients who want things to stay low key. The only cases where talking about work online is acceptable is to perhaps congratulate a colleague or client for an accomplishment, or to express how much you enjoy your work without a specific deal or win being mentioned.

, Double check your statements for typos. Before you post, edit your comments. If you want to be taken seriously, make sure everything you write is grammatically correct and void of typos.

, Photos of you showing your abs, cleavage, drunken evenings with friends or making obscene gestures to the camera should not be posted. Ever.


Carefully select your profile picture. Select from pictures of you participating in a sporting event, at a fun family gathering or a simple portrait would be acceptable. Profile pictures to avoid including wild party pictures or photos of you in a bathing suit or a skimpy outfit (even if you have a banging body). If you must post these, keep them very private and only allow close friends access.
Be mindful when posting any photo. Any photos posted by you should be clean and “G” rated, no matter where it is in your profile. Delete inappropriate photos or don’t post photos displaying sexually charged situations or where alcohol or drugs are involved.
UN-tag yourself if you’ve been tagged in unprofessional photos. You may not have control over what your friends post, but you can UN-tag yourself in photos so your network won't be able to view the photo. You can also consider asking friends to delete the photo if it’s particularly embarrassing.

, Remain neutral or uncontroversial by not posting links or liking pages that might be considered to be questionable or inappropriate. Be aware that you are as liable as the original poster for liking or passing on defamatory or other legally dubious statements, photos or content.


Don’t “like” controversial characters or celebrities. Pages such as mainstream news sources or links to globally acceptable activities such as sports, home and garden, autos, children or pets should be fine. However, liking political candidates, religious groups, certain musical groups, controversial movies and television shows may tarnish your reputation with certain people. It all depends on the kind of work circles you move in and how conservative a career trajectory you're following––you'll know whether or not this advice resonates with the choices you've made for your career.
If you post news and information on your page or on a friend’s page, make sure it is not showing bias. Examples of acceptable links include sharing a popular, upbeat news story, sports news or tips on home and gardening. The less controversial and more homely, bland and lacking in politicized/opinionated agendas, the safer you are with sharing it. Again, the extent of sanitization of your information will depend on the career path you've chosen.

, Remaining professional online means that you don’t want to associate with people who post inappropriate comments on your page.


Steer clear of angry or controversial conversations. If a friend or colleague posts something angry or emotionally charged on your page, delete the comment and call the friend or send him or her a private message. Also, if a friend is fighting with someone on a social media channel never participate or add a comment. This is simply good etiquette, to avoid adding fuel to the flames.
Private message friends who consistently post inappropriate information or comments on your wall. Ask the friend to stop using certain language or talking about particular topics on your wall.
Unfriend or hide all posts from friends who cannot abide to your wishes. If a friend begins to take up too much time because you constantly have to monitor his or her behavior on your page, you may need to unfriend this person.

, Only associate yourself on social media with people with whom you have a relationship and are aligned with your goal of keeping a professional presence on social media.


Consider whether you want to friend professional colleagues on social network pages. Although your goal is to maintain a professional personality on social media, you may want to either create a separate page for work colleagues and/or clients or make it a policy not to friend people from your professional life.
Maintain a secure page that only allows friends in your network to view your information and photos. A secure page provides you with more control over what people outside your network can see, allowing you to maintain a better grasp of how you are presented.

A complete Twitter profile makes it easier for people to identify what your account is all about. Tap the “Profile” button on the top right corner of the web page or from Twitter’s mobile app’s screen to view your profile page and complete any information you find missing.;
, Constantly posting tweets will make sure that your name stays on top of the newsfeed of your followers. Your Twitter followers will likely share your status to their subscribers if they keep on seeing you actively posting—which, in turn, could follow you too.


Besides constantly posting, make your tweets interesting by using media or information that’s relevant to your target followers. For example, if you’re trying to attract car enthusiasts, post any car-related topics or tips to attract this set of followers.

, Topics in Twitter are commonly identified and grouped by putting a hashtag (#) before the start of the topic title (e.g., #weather). Putting topics in hashtags on your tweets will allow your post to be viewable by the general public, especially when that topic becomes trending.


Using hashtags of already-trending topics will increase the chances of people subscribing to your account because your name and your tweet will appear on the list of related posts about a certain trending topic.

, Your followers can reply to the tweets you post. When you see people responding to your status posts, interact with them by giving a quick tweet-back. This will let people know that your profile is authentic and not just operated by an auto-post software, making it more engaging and encouraging other users to follow you.

, When people start to follow your Twitter account, be courteous and follow them back. This way, your profile can be exposed to their subscribers as well, which can attract followers to your account too.

Use Facebook as a distraction only on occasion.,
Don't overuse Facebook breaks.,
Don't get too involved in the Facebook game apps.,
Don't start fights.,
Don't write notes that you don't feel comfortable having everyone read.,
Don't use Facebook to friend people you barely know and try to get in touch with them.",How to Use Facebook for Good Not Evil1," Take short breaks from tough assignments on occasion. Sometimes when you're sitting in your dorm room working on that 15 page paper for your Lit class, you need a mental break. If you find yourself drooling while blankly staring at the cursor on your Word document, it may be time to take that break. Taking a quick look at Facebook can be a good way to feel like you're connected to the outside world after being locked up doing whatever task you may be doing. However, don't forget that Facebook isn't the only way to break your mental block:


Sometimes taking a 5 or 10 minute walk outside can help.
Or maybe drop in on a friend to say a quick ""hello."" Have a coffee and browse through your friend's summer vacation album you've been meaning to flip through... then, back to the grind!;
, If you need to clear your mind so that you can stop procrastinating and get to business, using Facebook to achieve more procrastinating won't fix things. It is all too easy for your five minute Facebook break to turn into a half hour to an hour Facebook ""break"". Don't let that happen; do whatever it takes to make sure your mental break doesn't turn into procrastination:


Set a timer if you have to.
Schedule reminder updates to land on your Facebook page five minutes into use with messages like ""Time's up dude!"" (You can use a third party program to do this.)
Have a roommate, colleague, or friend tap you on the shoulder--if you're both trying to break the habit, this can be a shared routine until you both break the habit.

, Beware of ""time-swallower"" Facebook applications. Many applications of the like are a pandemic! Not only are these applications a waste of time for you, they are for your Facebook friends as well. No one wants their mini-feed filled with ""Emma just found a lost cow on her farm!"" and few friends appreciate application suggestions sent to them that say ""Greg just added goldfish to his tank in Fish Life and needs your help!""


Don't waste your own time and don't waste your friends' time. Mindless Facebook applications such as these are addicting and can have you spending more time than anyone needs to be spending on a social networking site.

, You can use Facebook for ""evil"" by commenting negatively on your friends' posts. It is extremely tacky to start fights at all over petty things, but please refrain from starting fights over Facebook. If for no other reason, remember that Facebook world can see every detail of your fights (unless you put it into a private message, but that's beside the point...).

, Even if you only tag a few friends in the note, people are still able to look under the ""recent notes"" tab and read all their friends' notes and even notes that their friends were tagged in, even if not written by a Facebook friend. Remember, anything you post on the internet is subject to viewing eyes, so be selective with what you write. For example, don't write hate-notes about your ex, or notes about how awesome last Friday's party was (particularly if you know of people who weren't invited).

, We've all gotten friend requests from people that make us say ""Do I know this person?"" It seems a bit creepy and even superficial to friend people you barely know or don't know at all. Whether you friend them to start talking with them or viewing their information, or you just want more Facebook friends, this isn't the best way to use Facebook. It isn't quite ""evil"" until you start creeping on people.


Under certain conditions you can 'friend' people you don't know or barely know. Why? If you know you're going to meet someone at a party that day/night it is OK to friend them. Party guest lists are viewable on whatever party invite site the host happens to use. Friending allows the party guests to see your profile and that can be a great icebreaker. It also shows that you are thoughtful in that you have done something that few people do, i.e., take the time to look over the guest list.
So the person you friend isn't surprised by your invite you should send a note with the invite saying you will be at the same party that night and you have temporarily friended all the guests and they may delete the friendship tomorrow with no hard feelings.
The next day go to your friend page and delete the party friends. Also visit your invite history page and delete the unaccepted invites.
This is certainly unconventional so at the party expect attention. That is the goal, i.e., this will break the ice and start conversations that you might not have had and, who knows, you might make a real friend.

Add some fun applications to your Facebook profile.,
Post positive comments on pictures and posts that your friends put up.,
Write notes that keep friends and family up to date on trips you are taking or endeavors you are taking on.,
Use Facebook to keep in touch with old friends and long-distance friends.,
Find and support causes through Facebook.",How to Use Facebook for Good Not Evil2," There are some really cool ways to stay connected to people and hobbies you love just by adding an application to your page.


Look for applications that can help you to keep track of family members. A good one will let you share family pages that you can post messages and family photos on.
Another good way to use Facebook applications is to find one that creates a virtual bookshelf to let your friends and family know what books you're currently reading, want to read, or have read. Try to get one that lets you see your friends' reads too.

, Many people use Facebook as a way to display their talents. Some people post regular notes about a particular topic because they are aspiring writers, some people use photo albums as a way to display their interest in photography, and some people just use their Facebooks to keep their friends and family up to date with pictures and posts. Whatever your friends use their Facebook messages for, it always feels good to get a compliment.

, Some people do not have Blogger or Wordpress accounts and can't ""follow"" your blog regularly and receive updates. Facebook is a great medium to do this. If you post updates on your blog, you can copy and paste those updates into a Facebook note and tag your friends in it. You can also post the link to your blog into the ""share"" bar so that Facebook world can go directly to your blog whenever you post something new.

, People often ask the question, ""how did the world keep in touch before Facebook?"". The only way to keep in touch used to be email, and before email, phone calls, and before phone calls -gasp- written letters. Often people will make friends at work or school that move away or go back to their hometown that isn't anywhere near close to you. Facebook is a great way to share pictures, chat, and ""socialize"" with long-distance and old friends. Of course this isn't as good as personal interaction, but it can be a good substitute until you can see your friend again.

, A myriad of worthy organizations, people, and events to support are available on this networking site. You can use Facebook to find volunteer opportunities in your community, for instance. Or support organizations such as environmental causes, the arts, political and religious---pretty much any cause one could imagine, and more. Instead of wasting all your time on Facebook, you can use social networking to make the world a better place.

If it is connected it fetches the logged in users info and outputs this information in the console of your browser, that area is where you could build more onto this script to handle the data. You’ll also notice the not_authorized status. When the login is not authorized, this function changed the html on your page to ask you to log in. But how does this function get used? In this next function this is handled when someone clicked on the Facebook button on the page. Notice the onlogin=”checkLoginState (); in your body html code for the Facebook button.

, Open it in a browser you should see the Facebook login button. You can use the code provided by Facebook at the link listed above.


Log in and look at the console output. You’ll now see some basic info including id, email, first_name, gender, last_name, link, locale, name, timezone, updated_time, verified. That is all there is to it. Of course, there are many more scopes you can use which allow you to collect more data currently this script has a scope of public_profile and email, features and API calls you can play with to create your desired app. Just explore the Facebook documentation to discover all these features.

Strike back.",How to Move Beyond Facebook Envy," We tend to attribute positive experiences to others while at the same time amplifying negative impressions of our own life. In a study undertaken at Stanford University entitled ""Misery has More Company Than People Think"", researchers found that many of us have a tendency to over-inflate our misery without compensating for how much others around us are probably doing the same. In other words, we tend to underestimate how much other people experience negative emotions and overestimate our belief that they must be experiencing many more positive ones than ourselves. Our false perception of other's ever-positive lives is bolstered by the reality that in a social context, most people tend to conceal their negative emotions for a variety of reasons (a main reason being to smooth social interactions) and reveal a more positive side to outsiders than may be the case. This ""glossing"" can make it seem like other people are truly happier than our own self.
In the context of Facebook, another social milieu in which we're each ""watched"" by many others, the same compulsion to put forth the good, happy and fun news and to restrict sharing anything negative or depressing also exists. Indeed, there are hundreds of blog and book advisories telling social media participants to avoid ever being a Debbie Downer in the social media context for fear of losing followers or turning off friends or fans, so it's hardly surprising that status updates are going to constantly reflect a chipper attitude about life rather than revealing all the darkest within. While there is a sensible side to curtailing public broadcasting of an endless monologue of depressive thoughts, the one-sided personality of constantly fun-seeking, fun-having, totally fulfilled friends leaving their ever-so-bright updates on your wall, can soon convince you that they're all leading great lives. All this happiness misses the slip-ups, the moments of ""oops"" and ""oh dears"" that really show us to be human. And because you know yourself and spend more time ruminating on life's bumps as they pertain to you personally, it's not surprising that we're likely to be more judgmental about our own life. In which case, we tend to conclude that our individual self is suffering while everyone else is having a party.


One group more willing to reveal the rockier side of their lives is teenagers. They tend to openly report failures and feelings of been down more than other age groups.;
, It can be hard to grasp that people are glossing over everything and presenting a positive front in spite of suffering the same insecurities, unhappiness and blues that you might be experiencing too. Yet this understanding is vital to undoing your own perception that Facebook updates from your Facebook friends reveal more glamorous and exciting lives than your own. Understand that just as you're apt to cover up negative feelings when leaving Facebook messages, so too are your Facebook friends and it's likely they're doing it much more frequently than it seems.Some of the possibilities to be alert to when reading your updates include:



Fantasizing: Some people see Facebook as the easiest way possible to create a life they're not actually leading or to juicy up the one they're experiencing. To such people, suddenly all of their ""friends"" are a captive audience and they rationalize that nobody is actually going to check too closely on what they say they're doing/buying/wearing etc. (Although, see the following step for when it all gets a little too obvious that they're embellishing.)

Bragging (the ""exaggerators""): The need to brag can overwhelm some Facebook updaters and in giving in to this desire, the temptation to embellish increases too. Hence, a vicious cycle of someone else's bragging bravado or adventurism ends up causing you at the receiving end to feel like Cinderella in charge of the broomstick minus any pumpkin coach and impending ball.

Narcissism: Recognize that a number of your friends are possibly narcissists and great story-tellers to boot. They're good at suddenly reframing life's dull moments into ""Pay attention to me! Something's happened to me again in the last hour!"" It doesn't mean that they're deliberately misleading you but it does mean they have a compulsion to share, share, share, no matter how ordinary their update would be if you or someone else less narcissistic wrote it! (And this type of Facebook user starts to see life through Facebook update language, so they convince themselves that every moment becomes worthy of a Facebook update!)

The jilted avenger: Another possibility is the jilted ex who has noticed his ex still hasn't deleted him from her Facebook friends list, who then proceeds to rub in the great life he's now leading, all in the hope of getting to her. Unfortunately, in this case all other friends are ""collateral damage"" by being subjected to one person's personal crusade to prove a point pretending his life is way more exciting than it is. Hopefully you'll be able to see this for what it is and not allow this to leave you feeling less important! (You might also send the jilted ex a note reminding him that the rest of the world doesn't wish to be privy to his avenging strategy.)

, Pat yourself on the back for noticing when an ultra-happy updater seems to be stretching time. In some cases, a clone would be needed to manage the updates at the same time as leading their extraordinarily eventful life, either that or they're updating as they dive out of the airplane or ride the whitewater rapids... If you see way too many good life updates from someone that imply this person is living more hours than the day has, it's probable that they're inventing a bit more of good life than they're experiencing. It's only Facebook, and you have to pity someone who feels compelled to falsify happiness through the medium of online updates.

, Being connected constantly means you're a captive audience. And seeing endless amazing updates about other people's daily exploits as well as their enthusiastic energy for rounding up everyone on Facebook to visit their latest cause, their new business, or their new batch of photos of that to-die-for vacation to the nether regions of Borneo can leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth and a belief that your life is going down the drain faster than you can blink. But do blink. Blink long and don't open those eyes again until you've shifted yourself right off that Facebook page. Go and do something completely unrelated to Facebook, be it online or off. Treat yourself to the good life you think other people are having. You deserve it.


Read some comedy sites or a funny book; or watch comedy shows. Have a good laugh to help you stop feeling sorry for your lot in life.

Donate some money to people in need through an online charity. While you're there, have a good read of the needs of these people and how your money will make an enormous and good difference to their lives.
Ask friends to stay in touch via email, the phone or face-to-face when you're not on Facebook when they see you're not about. If they don't bother, then don't be bothered; fair-weather Facebook friendships aren't going to improve your life.

, Occasionally it's probable that you'll see an update that actually inspires you. Let it do more than that – let it inspire you to get off your backside, away from Facebook and out doing whatever it is that inspired you so much. A really good way of responding to envy is to recognize that you're envious because you want to be or do what has brought about the envy in you and then to allow yourself to be motivated by that envy to put plans in place for achieving the very same for yourself.

, Sift through the updates and only take on board that which truly impresses, uplifts and buoys you up. Life's short and you don't have time to wallow in the muck. Actively seek to find the good in what's on your wall and dismiss anything that causes you to feel a ""less-than"" type of person. If you find yourself turning green with envy or blue with sadness and convincing yourself that your life just doesn't match up to those updates, pinch yourself and remind yourself of the following:


""I have a good life. If it needs more excitement injected into it, I'm the one responsible for that, not anyone else.""
""I don't have to read or believe what I see on Facebook.""
""I know that people embellish their updates. I know which of my friends is very good at making her mundane daily activities sound as if they're extraordinarily exciting and while I appreciate her talent for clever writing, I know she's making most of it sound a heap better than it is for real.""
""I admire people who always see the glass half full. However, I also recognize that they're often making the best of bad situations. I can gain strength from their ability to remain positive through adversity but I don't have to bring down my own life because of it.""

, Start smiling a lot more and being grateful for the good things in your life. Get yourself photographed smiling, wherever you go. Be sure to post these smiling and laughing images on Facebook. Add upbeat quotes and spread praise for people you really care about. Be a source of genuine happiness on Facebook.


Find yourself some photos of children and kittens; they increase the cute factor and make it seem like your life is just one bunch of fluff and smiles.

Determine the type of firewall/blocking program.,

If your school uses Firefox, you may be able to take advantage of a trick to beat your firewall.,
For those not using Firefox at school, download Firefox and install it on a USB disk (This step isn't an option if you don't have a USB).",How to Go on MySpace on School Computers," Whether it is a hardware or software firewalls will determine how you will access it. The best way to do this is to ""fingerprint"" it. Open your browser (Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer, whatever your school uses) and go to a site you know is blocked (in this case www.Myspace.com Myspace). You should see a blocked message. Try to use this to figure out the type, for example, in my school the words '8e6 R3000' show up. Yours may be somewhere else in the page.;
, If the results show up and they are irrelevant, try to go on websites where you might be able to buy it. This is important because there will be specific information there which will tell you how it blocks Myspace and other sites, and might give you an idea as to how to go over its head.

, There is a problem with most firewalls when it comes to SSL, because it is an encryption.

, Obtain the IP address of the site(In Myspace's case this is 63.135.80.49 ). Then, covert each IP number into an eight digit binary number. If the number isn't eight binary digits long, pad it by adding some zeros in front (for example make 1 into 00000001). In our case this would be 63=00111111; 135=10000111; 80=01010000; 49=00110001. Now place the numbers together (Don't add them, just place) to create a 32-digit binary number. Again, in our case, this is 00111111100001110101000000110001 . (Without the period, of course). Then, convert this 32 digit binary to a decimal number. for Myspace this is 1065832497 . Enter this into your address field, without the www. part, and this will load the webpage.

Before you get a secret Myspace account because your parents prohibit you using it, try talking to your parents.,
Your parents are probably just trying to keep you safe, if all else fails, follow this guide but always be careful.

,
Make sure you close, or slightly shut, the door of the room you're using.,
Don't keep the volume too loud on your speakers.,
Download a copy of ""Matrix Locker"": this is programme similar to a screensaver which shows the ""The Matrix"" code but you can set a separate password from your user password.

,
Make sure you have fair reflexes.,
Don't forget to delete Myspace from your browsing history.

,
Make sure to use a browser with tabbed browsing, so if and when your parents come in, you can switch to another tab, and it will say you are on that site and not Myspace.,If your parents know your email address make new one just for your Myspace page (keep it simple)

,
Go to MySpace.com and make a Myspace page.,
Now that you've created your profile, get a picture, background, etc.,
Ask your friends not to tell your parents that you have a Myspace, but friends can be airheads sometimes, and forget.,
When you're talking to friends, try using an abbreviation for Myspace, such as ""MS"" or ""The Space"".,
Have fun being a Myspace user.

,
Don't post your photo.",How to Get a MySpace Account without Your Parents Knowing," Ask them about their concerns and try to make compromises as, for example, not using your real (last) name, city, age and/or any pictures of yourself.;
,, If you have a computer in your room, make sure it can't be seen when you first walk in. Get a bead curtain if it's your room, a loud one. They might imagine, rightfully, that you could get yourself into to some trouble.


Alternatively, you could try to find a place that isn't connected to your parents' Internet. If you have a laptop or other WiFi capable device, try connecting to a neighbor's network. If this isn't an option, try using a computer at your public library or at a friend's house.

, Myspace is great for music and videos. Don't use headphones, you may not hear your parents entering the room and then get caught.

,, If you don't, then practice. You must know how to type fast, and click fast.

,, Make sure to use something innocent like ""Google"", ""MSN"", ""Weather.com"", or a news page. If you liked ""neopets.com"" when you were younger, say you still think it is fun and use that, but avoid this if you used to say 'Neopets sucks!' because that would arouse suspicion.

,, Choose a plain, simple, and most importantly correctly spelled URL name. Avoid words like ""heart,"" gurl/boi,"" ""xoxo,"" ""roxxer"" or similar, as they are extremely lame and make you look childish, aside from the fact that you will later regret choosing such a stupid URL name. Preferably, you should exclude your name in one form or another. Avoid using your full name like ""Melissa Bourne"" for your Myspace name as it's easier to find you and your Myspace.

, Also add as many of your friends as possible. Try searching for them, or call them up and ask for their Myspace profile URLs. You don't have to ask every single one of your friends, since your friends will most likely be linked together.

, So just make up a clever excuse you can use.

, If your parents overhear (which they could), they will find out.

,, If you do, your parents might search Myspace for your name and find your account. Unless you decide to be sneaky and use a false name such as Jane Doe for other protection purposes as well.

First off is to add them to your friends.,
Try a simple comment.,
Try to get into a pattern, like having conversations every afternoon.,
Be interesting!,
Read your crush's profile and try to talk about things you have in common.,
Myspace flirting can help break the real world barrier.",How to Flirt With a Guy on MySpace," No flirting can be done online until you do this. Why? Well if your crush has a private page, you can't see it. Also, when they go to add you they'll be thinking ""Oh look, she requested me."" So your on their mind now! Also, usually people like to go visit recently-added friends on Myspace.;
, Just a ""Hey, what's up?"" lets a person know your interested. If you don't feel comfortable with doing this, try picture commenting. Go through their photos and find a cool one of when your crush went camping, or when they were just having a good time. ""oh my god that's so awesome!"" lets the person know you think what they do is cool, which is a bonus.

, For example, maybe your crush goes on every night before they go to bed. There's a fine line between stalking and getting into a pattern. When ever you go on, look at your online friends. See if they're on, and the next day see if they're on around the same time. Keep this under wraps- it can seem kind of weird. Every girl is entitled to a few secrets!

, If they ask you ""what's up?"" don't reply with ""Nothing much, you?"" That's so boring! A much better reply (even if your doing absolutely nothing!) ""Just sort of sitting around doing nothing. You?"" Its the same thing, but a full sentence gives your crush the idea that you actually care, (which you should).

, Like, ""So, I see you are into horses. I am too."" Or whatever it may be. It will be easier to get to know each other and break the ice if you talk about things you both like.

, If you find it hard to talk to a crush, do this first! Then you can ease into flirting, then hopefully dating.

Keep up with clan members.,
Think about what you want to do in the game.,
Keep up with powers.,
Avoid leveling up too fast.,
Watch how you attack.,
Create different characters.",How to Be Successful in Bloodlines," Because Bloodlines isn't that popular or known as Mobsters, it may be hard for some to gain members in a short amount of time. However, working on adding people in the forums is a good suggestion for a start.


The number of clan members you will use in attacking is 5 times your current level. So for example, a level 1 will use 5 members while a level 8 will use 40. You will be able to use 500 (maximum) when you reach level 100.;
, Do you want to be a ""rider""? Do you want to become a bounty hunter? Are you playing the game just for the missions? These answers will determine how to use your experience points. Most people favor the attack and defense area (depending on if they want to be an attacker or defender/rider) more than other areas. Always put at least one point in health.

, Each clan member that you use will be using one physical, one sensory, and one mystical power. So with the allowed clan members equation, you'll want 5 times of powers as much as your current level (30 powers in each section for a level 6 or 100 powers in each section for a level 20). Be careful of powers that have ""upkeep"". It could become expensive if you're not taking care of your companion amount.

, You'll soon realize that the higher up you go, the lesser chances of bounties and attacks you can make.

, It's an unwritten ""etiquette"" rule that 3 attacks in a row is significant, whether it's a loss or win. It tells the person attacked that they can be beat and it tells the person attacking that they can beat someone. Some to most people would judge more than 4 or 5 consistent attacks to be an issue.

, Under ""My Vampire"", you can create up to 10 characters under your account. All characters will share clan members and favor points. Making different characters at different levels will give you more opportunities throughout the game. Just note that you are only allowed to switch between characters once an hour.

Decide how long you want to take a break from social media.,
Choose when to take a break.,
Choose the networks you want to take a break from.,
Develop a schedule to gradually cut back on your social media use.,
Let your friends and family know you’ll be taking a break.,
Remind yourself why you are taking a break.",How to Take a Break from Social Media1," There’s no right or wrong period of time you should spend off of social media. The choice is entirely yours. You could choose to spend 24 hours off of social media, or you might spend 30 days off social media (or more).Don’t feel locked into the period of time you’ve decided to stay off social media. If you get to the end of your social media-free period and find you wish to continue your break, do so.
On the other hand, you can also shorten your social media break if you feel that you’ve accomplished whatever it is you wanted to accomplish by taking a social media break.;
, The best time to take a break from social media is during family vacations and holidays. This will give you and your family the opportunity to spend time each other in conversation rather than engaging in social media exchanges.But you might also take a break from social media if you need to commit all your attention to someone or something – for instance, when working on a school project.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed due to bad news and political mudslinging on social media, you might also take a social media break. You can look for clues that this is happening to you. For example, do you feel irritable after looking at social media? Do you fixate on things that you saw and think about them for the rest of the day? Do you have trouble focusing afterward? If so, then you probably need to take a break.

, Taking a social media break could mean a cessation of all social media use, or it could mean taking a break only from certain networks. For instance, perhaps you temporarily quit Facebook and Twitter, but stay on Instagram.There are no right or wrong ways to choose the networks you wish to take a break from. A good way to start the selection process, though, is to think about your reasons for desiring a social media break, and then take a break from the network or networks that will most directly allow you to achieve those goals.
You can also just log out of these sites and applications on your computer and phone. Having to log in every time you visit the site or use the app may reduce the chance that you will check them whenever you get bored or distracted.

, For instance, if you plan on taking a social media break between Christmas and New Year’s Day, work to reduce your social media use in the period prior to Christmas. Start cutting back about 10 days before you intend to take your break. The amount by which you cut back depends on how much you use social media.For instance, if you use social media for two hours daily, cut your social media use back to 1.5 hours 10 days prior to your break. Then, seven days before you plan on initiating your social media break, cut down to one hour daily. Four days prior to your break, cut back to 30 minutes daily.

, During your period of decreasing social media use, you might want to let your friends and social media followers know that you will soon be taking a social media break. This will let people know why you aren’t answering their messages and prevent them from worrying once your social media break begins.It will also help to keep you accountable whenever you pull out your phone and start to open the app.


If you wish, you could schedule posts to appear even while you’re taking a break., Without a good cause, you will have a hard time maintaining time away from social media. There are many reasons you might want to temporarily quit social media. Perhaps you want more time with your friends and family. Perhaps you are tired of using it every day. Whatever your reason, be able to clearly articulate it so that you can answer people who ask – because they ‘’will’’ ask.You may also want to keep a list handy to remind yourself why you are taking a break from social media.
It’s also important to be able to identify why you want a social media break in order to stay strong when you start to feel that you do not want to continue. In those moments, you can remind yourself, “No, I refuse to use social media until my designated break period ends because I want to spend more time with my family.”

Deactivate your account.,
Delete your account.,
Reframe the decision to take a break from social media.,
Distract yourself to get through the hard part.,
Recognize the contrived nature of social media content.,
Think before resuming your social media use.",How to Take a Break from Social Media2," For instance, if you typically access social media on your phone, delete the apps from your phone.If you tend to use social media on your computer, keep your computer turned off for the duration of your break from social media. A less extreme alternative is to simply turn off social media notifications on your device of choice so that you are not tempted to look.If you turn off notifications, be sure to turn off email notifications, too.

, If you find that you’re fitter, happier, and more productive during your social media break, you might want to extend the break to a full-time social media deletion. In this case, you’ll say goodbye to social media for good.The process for deleting your account varies with social media platform. Typically, it’s quick and easy, and requires simply navigating the user menu options to the section dealing with your account (which is usually called “Your Account”). From there, just click “Delete My Account” (or some similar prompt) and confirm your decision.
Remember, if you ever want to hop on a particular social media platform again later, you can, though you’d be starting from scratch.

, It’s easy to think of taking a break from social media as the exclusion of something. But instead, consider your time without social media as a liberation from the demands you may have unconsciously placed on yourself to constantly post new content and engage in social media interactions.Instead of posting on social media, you can now simply focus on enjoying whatever it is you’re doing wherever it is you are.Try keeping a mini journal with you and write in it whenever you notice that your day has been better than it usually is when you are always checking social media.

, There will probably be a few days where you really miss being on social media. But after a time – three days, five days, or even a week depending on how connected you are to social media use – you’ll begin to feel the urge to use social media decline. Stay strong through this rough period and know that it will pass. There are several ways to avoid temptation and temporary depression. For instance, you could:See a movie with friends
Catch up on your reading by grabbing a book off the shelf
Take up a new hobby like bicycle repair or playing the guitar.

, On social media, many people post only their best-looking photos and rarely – if ever – posts negative things about their lives. Once you see past this carefully calculated veneer of perfection, you will begin feeling more alienated from and skeptical of the whole enterprise.This sense of alienation will make you more willing to take a break from social media., If you do decide that you want to resume using social media at some point, then you might want to take some time to consider your decision. Make a pros and cons list to help you identify your reasons for wanting to resume your social media use.

For example, your pros might include things like “stay up to date about what friends are doing,” “have a place to share my good news and pictures,” and “engage in conversations with friends about interesting news.” However, your cons might include things like “get frustrated by political posts,” “waste time by checking my account too often,” and “worry unnecessarily over things I’ve posted.”
Compare your pros and cons to help you decide which option has the greatest benefit and make your decision.
You may also want to place some firm limits on yourself if you do resume your social media use. For example, you might set aside two 15 minute time frames per day to engage on social media and stay logged out of your accounts at all other times.

Connect with your friends outside of social media.,
Meet new people.,
Read a newspaper.,
Catch up on your reading.,
Organize your house.,
Take care of business.,
Be thankful for what you have.",How to Take a Break from Social Media3," Social media is not the only way to stay in contact with people. Instead of getting updates about what your friends are up to via social media, give them a call or send them an email or text message.Ask them, “What are you up to later? Would you like to grab some pizza and hang out?”, Without the constant instinct to check social media, you’ll be more engaged in the world around you. Strike up a conversation with your seatmate on the bus. “Lovely weather today, isn’t it?” you might say.You could also get involved in your community. Look up local charities or nonprofit organizations that offer volunteer opportunities. You might be able to volunteer at your local soup kitchen, food bank, or home-building organization (like Habitat for Humanity).
Check out local clubs and groups on Meetup.com. The site allows people to connect and share their favorite interests, including movies, books, and meals. If you don’t see a group you’re interested in, start one of your own!

, Social media isn’t just a great tool for communicating and seeing what others are doing. It is also often a primary mode of getting the news. But even without social media, you can stay informed. To read the day’s news, read a newspaper, visit the site of your favorite news purveyor, or grab a periodical covering current events from your local newsstand., Many people have a long backlog of books they promised themselves they’d get to “someday.” Now that you’re taking a break from social media, your “someday” has arrived. Settle into a cozy chair with a mug of warm tea and one of the books that seem most interesting to you.If you like reading but don’t have books of your own to read, visit your local public library and check out a few volumes that seem interesting.

, Dust, vacuum, and do the dishes. Go through your closet and identify clothes that you don’t wear anymore. Take them to the secondhand store for donation. Go through your books, movies, and games and look for ones that you’re willing to part with. Put them up for sale on Craigslist or eBay., Use time that you’d otherwise devote to browsing social media to reply to your other correspondence (email or voicemail).Get started on school projects or catch up on your homework. If you work from home, use social media time to locate new clients or revenue streams., Take stock of everything and everyone in your life that you’re thankful for. For instance, make a list of friends and family who are always there for you when you’re down. Make another list of your favorite things or places – your local library, for instance, or your game collection. This will redirect your attention from social media and make it easier to take and maintain your break from it."

Here's a method that doesn't even take faking it.,

Never appear as “available” to chat online.,
Last but not least, live this life you're creating.",How to Make Your Life Seem Awesome on Facebook," Photoshop is your friend on Facebook. The fastest and cheapest way to look better than everyone else is to Photoshop Taylor Lautner’s abs onto your photo, for example. Some do’s and don’ts for a realistic Photoshop photo:


Don’t mess with facial features. You don’t want to end up looking like a Photoshop version of Mickey Rourke or Kenny Rogers. If you aren’t rocking the face, you can still achieve supremacy using the “butter face” theory by focusing on body parts instead (everything’s attractive “but his or her face”). However, you can use Photoshop to erase some fine lines and acne. Another idea is to swap out hairstyles, especially if you no longer have any. Avoid having your updated do look like a wig––ask for opinions before posting any photo.
Select a body part that you can easily update. Breasts, stomachs, arms and legs provide good Photoshop opportunities. Rule of thumb––don’t go to extremes. For example, if you're a woman who has a chest that is flat as a pancake, don’t seek out Jessica Simpson’s chest to replace yours––it’ll only look fake. Unless big, fake stripper boobs are the goal, try someone closer to your size, but better, sharper, more refined.
Don’t go Heidi Montag on your photos because they'll only start resembling a Picasso painting. Subtle, natural changes are the only way to deliver a believable photo.
Add some friends to your photos. To avoid looking like the lonely loser, add friends doing fun things in your photos. You can either cut and paste your actual posse (but only choose the good looking ones) to pose along with single photos.
Generate exotic locations. You want to make Facebook friends believe you live a thrilling and exciting life (even if you haven’t left Mashpee, MA in over a year) so you’ll need to find photos of glamorous locations to use a backdrop. In fact you can create an entire album like, “Bali” or “South Beach.”
Sprinkle in a few “D” list celebrities. Although “A” listers would be the ultimate goal, you want to remain believable and make “friends” think that you really hang out with these people. Find age-appropriate D-list celebrities to give the appearance you are perhaps pals with these people. Young adults could get away with you posing with “celebrities” like Snooki, whereas middle-aged folks could try one of the “Real Housewives” (or even Andy Cohen) on for size.;
, When describing the photos of you and your D list bud, refer to them by first name such as “Kimberly” instead of “Snookie.” Also, if you create an album about your trip to Greece or any other thrilling destination, refer to it as your home away from home instead of “My Trip to Greece.” With such a casual reference, your friends will just assume that you visit this thrilling location often.

, Let’s be honest, if you're even thinking of ways to improve your Facebook life, you may need some imaginary friends. Since Facebook isn't supposed to be about making up fake accounts (indeed, fake accounts are a breach of terms and conditions, so if you get found out, the fake account can be deleted), creating a clique or entourage will require you to open separate email accounts, and use realistic names so that Facebook doesn't get suspicious. Tips to consider when making up fake friend profiles:


Limit the number of profiles you create. If you really want to maintain this ruse you’ll need to update their status as well. Too many profiles could be not only confusing but too time consuming.
Make sure everyone is interesting and attractive. Use stock photos for profile pictures but nothing too obvious such as cutting a pasting Victoria Secret runway model photos. (Also, see ""Warnings"" below for avoiding accusations of impersonating a real life person.) Give everyone cool jobs such as entrepreneur, Hollywood dog groomer or aerospace engineer. Also, vary the relationship status to add to the realism... not everyone can be single and hot.
Give friends different locations. If your hometown friends start asking why you aren’t partying with fake friend “Mike” (because he’s awesome on Facebook) the jig may be up. Even more awkward if you claim on Facebook you're out partying with this cool friend without your real life friends. Make sure the pretend friends live out of town, but are accessible.
Make the “friends” section for your imaginary friends invisible to others. Since you can’t create 1,000 friends for your fake friends, it’s better to make this area locked and mysterious to others. This will give the impression that these people are very exclusive and have a highly exclusive friend list.
Remember that these are “imaginary” friends. If you start opting to hang out with pretend Facebook friends over real friends (because let’s be honest, fake friends may possibly be way cooler) the time has come to consult with a professional therapist.

, Provide little to no details about your life other than an obscure description of your job. If you have to make up a job, do so with a very vague title like Chief Shepherd of Ideas or leave that area blank. Also, avoid divulging your political or religious preferences because that can take you into dangerous territory, which is sure to dampen the fun. If you're going to include multimedia “likes” make sure it is something critically acclaimed instead of saying you're a huge fan of “The Family Guy” or “Jersey Shore.” When it comes to relationship status, writing down that “it’s complicated” will provide mystery and intrigue. Don’t forget to post your birthday (year you were born is optional)––that way you’ll get lots of shout-outs on your big day.

, You want to give the illusion that you are too busy and cool for Facebook, having only just enough time spare to throw your peeps a bone with your update. Also:


Use your mobile phone for any status updates to give the appearance that you are on the go.
Update your status late in the day so that people will think you're out on the town whooping it up.
Have your fake friends comment on your status saying things like, “See you in an hour” or “You are boss!”

, Never write about what you're eating, reading, watching on TV or your health, and especially the weather––boring! People want to know how rad you really are and what exciting conquest you're on. Pull quotes from famous authors and poets to weave into your post such as, “Be obscure, clearly in work and play,” then add your friend’s name and the awesome location such as a concert or nightclub.

, Set a goal that's popular and interesting, then write about your daily progress. Keep it positive, keep up whatever it is and post small daily successes. If you succeed at something, anything from working out to DIY projects to learning to draw or speak a foreign language, gradually in very small successes, this becomes an irresistible draw. Especially if you reply to the comments by cheering on everyone else who's trying to work out, build a deck, learn to draw, save up for a trip to London or speak Spanish well.


Add pictures and describe your self-rewards at turning points, like the first decent Spanish paragraph, gaining an inch on your bicep or losing one on your waist, drawing a recognizable dog, getting the lumber for the deck at a good price. Build up to these posts with successive small post - it doesn't matter how tiny the baby steps are as long as they are always optimistic and you did them. The glass doesn't even have to be half full, if it's got a teaspoon more in it, that counts as optimism.
If you describe your troubles, follow them up with how you conquered them. This can turn any sick day, wound, pity party into the irresistible upward climb of the underdog.
If you don't want to lie about the exotic locations, you can build up to it by posting the baby steps a five or ten at a time, every time you skip a donut to put the dollar in the London fund more and more people will get interested in your goal. Other people's pictures, stock photos and asking for suggestions of where to go once you're there will attract people who've been and people who live there.
Every single day, list something positive toward achieving that specific cool goal you picked. Don't give up on it and pick yourself up after setbacks. If you had to tap the London fund to make your car payment, calculate how long the trip will be delayed rather than giving it up, set the new date and keep going. This is real grit and attracts genuine admiration, which has a more solid effect on your self esteem than tricking people into applauding fake success.
Make sure that goal is something you actually want to do, because if you keep this up long enough it will probably become real. At that point, you do need to make sure to get a lot of photos and definitely update your enjoying it. Then set a new goal once it's achieved, like going to India next or taking up a sport or redoing the kitchen, just something else that you want to do that will take a lot of time and effort to get it done.

, Since you're way too busy to comment on everyone’s status, select one or two friends (real or fake) and provide short and witty comments such as, “I concur!” or “Congratulations!” Meet these out over time to give people a total thrill when you do bother to drop them a line.

, Add more mystery to your Facebook life by opting out of the chat component. If you get busted online, you could become engaged in a question and answer session with someone who could expose your “real” life.

, Marlon Brando's character in On the Waterfront claimed that ""I could have been a contender. I could have had class and been somebody."" If you plan on replacing your dream to ""be somebody"" with a fake Facebook life, be prepared for the bubble of unreality to pop someday. Why not use Facebook as the spur to living a life you really want to be living rather than faking it out all the time? If you're telling people you're out partying, abseiling, building Taj Mahals, then get out there and give these things you dream of a go! You might just surprise yourself.

Understand hashtags.,
Create your own hashtag.,
Include an existing hashtag in your tweet.,
Be polite.",How to Use Hashtags With Twitter1," The universe of Twitter is vast and can be a little confusing to navigate. Hashtags are one of the most important and efficient ways of organizing information on Twitter. Anyone can make a hashtag at any time, simply by typing a phrase of the form “#topic” in a tweet.


For example, if you were tweeting about reading this article, you might say ""Reading #wikihow article on using #hashtags with #twitter."" Then, anybody searching for #wikihow, #hashtags, or #twitter would see your tweet.
After a hashtag has been created, other Twitter users can use that hashtag in their own tweets to add to the larger conversation about that topic. Hashtags can be as general (#wikiHow) or as specific (#HowToUseHashtagsOnTwitter) as desired. They are a completely organic form of organization, created and managed by Twitter users, not Twitter itself.;
, The form for doing this is exactly the same as for including an already existing hashtag. Simply type a phrase of the form “#topic.” Do not put any spaces in the phrase that you want to turn into a hashtag, because the hashtag begins with the “#” and ends with the first space. When you click “Tweet”, your new tweet will appear in your list of tweets, and the hashtag you created will appear in blue. Scroll over it and click on it to be redirected to the page for the hashtag. If you have really created a brand new hashtag, your tweet should be the only one on the page. Now, every time someone includes your hashtag in a tweet, it will be added to the page.

, You can do this simply by typing a phrase of the form “#topic” within your tweet. After you click “Tweet,” your tweet will appear in your list of tweets with the hashtag in blue type. Scroll over the hashtag and click on it to go to the page for that hashtag. Your tweet will now appear when other users visit the hashtag page.


If you wish to use an existing hashtag, make sure that your spelling is correct and that there are no spaces between the words you wish to include in the hashtag. Capitalization, however, does not matter. Thus “#wikihow”, “#wikiHow”, and “#WikiHow” will all produce the same result.

, When using hashtags, observe hashtag etiquette. Twitter's best practices suggest you not use more than two hashtags in the tweet, because this can dilute their usefulness for other users, and make it a royal pain in the eyeballs to read.


Understand the purposes of different hashtags. Some are obviously meant to be silly, while others are more serious. Make sure you observe these differences if you do not want to draw the ire of other Twitter users.
Only use hashtags that are relevant to the topic you're tweeting about.

"
"
Navigate Twitter using hashtags.,
Find hashtags that interest you.,
Look for hashtags in everyday life.,
Keep your eye online.",How to Use Hashtags With Twitter2," Clicking on a particular hashtag (in blue) will send you to the search results page where you will see other tweets that contain that hashtag. Near the top of the page, you can select “Top”, which shows tweets containing the hashtag that have been retweeted numerous times, “All”, which shows all tweets that include the hashtag, and ""People you follow"" to see only tweets from people you follow who used that particular hashtag.


You can also get to a search results page by entering the #searchterm in the search field above the list of tweets.
In the “Trends” sidebar on the left, you can view the hashtags that are currently the most popular throughout Twitter. Clicking on one of these will take you to a page of search results for that particular hashtag.

, As Twitter continues to grow, so does the number of hashtags. There are many ways to find hashtags related to subjects that you are interested in. Read through the Twitter feeds of people you follow, and click on any hashtags that you find interesting.

, Use of hashtags is a growing trend in advertising that can be highly entertaining, as anybody can—and will—piggyback on the marketing hashtag to say anything they want. To use one, simply add the hashtag to your tweet, and you will be joined in the conversation.


Similarly, live events like awards shows or sporting events include hashtags so that watchers can easily participate in live discussion. Your tweet may even appear on the air!

, You can do an Internet search for “cool Twitter hashtags” or “interesting Twitter hashtags about…” There are many sites that aggregate and share hashtags, making it easier to for you to find hashtags for subjects that interest you.


Check out social media apps such as Instagram or Pinterest, too. Mining those sites for interesting hashtags can lead to great results.

,

Retweet or ""RT"" - taking a tweet from one user and posting it yourself, automatically crediting the source, so that all of your followers can see the tweet. The original retweeting style would take a tweet and re-post it via your own account in the following format: 'RT @(username of person who originally tweeted the tweet you're retweeting): (contents of tweet)'. The current system does away with this format, and instead directly re-posts the tweet, crediting the origin underneath. For example, 'retweeted from @username'.

TweetUps - Using Twitter to meet with other Twitter folks.
Trending Topics (TTs) - ""Trending Topics"" lists a range of subjects which many users across Twitter are talking about simultaneously. When Twitter first got started, ""Trending Topics"" were those which were most popular during the span of the entire previous week. But new, more advanced algorithms have now made it easier to detect recent trends, and cite the very latest most-talked-about subjects. These days, the ""Trending Topics"" list contains things that thousands of people across the whole of Twitter are discussing at any one time. When you click on a Trending Topic in the list, it will bring up a range of tweets, mentioning each matter of interest, and for each Trending Topic there will be up to three 'Top Tweets' highlighted--Those are the tweets in each topic which have been retweeted more than 150 times. You can view a list of trends in your area in the right-hand column of the homepage.
Lists - Users can organize the people they follow into lists of businesses or personalities which are related in some way. For example, a user could list all of the NPOs and charities they follow into a single list, for easy reference.
Promoted Tweets - A single trending topic which a company or organization can pay to 'trend', as to gain attention and traffic from Twitter users worldwide.;
, If you want to let your followers know what you are doing, type it into the 'What's happening?' text box and then click on the 'Tweet' button. Note that tweets are limited to 140 or fewer characters; otherwise, the ""Tweet"" button will go into a minus.


As you type, a countdown is offered to help you keep track of the character count of your tweets. The allowed characters are in gray, then the last 10 go red, and then a red minus symbol appears when you are past the zero (0) indicator.

, Prefacing a word with a '#' will create a hashtag. A hashtag makes a certain word easily searchable. For more information on hashtags see the wikiHow article on How to use Hashtags with Twitter.


Some Trending topics will include hashtags, thus making it easier for users to tap into a Twitter-wide conversation regarding a single matter of interest.
A prime example of the usage of hashtags can be seen with Major League Baseball, which uses team-name hashtags (#Mets, for example) to pull together lists of in-game tweets, which they display on their website.

, Your Twitter can be as intimate or as big as you choose. If your goal is to gather lots of followers, though, be sure to keep your posts interesting and relevant. You shouldn't underestimate the power of following others, either—often times if you follow someone they'll follow you back. Finally, give your favorite followers shout outs occasionally. This could be through direct tweets, blogs, or a simple #FF (#FollowFriday) mechanism. This is where you tweet a short list of your key followers who you think would be good for others to follow and include the hashtag #FF, they are generally sent out at the end of the week hence the name. This will often be reciprocated, meaning your name gets circulated. However, #FollowFridays are going out of fashion and many commentators question their worth due to their spam-like nature. A simple RT (re-tweet) can be a very effective way of attracting followers. Re-tweets are a real time affirmation of someone else's statement and is often rewarded with a follow.

, Click '@Mentions' to see if there are any replies to any of your 'tweets'. When tweeting, using '@' followed by a username (with no spaces) in your tweet will send a mention to the user you choose. For example, '@username' will send a mention to 'username', and the entire tweet will show up in his '@mentions' section.

, Twitter, like many social media applications, can become addicting and time-sucking. Make a decision early on about how much time you will devote to it and about how big your ""tribe"" of followers will be. Avoid worrying about getting heaps of followers; that's competitive rather than relating and it will end up wearing you out. Instead, focus on quality connections and information-sharing and don't get too upset when someone unfollows you; it happens and you can't change it. If you feel Twitter is overwhelming at any time, simply take a break from it and come back later, refreshed.


Anthropological and sociological studies have claimed time and again that we can only cope with being part of a tribe of 150 to 200 people.Anything more than that and we get confused and lose the intimacy of connection. Keep that in mind when aiming for too many followers!

, You will probably find that you know quite a few people on Twitter. Twitter will automatically suggest famous people to follow but this option is not mandatory. Using the menu tab on your page click on 'Who to Follow', and there are several ways to find people on Twitter, as follows:


Use the 'Find Friends' link to find people you know through your various Gmail, AOL, MSN, Hotmail and Yahoo! accounts.
Use the 'View suggestions' link for a wide range of possibilities that may, or may not, connect with your interests. (Twitter is also working on personalizing lists of suggested followers, so keep an eye out for the feature.)
Use the 'Browse Interests' tab to find people by interest.

, There are many business, companies, celebrities, and non-profit organizations on Twitter, ranging from Stephen Fry (@stephenfry) to Greenpeace (@greenpeace).

, If you're following lots of people, it can get hard to sift through all the tweets. For easy reference, you can organize the people you follow into a list.

, Under your profile picture, you have the choice to enter your full name. Adding a full name allows you to keep a professional aspect regardless of your username. You can also enter a location to let people know where you're tweeting from and link to your homepage or blog if you desire.

, Make it eye-catching and interesting. Do it just right and it will help you build up followers; people thinking of following you do read the biographies to see if they have reason to follow you. Bear in mind that a biography can be up to 160 characters long, so you'll have to keep it short and to the point. Don't worry about typing your real name or website URL here—those can both be entered separately (as shown in the previous step).

, This can give you more view per tweet. If you so desire, click the ""Posts your Tweets to Facebook"" button at the bottom of the profile page.

, Under the ""Account"" tab of settings, you have the ability to change the language and time zone that your Twitter is in. Do so by selecting the desired language and time zone from the drop down menus. You can also change your username and email address here if you ever need to.

, This is different than the location on your profile—it is specific to each tweet and can be as general as a town or as specific as your exact location. Even when this feature is enabled, you have the option to turn it on or off with each individual tweet.

, These are listed under the Account tab of your settings. Check the applicable boxes and hit save.

, Protect your account by periodically changing your password. To do so, click on the ""Password"" tab under Settings. Enter your old password, then your new one twice. Hit ""Change"" when finished.

, Under the ""Notifications"" tab, there is a list of actions. Check the boxes next to those actions for which you'd like to receive an email.

, Every profile begins with the default background and color scheme. However, you can personalize it if you wish. Click on the ""Design"" tab of Settings. You can choose from one of the background images provided, or upload your own by clicking on the button that says ""Change Background Image."" Then, click on ""Choose File"" to upload one from your computer. You can also play with the color scheme by clicking ""Change Design Colors.""

, DMs are direct messages. They go straight to the intended person that you are messaging. The DM feature uses an inbox and outbox system, but you are still limited to using 140 characters; you are also limited to sending DMs to only those users who follow you. DMs cannot be seen by anyone other than yourself and the chosen recipient, and are thus more personal. To send a DM, go to the page of the follower you're sending one to, and click on the ""Message"" box.


Be aware that some people really dislike DMs on Twitter because they reason that Twitter is an open conversation and a fast one, not a disguise for sending each other private messages. Also, DMs are not appreciated when they involve marketing or advertising.

, Third-party applications such as TweetDeck and Twitter for iPhone (iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad), or Twidroid (Android) can help you to manage your Twitter account(s) better. If you have lots of followers and if you follow lots of people, at which point it can be difficult to keep up with everything on Twitter's official website, you might want to try something a bit more advanced like Hootsuite.

If she adds you back, great.",How to Add Your Crush on MySpace," If you are too shy to talk to her, bite the bullet and talk to her in person or over the phone. If you talk to her, you are more likely to be seen as a good acquaintance or friend than just a stalker. Compliment her on her clothes, hair etc. Find out what she is interested in and what she likes to do for activities, her job, etc.;
, If she says yes, proceed to step three. If she says no, ask her if she is on other sites or just ask her for her number, like the good old days. Ask her for her URL.

, If she does not have one, go to find people and search for her first and last name.

, You don't want to be hooking up with somebody who is acting single but it is really taken. If her profile is private, give it a gamble and add her anyway. It is mandatory by law and Myspace regulations for 14 and 15 year olds to have private profiles and there are lots of older people that have private profiles as well. If you are older than 18 and are digging for a minor, it will ask you if you know the person. By that time, it is better off to date adults than teenagers.

,, If she doesn't add you back, she might be a rare Myspace user or she might not know you enough to add her on Myspace. Check the last login date. If she was last online three to six months ago or earlier, she probably gave up Myspace or is a very rare user. Get to know her a little better in real life, instead.

If you simply can't resist the urge to check your home page, then it's clear that Myspace is controlling you and not the other way around.;
, If you don't want to cut them off completely, consider just taking the friendships that you value off of Myspace. Get their phone numbers, email addresses, AIM screen names, ICQ numbers, or any other information that may be a way of contacting them outside of Myspace. (See Tips.)

, You've probably personalized it and tweaked it to reflect your personality. In a way, it's a work of art that you created. You don't want it to be lost forever, so save a copy in print. Having a hard copy will make it easier to let go of your profile online.

, Make it into a plain Myspace profile, like it was when you started it. End all blog subscriptions that you have signed up for. Turn off all of the e-mail notifications.

, Delete your main pictures, blog, comments, friends, and etc. If your profile is set to private, set it back to normal. Reset the information about yourself.

, Stop using Myspace. Get an e-mail filter and set it to block Myspace, Facebook, or any other similar sites.

, Try to find activities that both amuse you in the short-term and benefit you in the long-term. Myspace only provides a short-term pleasure (usually). Keep in contact with your friends through phone, e-mail, or messenger. Not talking to them may make you want to return to Myspace. After waiting a good month and re-establishing your life, go back and delete your Myspace. It shouldn't, at this point, rip your heart out to do so. Never go back to Myspace, as it will possibly trigger a relapse into the addiction again.

Follow and be followed by people in your area.,
Send out a general invitation tweet to see if there is any interest in a Tweetup.,
Consider making a specific hashtag relevant to your Tweetup.,
Find other ways to spread the message.",How to Organize a Tweetup1," It's best to know some of the people who will attend and those who are local are your best bet. You can usually see where people come from by reading their location status on Twitter, although some people choose to keep this secret. Focus on the people you know to be local or who can get to the location with ease. That said, don't dismiss people who might be able to turn up even if they live somewhere other than locally––people travel a lot and may be able to drop in when in your area on business or they may even make a special effort to turn up, especially if they can get a cheap flight or a lift with someone else.


To narrow down people who are in your local area, there are services such as Twitterlocaland Twellow.;
, Name the date, time and location, along with giving a very clear reason for the meeting. For example: Tweetup 4 Coffee Lovers - Barney's Coffee Shop Tues Mar 4th 6:00 PM.


Be prepared to accept ideas and suggestions from your followers. Perhaps you suggested a certain time but most of those keen to come suggest that an alternative time would work better––be flexible about it. Or, maybe you have suggested that the event will be to do X, but many of your followers suggest that maybe Y would be more interesting. Again, be flexible and ready to take on board what everyone is enthusiastic about.
Answer all questions about the Tweetup clearly on your Twitter account, so that all of your followers can gather the information together.

, Having a specific hashtag can help your followers recognize tweets specifically relating to the event, as well as finding all relevant tweets quickly.


Encourage retweeting so that the message gets spread far and wide.
You may need to try a few times before finding a hashtag that is free to use. Aim to keep it as short as possible––Tweetup can be abbreviated to TU, for example.

, Although this is primarily about getting your Twitter friends together, there are other resources online for gathering the masses. Make use of them and use at least one of the online meeting sites as well as your Twitter call-to-action. Sites like Meetup.com and Eventbrite are very helpful for spreading the word even further. If using such sites, a link can be supplied on your Twitter invite too (saying something like: ""more details on Meetup"").


As well, use Facebook and Google+ as another avenue for spreading the word. Any social media networking site can be used to promote your Tweetup.

Work on your profile.,
Compose interesting, funny or thought-provoking tweets.,
Tweet often, at the right times of day.,
Use hashtags.,
Follow everyone who follows you.",How to Get More Followers on Twitter1," Make sure your profile is complete with an avatar that shows your face and a solid bio. It's important that people know who you are and what you're interested in.


The simplest and most personal way to go for an avatar is a photograph of your face looking straight into the lens. Avoid funny angles or having anything else in the photo. Crop it into a square, but don't shrink it down. You want people to be able to click on it and see the larger version.If you own a company and want to use your brand as your avatar instead of a photograph, this is perfectly acceptable. However, using random graphics or images as your avatar can give the impression of a face or spam account, so they are not recommended.
Many people will read your Twitter bio before deciding whether to follow you. A good written bio can help you get much more followers than a poorly written bio.;
, Most potential followers will glance at your most recent tweets to see if you're worth following. Therefore, it stands to reason that the better your tweets, the more followers you'll gain.



Add variety. Make sure you're tweeting on a variety of subjects and not just your personal thoughts or what you're doing at the moment. Talk about your hobbies and interests, share a piece of insightful advice, or post a photo of something cool to switch it up.

Be interesting, transparent and provocative. Share intimate news about your life. If you can spin a good story, you might get readers addicted to the daily dramas of your everyday life.

Post interesting links. Find the man bites dog story. Search the web voraciously for a nugget you can spin into a good tweet. Guy Kawasaki, who has over 100,000 followers, goes as far as paying employees to find buzzworthy stories for him to tweet.There are many websites you can scour for prime Tweeting material

Post multimedia. Switching things up with pictures, videos and even sound clips here and there can make your posts more fun to follow.

, Nobody wants to follow someone who never tweets, therefore it's important to remain consistently active on twitter. You should have a minimum of one post per day and ideally two posts per day to maximize your visibility in the Twitterverse.


It's also important that you post your tweets at a time of day or night when the most people are active. No one will see your tweet or have the opportunity to follow you if you're always posting when they're asleep. The best times to tweet are before people go to work in the morning (pre-9am) and after they finish in the evening (around 6pm).
Make sure to take your time zone into account though. Most Twitter users live in the US, so you will need to tailor your tweeting times to either East coast or West coast schedules.
On the other hand, it's important not to inundate your existing followers with too many tweets, as this can fill up their feed and come across as spammy, which might cause them to unfollow you.

, Using hashtags is a great way to connect to people with similar interests and to increase the visibility of your tweets.


Add hashtags to your tweets and also create tweets based on hashtags that are popular on Twitter at the time (you can see these as ""trends"" on the left-hand side of your Twitter home page). This will maximize your tweet's exposure.
However, like everything on Twitter, hashtags should be used in moderation. Just pick one or two relevant or amusing hashtags which add to the quality of your tweet. Don't just add hashtags onto words that appeared in the rest of your tweet, or include them just for the sake of it.

, It might seem counter-intuitive to do this when you're focused on gaining followers, but it's a good practice because people who notice that you didn't follow them back might unfollow you. Like other social media sites, Twitter is a ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" type of environment.Also, when you follow back, some people might respond to you publicly, which will give you some added exposure to their followers.
If you're worried that you won't be able to keep up with that many people, you're right. Once you're following over 100 people, it'll be pretty much impossible to read all their updates. You'll become more selective in who/what you read.

You should provide instances of your appearances in the news, high-traffic content producers, or other evidence of your public influence.
Your official website is already provided on your Twitter profile, so don't worry about listing it again.

, In the box below, write a blurb justifying your request for verification.


For individuals, demonstrate your impact. Outline your public reach as well as one or two key ways in which you've changed your field.
For companies and corporations, outline your mission as well as your success at achieving it.

, You will be taken to page asking you to confirm your submission.

, Your request will be sent for review. Once a decision has been made, you will be notified via e-mail.

, If Twitter decides that you qualify for a verified account, they will reach out to you via direct message. Click the link in the direct message to be taken to finish the process.


If your request is denied, don't fret! You can re-submit your request after 30 days.

, The final part of the process has 3 parts: (1) Learn how to Tweet effectively, (2) Connect with other Interesting Twitter Users, and (3) Protect your Account.Learn how to Tweet effectively gives you a choice between 2 tweets and asks you to choose which one is better. It has the form of a quiz, but there will be no negative effects if you do not answer correctly. It is designed to teach you to increase your Twitter followers.Connect with other Interesting Twitter Users gives you the option to follow other verified accounts. Twitter believes that this gives you more legitimacy as a verified user.Protect your Account asks you to enter a phone number that Twitter can call if there are any problems with your account. Once you have completed this step, your account will be verified., Once you have received a verification badge, it is important to keep your account information the same. Changing information, such as your profile image, can cause Twitter to remove the badge, forcing you to contact them again.

, The most common reasons for verification - whether you submit the request yourself or get handpicked by Twitter's verification team - include being a highly recognizable public figure (musicians, actors, athletes, artists, public officials, public or government agencies, etc.), or if your name and likeness is parodied or impersonated on multiple Twitter accounts, leading to identity confusion.Twitter will not consider you for verification based on your number of followers. Twitter urges Tweeters to ""Please note that follower count is not a factor in determining whether an account meets our criteria for verification.""Similarly, the number of tweets you post is irrelevant. For more information, read the Verified Account terms. These terms explain what a verified account is, what it means to be verified, who has the verified badge, identifying a verified account, etc. They can be found here.

, There are a number of prerequisites you'll need to have to be able to move through the entire request process. Before submitting a request, make sure you have:


A verified phone number
A confirmed email address
A bio
A profile photo
A header photo
A birthday (for accounts that are not company, brand, or organization accounts)
A website
Tweets set as public in Tweet privacy settings

, Most Twitter accounts that become verified are easily identifiable across all channels of communication available on the site. To make your brand easily identifiable:


For individuals: Set your Twitter name to reflect your actual name.
For corporations and companies: Set your Twitter name to reflect your company or corporation's name.
Choose a high-quality profile photo that matches you, your company, or your brand.
Set an e-mail address that matches the one you use for business inquiries, if you have such an e-mail address.
Link your Twitter profile from your official web page. Also include your website's address in your Twitter profile. It's most important that you link to your Twitter account, as linking sites from the Twitter account doesn't prove that the Twitter account is legitimate.

Twitter recommends embedding a ""Follow"" button on your official web page or blog. This will ensure that your readers are easily finding your real account.
Link to your Twitter profile in your other social profiles such as Facebook and LinkedIn. All of these links will help verify that you are who you say you are.

, Although Twitter claims that the number of tweets a user posts does not affect their decision to verify an account, being an active and engaged Twitter-user is still very important for the verification process. Post frequently, be interesting and topical, use tags, ask questions and reply to your followers, never troll, and follow other verified accounts.

, Most celebs don't petition Twitter for a verified badge by themselves; they have an agent do it for them. Hiring an agent will lend your ""public figure"" status more legitimacy, especially if you can find an agency with prior connections to Twitter.



Click here for instructions on hiring an agent.

, Though Twitter does not have an official stance on this, several Twitter-verified companies have indicated that spending $5000/month on Twitter advertising will also get (and keep) your account verified., Some high-profile companies (such as Buzzfeed) have a deal with Twitter whereby all of their top-ranking employees are automatically granted verified accounts. This may not be the easiest option, but it's something to think about."

Look around for venues.,
Decide whether it's going to work simply turning up somewhere as a group or whether you need to book the venue.,
Choose a setting that will make your guests feel safe and comfortable.,
Ensure that the place has wi-fi.",How to Organize a Tweetup2," If you are a mover and a shaker in your neighborhood, you might need a larger venue than the corner coffee shop. Be sure it will fit your needs. And importantly, actually go to the venue to check it out. Inviting people to a place you've never been to before, only to discover it's dingy or unsavory, will disappoint your guests. Some things you will want to take into consideration are:


The type of people that will be attending: Students? Professionals? Artists with their tools?
The formality of the event: suit and tie or jeans and t-shirt? If you're suggesting a cocktail party, the guests will need evening attire, while a chat about artwork around the coffee table only needs jeans.
The kind of money that they might be able to spend. Don't choose an expensive restaurant if you're inviting people who are stretched for money. Always consider what would be fair to expect of people to spend––for a first meeting, probably enough to spend on a cup of coffee and a cookie is all you should expect.
Parking and seating. Make sure there is enough. It can help to tweet parking or transport advice to guide your guests.

, This can be a bit tricky because not everyone who says they'll turn up will turn up, so bear in mind that your numbers are likely to be fairly fluid and booking a hall for an expected 100 people when only five turn up can be an expensive waste of time. For your first Tweetup, keeping it simple is the best approach––choose somewhere that doesn't need to be booked and have a back-up plan if more people turn up than your chosen venue can handle.


If more people show up than expected (this event is being broadcast across Twitter after all), such as people you weren't sure about coming turning up after all and bringing a friend who brings their friend, then be sure to have an alternative ready. Perhaps move from the little coffee shop to the big one down the street or go to the park if it's good weather. Again, keep it simple and consider the suggestions of others.

, If it's a large venue, make sure you aren't on the wrong side of town. If it's a small one, consider something like a library or a coffee shop––a public setting will help people meeting you for the first time feel more at ease.


Make sure the location matches your group's style. If your fellow tweeters are all beer-drinking bikers, a library might not be the best place.

, Twitter users will expect that they can tweet, so it makes sense to check this out in advance. Of course, there will be exceptions, such as if you've organized a back country hike or a tour of the cellars where no signal gets through, but within reason, have wi fi available.

Be sure you have some kind of draw.,
Plan what to do about food.",How to Organize a Tweetup3," While you might garner a little group of devotees to meet up at the local coffee shop for a ""get-to-know-one-another"" chat, this won't be sufficient for most of your followers. While networking is a valid and motivating reason for getting together, there needs to be a substantial reason beyond this to encourage people to leave their cocoon of routine and to come along to your event. Give them something to talk about by having something more than just a chat over coffee. Here are a few possibilities:


A speaker - do you know someone who will be of great interest to your followers? Perhaps a renowned blogger, an expert in wine tasting, a recovering shopaholic or someone who has inspiring messages to pass on?
A shared activity - if your followers are grouped around a mutual interest such as art, craft, beer tasting, collecting, etc., you will likely have a ready-made activity idea that springs from that interest. Of course, if you need materials or to book a location, you may need to recoup costs or ask for bring-your-own items, so know all of this well in advance.
A shared meal - for the gourmands, the lovers of eating out and the tweeters who share every intimate detail of meals about town, a shared meal might be just the draw card needed.
A topic of common interest to discuss (be prepared to get things started and to moderate a bit) - this could be tied in with a speaker, it could be guided by a loose agenda or it could be simply an occasion for everyone to share their thoughts about something that matters to the local community, such as the proposed demolition of heritage houses to make way for a freeway. If the topic is something people are passionate about and are dying to get together to talk about, it may be all you need to rally the troops.
A place to explore together, such as a museum or park - this is great for the active people who love to learn as they do/go/walk/cycle/etc. You might like to make the event coincide with an exhibition, a special event or a visiting specialist's talk.
A barbecue or party - this can be really useful where you're trying to get a community to come together for a particular reason, be it activism or simply getting to know one another.

, If you will all meet at a restaurant and split the bill, say so. If a super large venue, consider having it catered. Either way, spell out in advance what food is available. If there is no food, it's just as important to let people know, in case they plan on turning up starving.


If alcohol is involved, make it clear that it's pay-for-your-own. That is, unless you have a bottomless pocket.

"
"
Give everyone a name tag.,
Get out there and talk to people.,
Embrace everyone who attends.,
Be helpful and gracious.",How to Organize a Tweetup4," Provide large labels and pens for writing their Twitter handle on the label. Encourage this from everyone, as it's the best way people will get to know one another initially––recognizing a Twitter handle can be a wonderful icebreaker.


If you know the names of attendees in advance, you might like to print off labels for them. However, this may not be realistic unless you have an exact list of participants.

, Start conversations. Introduce one another and, as organizer, try to move around. When you're the organizer of the event, you're responsible for ensuring that those who have gone along to it are having a good time and are getting into the spirit of the occasion.

, Even if you meet someone whose tweets have annoyed you, remember that this person has made the effort to turn up. And getting to know people for real is a whole lot different from being irritated by their online babble! You may find you have much more in common than you realized by extending a warm handshake and being willing to listen.

, At the beginning of the event, thank everyone for attending and explain what the Tweetup is all about, and what you hope that the attendees will get out of the event. At the end of the event, thank everyone once again, both for attending and for making the event worthwhile.


If you would like contact details or indications of enthusiasm for future Tweetups, leave a list for placing details on, along with a marker, and encourage people to fill this in at some stage during the event.

"
"
Tweet about the event as it unfolds––before, during, and after.",How to Organize a Tweetup5," Be constantly positive and encouraging. Many people will balk about meeting up with people they don't know, or don't know very well. Even the best of us can be crowd shy. But if people read about how much fun people are having and how interesting the event is, some may be curious enough to come along or will at least be aware that your next Tweetup is definitely worth attending.


In the days after the event, continue tweeting about it. Mention to particular individuals how great it was to meet them, make comments about things learned and suggestions for future get-togethers. This will help to maintain the momentum and shows everyone that the event was a success and that it was taken seriously.

"
"
Direct people to your Twitter account.,
Try to get celebrities or famous people to follow you on Twitter.,
Follow people with similar interests, then follow their followers.,
Ask people to retweet you.,
Repeat your most popular tweets.",How to Get More Followers on Twitter2," You can direct more people to your Twitter account by putting ""Follow me on Twitter"" links on your blog, e-mail, other social networking outlets, and across the web.


That way, people who are already interested in what you're doing can easily find your Twitter Profile and follow you.
Using graphics, such as a button or counter can also be more effective at catching attention and getting you more followers.

, That will increase the chance that they will tweet at you or retweet one of your tweets, increasing the visibility of your Twitter account.


You can get a celebrity's attention on Twitter by sending them an @message. An @message is a direct message which you can send to anyone, whether you're following them or not.
Choose a celebrity (or at least someone with a ton of followers) to send an @message to. This message will appear on your profile page, so anyone who comes to scope you out will see who you've tweeted.
If you're really lucky, the celebrity will reply to your message, retweet it, or maybe even follow you back. This will make your tweet visible to thousands or even millions of people, and undoubtedly gain you followers.
Although this doesn't happen that often, it's worth sending a direct message or two everyday on the off-chance that it's gets retweeted. Remember, the funnier or more original the tweet is, the better the odds of the celebrity paying attention to it!

, This sounds kind of complicated, but it's really not. Just look for users with similar interests to your own, but who have way more followers. Then all you need to do is follow that user and their followers.


For example, if you're a tarot fanatic, find another tarot fanatic who has many followers, then follow those followers. If it's clear from your bio and your tweets that you're a tarot enthusiast, they're more likely to follow you.
Be cautious though; following too many people may draw potential followers away.

, Being retweeted pushes your exposure to the edges of your Twitter network. Simply adding ""Please retweet"" or ""Please RT"" to the end of some of your posts here and there (not all the time) can remind your followers that you want them to spread the word for you. Occasionally posting a link to an article on How to Retweet will also help your followers help you.

, Do a search for your Twitter name and observe which of your updates get the most replies and retweets. Then repeat those updates a few times roughly 8-12 hours apart.


You'll reach more people this way because you're more likely to catch the attention of people who missed your updates the first time around. People ""tune in"" to Twitter at various times during the day (and night).
If you get complaints about repeated tweets, you might want to ease off a little (or just delete the complainers!)"
"
Regularly unfollow people who haven't followed you back.,
Follow people who autofollow.,
Use keywords to find followers.,
Consider buying some followers.,
Finished!

",How to Get More Followers on Twitter3," This is especially important to avoid follow limits. The first limit you'll probably hit is when you've followed 2,000 people. You won't be able to follow any more until you have 2,000 followers.


When this happens, you'll need to ""clean-up"" your list by unfollowing people who haven't followed you back. Aim to unfollow people who don't post that often, or whoose tweets you aren't really interested in. Then you won't feel like you're missing out.
However, as the list of people you're following grows, it will become more and more time-consuming to go through it and filter out the non-followers. Luckily, there are services like Twidium and FriendorFollow which can clean up your list for you.
Once your list is cleaned up, you'll be able to follow a whole new selection of Twitter users, and - if you choose carefully - most of them should follow you back!

, ""Twitter celebrities"" (Twitter users with huge numbers of following and followers) are also likely to follow you back automatically.They'll be following over a thousand or sometimes tens of thousands of people, but unlike spammers, they'll have the same number of (or more) followers.
You'll stumble upon such accounts during your Twitter travels (e.g. when they are retweeted by someone you're following), but you can also do an Internet search for ""most popular Twitter accounts"" or ""popular Tweeters"".
People who follow spammers are likely to be autofollowers. Wait until a spam follower follows you. Spam followers will have 1,000+ people they are following, but only 5 to 150 followers in return.
Follow everyone who follows the spam follower. Those are likely to be people who are following in return in order to boost their own follow count.

, One good technique is to search for tweets with keywords related to your topics of interest.


Let's say you're a metalhead. Look for people who mention your favorite metal groups. Reply to their tweets and then follow them. Your response will show them that you have something in common, and make it more likely that they'll follow you back.
Better yet, retweet them if the content is good. Not only are you forming connections with other Twitter users, but you're also bringing good content to your followers.

, There are many services available that allow you to trade currency for followers. For the most part, these followers will be bots (fake accounts set up for the purpose of boosting numbers), but your number of followers will increase substantially.


Devumi, FastFollowerz, TwitterBoost, BuyRealMarketing, and TwitterWind are all reliable services for delivering followers, all of which cost between $12 and $20, offer some form of money-back guarantee, and increase your followers by a serious increase of 300,000-500,000.If you're operating a personal account, stick to building followers the old-fashioned way. It's easy to see when one of your friends buys fake followers, which can be kind of embarrassing if it comes out. Buying followers is more commonly employed by businesses and celebrities for whom it is important to display a large number of followers on Twitter. Politicians and popular musicians are often followed by a large number of fakes.There are many risks to follower-buying. Many services don't guarantee followers for an extended period of time, meaning you could have hundreds of thousands one week, and much fewer the next. Many follower-sellers are simple scams designed to get your credit card information or gather contact information spam your real followers.

Determine whether or not your app will cost anything for those interested in it.,
If you decide to charge, settle on an appropriate price.,
Think about other ways to raise money instead of charging for the app itself.",How to Make Money from Your App," This is the first challenge; as a first-time app designer, you need to make a decision whether it is better to offer it free to gain a following, or whether after spending money to get the app into iTunes, you want to start trying to recover some of the costs and have good reason to believe that people will purchase it.



 


How good is your app in terms of quality, uniqueness, and interest?
What is motivating your decision to charge? Is that reason stronger than giving away a freebie that might attract more people to your website, blog, product, etc., that is behind the app?
Keep in mind that clever marketing can be more successful than offering an app for free; if your strength lies in marketing or social network connecting, charging might be a good way to go.;
, For this, you'll need to consider the unique qualities of your app and its similarities to existing apps. If your app has a lot of competitors, you probably won't want to charge a lot for it or the customers will simply choose other apps over yours. On the other hand, if your app is very specialized and rather unique, it's likely that you'll be able to put a higher price on it.






Test the waters and see what your customers are prepared to pay. You can adjust the price if needed.
Don't forget to account for the fact that Apple takes a cut.

, Other ways can more profitable than charging for the initial app. For example:






Charge for in-app or add-on purchases. This can be an excellent way to interest customers in your app, and then have them motivated to purchase the in-app or add-on items. In-app purchases can be items such as weapons, new skins, or additional content.
Get a cut for the advertisements accompanying downloaded apps.
Keep updating the app and providing sequels to encourage people to continue using your app.

,


As metric data, the general thinking is that for a company, the more followers the better. The ideal number for a company would to have over 2,000 followers. It shows interest in the general public of the company. A large number of followers also tends to demonstrate a degree of consumer awareness.
If there is a huge difference between followers and following where the following far exceeds followers, then this metric generally indicates that the account belongs to a spammer.

This metric can be useful in terms of identifying celebrities on Twitter as they will frequently be ranked highly in their geographic location and will have a graphs with steep incline because they will get a lot of followers in a short period of time as people find them.
The rank for a region may be a helpful number in terms of identifying if your account has the right amount of recognition for the size of the geographic location it represents. Example: If you run a candy store in a small town in South Dakota, 300 followers may put you in the top of your region and you might have good recognition in your market area.

Look for car postings that include the seller's personal story.,
Look for mentions of eBay services.,

Consult with Kelley Blue Book or NADA Guides to familiarize yourself with car values and pricing of specific models and years of cars. To access one of these guides, you can contact a local car dealership or visit the website for each organization, both of which are featured in the Sources section of this article.
Practice extra caution if a high-end car model is being offered for an excessively low price.;
, Many car scam postings will display pictures of cars that have been copied from another website.


Ask the Craigslist seller if they can send you additional photos of the car. If they can't provide additional photos, or if they make excuses regarding not having physical access to the car, it may be a scam.
Visit the links of photos that lead to image- or photo-hosting websites. Some websites will display the number of times the photo has been viewed. If the photo has been viewed excessively, the seller may be recycling the photo or trying to scam Craigslist users.

, Some Craigslist car scam postings will originate from another country so the seller cannot be prosecuted if they are caught.


If the posting originates from another country, the seller will most likely mention shipping methods for the car and will offer to take care of any associated shipping charges.

, Some car scams will provide explicit personal details about their situation or why the car is being sold for a low price; such as divorce, military deportment or relocation, or the death of a family member.

, Some sellers will take advantage of eBay's brand name since it is widely recognized; however, eBay does not associate with or protect any sales transactions performed on Craigslist.


If you have an account with eBay, check on eBay's website to see if the seller is legitimately selling a car. It may be possible that the seller is sincerely trying to sell the car and has posted the car on both eBay and Craigslist.

, Sellers trying to scam you will usually request money wires through Western Union or a similar service that is untraceable.


Refrain from giving out your personal financial information; such as your bank account and routing numbers, PayPal information, and Social Security Number. The seller trying to scam you may use your personal information to commit fraud.

Have good content.,
Consider your keywords.,
Complete your profile.,
Use links.,
Use hashtags.",How to Optimize Your Social Media Accounts," The most important part of any social media marketing has to do with the content you post. Your content should engage and delight the reader and should not focus primarily on selling your products. Your content should help establish you as a leader in the industry. When consumers are ready to buy, they trust you have the most experience in the industry and the right products to match their need.;
, Do you want your profile to show up in at the top of search results? Then keyword optimization is the answer. For social media sites like Twitter and LinkedIn, the space below your name or Twitter handle is great for adding relevant keywords. If you are in the consumer electronics industry for example, you may want to add ‘consumer electronics’ and any other expertise you specialize in under your name. When people search for keywords you are related to, your profile will show up higher in the search results.

, With any social media site you are using, an incomplete profile will reflect poorly on your business. Start with a great profile and background photo. Since this is the first thing people will notice, it is important that it reflects your brand well. Information about who you are and what your company does is important too. If people are discovering you or your brand for the first time, make sure they can easily understand what you do with a complete profile.

, Many people visiting social media profiles want to visit the company’s website after checking out their page. Adding a link to your website from your social media page makes it easy for potential customers who want to learn more about your company. Adding links to your profile pages also help your search engine optimization results as well. The more links you have pointing to your website the better.

, Hashtags can be used in Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Instagram. Hashtags allow you to emphasize important keywords in a sentence or summarize your post by adding a hashtagged word at the end. Hashtags group posts together based on the words people are using. People can also search hashtags based on subjects they are interested in. Stick to a max of three hashtags per post.

Watch for flowery language.,
Do they offer you more money?,
Watch out for sweet talk.,
Be aware that they will always show a sense of urgency.",How to Spot a Craigslist Scam," The vast majority of Craigslist scams come from foreign countries.;
, Most Craigslist scams use a lot of apologies, religious references, rambling about family problems.

, The classic Craigslist scam recipe is the bad check. Offer you more money and ask for some in return.


For example: ""I can't come over and take a look because I have something I need to finish for work. Since the item's still up for sale, please email me your details (full name, contact address, email and phone number), so that I can issue the payment via cashier's check. I'll also arrange for the pick up."" The person then sends you a check for too much. They then ask you to reimburse the additional amount but the cashier's check is a fake.

, They can't meet with you, but are certain you are a good person. There is always some reason why the Craigslist scammer cannot meet with you. That is a big red flag.

, The basis of any Craigslist scam is to get you to act without thinking about it.

Create a website if you don’t have one.,
Search for yourself or your brand.,
Keep your site up to date.,
Improve your SEO.,
Connect your site to other social profiles.",How to Improve Your Profile1," Whether you have a business or not, you need a well put together website if you want to have a good online presence. The first step is creating a website.


You don’t have to know how to code to create a beautiful and functional website for your brand or personal promotion. Many site building platforms offer simple tools to create and protect your website with a little effort.
Sites like Wix.com, Weebly.com, and Squarespace.com offer plenty of simple tools and templates to create a functional and good looking website. Whether you need to sell goods or services from the site or just need a site to promote yourself, you can quickly and easily build one.
Wordpress is another option if you need a comprehensive site that you are frequently changing with products, services, or content such as blogs. However, Wordpress often requires more knowledge on coding backend management.
Other sites like Cargocollective.com and even Tumblr.com are great if you need a personal portfolio to showcase your work or update with blog posts.;
, A great way to know what you need to improve your profile is to see what others find when looking for you. Google yourself and take note of the results. Searching for yourself can be an eye-opening venture into how others perceive you. Take note of what comes up. If it’s links to your site and social profiles that paint you in a good light, you’re on track. If pictures pop up of you partying, you should make sure to take those pictures down.
People who may work with you or potentially hire you are likely to use a search engine to look you up after meeting you or when deciding if you’re right for the job. Go through your social profiles and make sure any harmful content is gone.
Make sure your privacy settings on each social network you belong to are up to date. Don’t share any content or photos that you don’t want to be found.
Create new quality content. If you find something you don’t like when searching yourself, the first thing you should do is remove it. If for some reason you can’t, creating new content is a good way to push older stuff further down in search results. You should create new content anyway to keep your profiles relevant.

, With so much content being created and posted every minute, you have to be active and up to date if you want to improve your profile. If you have a site that sells products or services, you should be constantly updating your site. Add new products and remove old ones. Update your photos and the copy to stay relevant.
Post customer testimonials so that new people coming to your site can see why your product or service deserves someone’s attention.
If you have a blog or personal portfolio, post regularly to stay current. You should be updating your portfolio with new work to showcase constantly. Aim to blog a few days a week so that you create quality content and people can easily find you. Update your photos with more recent ones.
Update your achievements. Your website, especially if it’s a personal site, is like an online resume. Don’t be afraid to list what you do and what you’ve achieved.

, Search engine optimization (SEO) is extremely important to your site’s authority and relevancy. Use proper tactics so that search engines like Google deem your site relevant and make it easily searchable. Write unique and quality content. Search engines will judge your site based on the content you publish. Whether you’re writing product descriptions or blog posts, you need to create unique content that isn’t copied from somewhere else. You also need to incorporate quality keywords. Keywords are words and phrases which are relevant to what someone may be searching. For example: If you were selling handmade purses and handbags, you would include such words in your titles and content. you might also include other relevant information like locations and types of material used. You might say something like “This handmade bag is made from genuine Italian leather and military grade canvas. Crafted in our small workshop in Portland, OR, this lifestyle bag has been designed to be the perfect accessory for any occasion.” If someone was searching for handmade bags, Italian leather, or in the Portland area, your product has a better chance of showing up.


Properly use links. You want to get inbound links from other sites and provide quality links to other sites. You also want internal links. If you’re blogging you may consider linking to other reputable pages and sites as a way of sourcing your information. Like you would in a research paper.
You also want other sites to link back to your site. In both cases, you want to make sure that the sites you are linking to and from are reputable. You also need to use anchor text, the text that holds the link, correctly. If you have a link to a page about genuine Italian leather handbags, your anchor text might say “genuine Italian leather handbags”. Use a keyword planner like Google AdWords to help you find keywords that are going to be helpful to your content. Commit to a publishing schedule and follow it. Creating new content is good. Creating it consistently shows you’re relevant and keeps you up to date.

, Include share buttons on your site to your social media profiles to integrate your social profile.


Many site builders allow easy to use plugins and widgets. These plugins will allow you to not only link your social pages from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn, but to also share your content on social media.
It’s a good idea to place links to your profiles and sharing options on the sides of your pages. You want to keep these links and buttons visible but out of the way so that people can still access your content without disruption.
You can also add a social feed to your website that shows your recent posts, and posts from others who have tagged you.

Update your profiles.,
Connect your social accounts.,
Optimize photos and be consistent across different profiles.,
Remove bad photos and content.,
Post regularly and engage with your audience.,
Measure your engagement.",How to Improve Your Profile2," You don’t have to use every social media platform available. But for the ones you do use, make sure each one is up to date.


Update your photos somewhat frequently. You don’t have to, and shouldn’t change your profile photos every week. But make sure your photos are current. If you have a new photo of you doing something cool related to your business or personal brand, consider using it as your new profile picture.
Keep your bios updated with relevant information and links. If you have a link to an old blog you no longer use, get rid of that link.

, Connect your social accounts to one another to further boost your profile and make it easier for others to see everything you’ve done.


Put links to your other social profiles in bio sections. Have a Twitter account that you use to converse with customers and provide new information? put the link to it in your Facebook bio.
Create calls to action. If you have a Twitter or Instagram following you can create calls to actions for users to read new blog posts or get tickets to an event you may be hosting. Then provide a link to your event page on Facebook.
Use the same hashtags across multiple platforms. Hashtags are a way for grouping messages and topics. Hashtags can help you to stand out and connecting with people you may not be following or who are not following you.

, Each social media platform has its own requirements for photo dimensions. Make sure that you adhere to each one. Make sure that your profile photos and cover photos are the correct dimensions. If someone comes to your page and sees a bad photo or one that’s blurry, that gives a bad impression.
Use nice photos that depict you in a good light, or your brand in a good light. And try to be consistent. It’s not a bad idea to have the same profile photo across multiple platforms.
Sites like Canva.com help you to create and format photos and graphics for different sites and provide templates with the correct dimensions.

, Bad photos and content can be more harmful than no content at all. Don’t give anyone a reason to not like you because of inappropriate content.


Take some time to go through your existing photos and untag or remove these photos.
Go through old posts, tweets, and any other content. Remove anything that’s inappropriate.
You also don’t want to have anything that’s not relevant anymore or your best work. If you blog a lot or write articles, it’s great to showcase what you’ve written. However, you may find that you've improved over time. Go back through old content and remove work that isn’t your highest quality.

, Keep your social profiles active by posting regularly and staying up to date with current trends.


One major way to boost your profiles and use social media to engage with more people is to post on a regular and consistent basis. Update your statuses with what you’re doing. reach out to people and engage with others in your field.
Use mentions, hashtags, and trends to connect with more people. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram allow you to look at trending topics that utilize hashtags. These hashtags will allow your content to reach more people who are both connected with you and not connected to you. Regular posting will also help improve your profile because it will make it easier for people to find you when searching.

, You can use Twitter’s analytics, Facebook's page manager, and third party software like Bitly to measure your engagement with others.


Check the status of your posts to see how well a post is performing. Your goal is to engage and converse with as many people as possible. If your posts aren’t reaching as many people as you’d like, you may want to change the time of day you are posting. Think about what kind of work you do and what you are posting. Ask yourself when you are most likely to read something similar and engage with others.
Sites like Bitly.com allow you to create short links to web pages so that you can track how many times a link has been clicked.

Get a LinkedIn if you don’t have one.,
Make sure your profiles are complete.,
Keyword optimize your work experience.,
Connect and network with people to expand your network.,
Endorse and recommend others and ask for the same.",How to Improve Your Profile3," LinkedIn is the biggest social network for professionals and it can not only help you connect with others in your field, but can also help you find new work.


Your LinkedIn profile is like your online resume. Keep it updated with your current and past work, a good profile picture, and content that you’ve created to showcase your abilities.

, Make sure you've filled out your LinkedIn profile and it's complete so that you are putting your best self forward. You want a clear, professional looking photo, and all the necessary information filled out. Include your education, work experience and a comprehensive bio that gives viewers a well-rounded picture of who you are.
Fill out your skills and ask for recommendations from your network. In addition, endorse others’ skills.
Create a vanity URL for your public profile. Instead of having a number id on your personal address, change it to your name. This looks more professional and makes it easy for others to search for you.

, Just like when blog posting and creating titles that incorporate proper keywords, you want to optimize your work experience to be more searchable. Instead of saying you were a “Blog Manager” think about what that job entailed and make your title more comprehensive. “Content Strategist and Marketing Blog Manager,” tells people more about your job and makes it easier to find when searching.
Don’t go overboard and create job titles that are overly long and complicated, however. You want to find a balance between descriptive and succinct.
Do the same with your job descriptions. Use verbs and relevant keywords in easy to read bulleted lists.

, Join and participate in relevant groups as well as connect with many people as you can.


Unlike Facebook where you might not connect with people who you’ve only met once, you can and should on LinkedIn. If you met someone at an event or party who you think is relevant to your work, connect with that person on LinkedIn. You never know when that connection could come in handy when looking for new work.
Join groups on LinkedIn that are relevant to you. Groups can help you expand your network and give you useful information. Groups you are part of show up on your profile and therefore, are connected to you when a search engine crawls your profile.
Post in these groups and enter discussions with others. You can then easily add more people to your connections and expand your profile.

, Endorsements have tremendous value when it comes to boosting and improving your profile.


Not only will endorsements from colleagues hold more weight, but an endorsement is also a great way to stay connected with others.
Go out and endorse others as well. By putting your name on an endorsement, you essentially put another link back to your profile on someone else’s page. It shows that you are active and might help someone come across your profile and connect with you.

Understand what Twitter is and what it is not.,
Be authentic.,
Interact.,
Provide information other people want to know and share.,
Build your popularity.,
Reward your followers.,
Always focus on the purpose of Twitter as being about connectedness.,
Tweet things that people can relate to.",How to Be More Popular on Twitter," Twitter is an online social networking place, like the watercooler of the internet. It's a place of connection, friendships, and networking. Things that Twitter is not include assuming that it's nothing more than a sales forum (despite the many people who abuse this repeatedly), an obligatory add-on to your company's social media strategy without tending to it actively (daily!), or a place to spar with people.


The mistake many people make is to dive right into Twitter and promote their website in nearly every single tweet. This is a big mistake! You wouldn't do that in real life, so don't do it on Twitter.
The balance needs to be: more personal updates and less leads to things you want people to purchase.;
, Although the cliché ""be yourself"" is a bit overdone, it's highly applicable to Twitter. Followers trust that you are presenting yourself genuinely and this will only resonate where you give of yourself to other people. As in real life, it's important to be interesting, and to be interested in others.


Provide your real name and occupation or interests. This builds up a bigger picture of who you really are and reassures your followers. Don't say anything that would bore your follows. You need them to be ""happy""
If possible, provide a link in your Twitter profile to work you're doing online or to something that tells more about you online (such as LinkedIn or Facebook).
Customize your Twitter photo and background. Twitter followers don't like seeing the standard Twitter bird as a photo - use one of yourself or something that identifies clearly with you. In addition, add your own colors and maybe even designs or photos to enliven the background of your Twitter page.

, Twitter is about relationships and friendships. You can grow to know a lot of amazing people through your Twitter account just by interacting with them regularly, and many will become firm friends even though you've never actually met them.


Be sure to reply to all @ messages. If your name is mentioned, it means someone cares enough to include you, and it's important to acknowledge this by replying.
Retweet (RT) people's information regularly and with consistency. This is the lifeblood of Twitter, the sharing of information through retweeting. It's a form of respect and a way of acknowledging that the person being retweeted is sharing information worthy of retweeting about.
Communicate with Twitter users who are already popular. If they notice you and like what they see, they'll help you in your ""social media climbing"" by sharing your information with their followers, and hopefully recommending you as well.
Leave your Twitter address with comments that you make on blog sites so that people can work their way back to the real you and learn more.

, You'll only be retweeted and followed if you're providing a Twitter-stream that grabs people's attention. Once you've established yourself as someone who shares certain types of information, be sure to keep providing fresh, fascinating, and curious updates.


Include links to interesting stories, news items, websites, recipes, etc.
Also send links to photos, videos, and other visual treats for followers to look at. Cute animals are often a winner as light relief!
Keep the updates flowing at a regular pace so that people know they can turn to you reliably.
If a disaster or major event happens in your locality or country, don't be afraid to switching to it in addition to, or in place of your normal tweets. Share updates and useful information such as phone numbers, emergency information, and shelter addresses, etc. People will readily share this information with your name on it, and you can easily end up meeting many people who are in the thick of providing emergency services, grateful for your support in getting the information out.

Bake some Twitter cookies and share the recipe link and the photos of your resulting cookies with your followers.

, To be popular, you will need more and more followers, people who are retweeting your information, and singing your praises to their followers.


Follow people. Do this as a daily ritual by focusing on people you have things in common with. Use the Twitter search engine to find people with similar interests; key in words that are likely to make appropriate returns such as ""Super Bowl"", ""vegan"", ""burlesque"", ""cheese"", ""mom"", etc. Half the fun is in finding new people ""just like you""!
Follow back those who follow you. Regularly add new people to those you follow, as well as regularly adding people who have added you.
Use automated follower adder tools if wished. If you decide to pay for more followers, be sure that there is a benefit in doing so, for your business, brand, or image, etc. For most individuals, payment is unnecessary; use your time and personal effort wisely instead.
Monitor your popularity using tools that tell you your popularity status. There are many tools available for this, and they can be focused on country, region, topic (such as ""Top LA Tweeters"", ""Top Green Tweeters"", etc.), or other elements you're keen to know about.
Read How to get more followers on Twitter and How to keep your followers on Twitter for more details.

, There are a number of ways to reward your Twitter followers that will impress them and have them tooting your horn with their followers. Some of the ways include:


Use the #FollowFriday (#FF) mechanism to list the names of your favorite followers by way of thanks, and as a way of getting their names circulated. In turn, your name gets circulated when they thank you or reuse your #FF list directly.
Tailor individual thanks to your followers. Personalizing thanks is impressive; it not only thrills the person you're thanking but it makes other followers think you're someone who cares about people individually and this is an important impression to make. One great way of doing this is to pick up portions of their profile and to say thanks by replicating this person's main points. For example, ""My gratitude to @BilbowikiHow - a social media guru with a heart of gold who specializes in horticulture, laughter yoga, & Dr Who memorabilia. Please follow""
Say thanks to your followers in a blog. Make it really special by singling out particular followers for your blog post. Write a small piece on who they are, what they do, and why they rock. Include their photo and a link back to Twitter. And then let them and your other followers know via Twitter! This one is always loved and shows you really do care about them. The added benefit is that your blog also gets greater coverage as followers share it on.

, Any time you feel like promoting yourself endlessly, pull back and remember that Twitter is about connecting and relating, not about selling teeth whitener to your pals. The networks of friendship created online are as real as offline friendships for many people. Just it is easy to wear out friendships by asking friends one time too many to support your Tupperware or Avon sales, so too this wearies friends online. Keep the selling to a minimum, and ratchet up the connecting, sharing, and Twitter loving.

, No one wants to hear about your complaints all the time, so try to tweet some positive things. Also, following your followers shows people that if they follow you, then they also gain a follower.

Determine how to price your auto parts.,
Take clear photographs of your auto parts.,
Gather the detailed information on your auto parts.",How to Sell Auto Parts on Craigslist1," This process may help you generate a feasible amount of money from your sales, in addition to educating you on how much the same parts are being sold for by other businesses.


Call auto part stores or junkyards in your local area. Since Craigslist primarily deals with buyers in your local area, you may want to price your auto parts similar to what local businesses are selling the parts for.
Perform pricing research on the Internet. Browse Craigslist for auto parts similar to yours or visit auction websites such as eBay to see how much others are selling the auto part for.
You can also perform a basic Internet search for the name of your auto part, such as ""1969 Ford Mustang Convertible Top"" to see the search results or price listings that appear for that auto part.;
, This will allow potential buyers to see the condition of the auto parts you are selling.


Clean your auto parts before taking pictures of them, if possible. Clean, shiny auto parts may look more attractive to potential buyers.
Take photographs that display the auto part from every angle; such as the front, back, and side.
Craigslist will allow you to upload up to 4 photographs; however, if you want to display more than 4 photographs, you can use external photo hosting websites or embed HTML code into your posts that link to your photos displayed on other websites.

, Your Craigslist posts should include relevant details about the auto parts that buyers will need to help locate the correct parts needed.


Gather the make, model, and year of the auto part.
Note any extra features of the auto part. For example, if you are selling a car door that originally had manual door locks, but you replaced them with automatic door locks, include this information in your Craigslist post.
Note any existing damages on the auto part. For example, if you are selling a rear bumper, examine it for any major dents or scratches that you can mention in your post.

Tweet like a famous blogger.,
Follow like a spammer.,
Keep your followers coming back for more.,
Ask questions.,
Tweet often, but not too often.,
Use a Twitter client.,
Be funny.,
Gather followers from other social networks.,
Participate.",How to Be a Twitter Celebrity," Twitter is a micro-blogging tool; it's basically blogging in 140 characters or less in each Tweet. Generally, the same guidelines for being a good blogger apply for being a good Tweeter. You can't expect a blog with only three posts on random topics to attract many subscribers, can you?


Choose your topic. If you want to be famous on Twitter, don't take their question (""What are you doing right now?"") literally. It's more like: ""What are you doing or thinking right now that'll be interesting to a certain group of people?"" The theme should be specific enough that people know what to expect, but not so narrow that only 50 people would be interested in it. Start with only one to two primary topics or ""tags"". Then expand as your Following grows.
Find the man bites dog story. Read news feeds voraciously for a nugget you can spin into a good tweet. Guy Kawasaki, who has over 1,350,000 followers, goes as far as paying employees to find buzzworthy stories for him to tweet.Mix up informative Tweets with entertaining Tweets.

Be interesting, transparent and provocative. Share intimate news about your life. If you can spin a good story, you might get readers addicted to the daily dramas of your everyday life.

Network. Good bloggers link to other blogs. Good Tweeters retweet other Tweeters. Search Twitter for keywords related to your topic. When you find an interesting one, hit ""Reply"" and add ""RT"" or ""Retweet:"" to the beginning, and post it. Not only are you forming connections with other Twitter users, but you're also bringing good content to your followers.;
, Once you've got your quality established, focus on quantity. Take the same approach that spammers do. In order to avoid actually looking like a spammer, though, make sure there's never more than a 200 or 300 gap between who you're following and who's following you. This can be handled automatically by various services. Try to keep your followings' number lower than your followers' one-that's what real celebrities do.


HOWEVER, do NOT follow 400 people at once. They will report you as a spammer and Twitter will suspend your account. Just follow maybe 100-200 at a time, then let them follow you back. Once you have a good amount of followers, unfollow the ones you followed and follow a new group of 100.

, There are some basic dos and don'ts that will keep your followers list from shrinking. Use a service that notifies you whenever you're unfollowed. Examine your last few tweets - what did you write that could've turned them off? Keep the following bits of advice in mind:


Do not use services that allow you to auto DM. Auto DMs frequently cost you followers. Some people get their DMs on their cell phones, and an auto DM can be an annoying reason to have to check your phone, not to mention the cost that might be involved in receiving it.
Do not radically change the content on Twitter after you've already established a Twitter presence. People like consistency and followed you for a reason.

, One of the best ways to engage your followers and spark a dialogue is to ask questions. Keep the following tips and tricks in mind:


Acknowledge answers. If you can't respond to each answer individually because there are too many, at least send out a general thanks.
Stick around to listen. Don't ask a question right before leaving your computer. If people respond, you want to be able to respond to them as quickly as possible, while they're at their computers.
Repeat your question several times throughout the day so you get in touch with different timezones and schedules. Make sure one of the times is ""prime time"" when most people are online (usually weekday mornings).
Ask your followers to retweet your question.

, Every time you post an update, it shows up in the public timeline, exposing your profile to people who don't know you yet. At the same time, tweeting too frequently can annoy your existing followers and make it difficult for them to respond. Stick to one topic at a time and leave some time in between updates for people to respond., A client can help sort the updates that you see by user, keywords, etc. For example, you might be following people all over your country, but you can create a list of users in your city, and use a client to see only their updates to get a glimpse of what's going on in your area.

Use additional modifiers to narrow your search.",How to Search All of Craigslist Nationwide2," Google can do way more than just search, and with a little trick, can do a search of Craigslist on a nationwide scale.


This method also works with Bing, Yahoo, and other search engines.

, In the search field, enter what you're looking for—whether jobs, merchandise, or love—it's all the same to Google!

, This will focus the search for information on Craigslist and all of its subdomains.

, You can add additional search criteria by using search operators. Some of the most useful for Craigslist include:


Price range – Enter in two prices separated by “..” For example: “Panasonic TV $400..$500 site: craigslist.org” will only return results that list a price in that range.
Zip code – Add a zip code to the end of the search to narrow your results down by location. For example: “Panasonic TV $400..$500 site: craigslist.org 90210” will return results that match the price range and that appear near Beverly Hills, CA.
Exclude words – You can remove words from your search to exclude results that you don’t need. For example: “Panasonic TV $400..$500 site: craigslist.org 90210 -used” will return results that match the price range in Beverly Hills that aren’t used."

Do not provide financial information to anyone on Craigslist.,
Perform transactions with cash only.,
Verify products or services are legitimate before you purchase them.",How to Protect Yourself when Using Craigslist2," Some Craigslist users will try to scam you by seeking information such as bank account and routing numbers or your social security number, which they can use to commit fraud or identity theft.


Do not submit any personal or financial information to people claiming to perform background or credit checks until you have met with and spoken with them in person.

,


Do not pay in advance for products, services, or job fees to lower your risk of being scammed.
Do not accept cashier's checks or money orders because although the checks may clear initially, they may bounce later if they are fraudulent and the bank will hold you financially responsible for the funds.
Do not use money-wiring or online escrow services because you may not be refunded if transactions are deemed fraudulent.

,


If you are interested in a home or apartment, visit and inspect the interior before you make payments or sign any contracts.
If you are purchasing a specific product such as a used electronics item, verify the item contains all the parts as advertised and that it works properly before you buy it.

",How to Protect Yourself when Using Craigslist3,"


Whether you are the party who posted the advertisement or are responding to an advertisement, meet people at busy public venues such as restaurants or shopping centers to perform transactions.
If you are participating in a job interview, arrange to have the interview take place during business hours.
If meeting in public is not an option, bring a trusted friend or family member with you and tell people where you are going to be.

,,"
"
Insist on speaking on the phone beforehand.,
Ask relevant questions about the item.,
Insist on meeting in a very public place, such as a bank lobby, well frequented coffee shop, McDonalds.,
Keep the cash in your car until you are ready to make the transaction and have felt the person out.,
Make the transaction quick and discreet.,
Make sure you let someone know you are going.,
Be safe and smart.",How to Protect Yourself when Using Craigslist4," If a seller refuses to talk on phone––makes excuses, etc .––walk away. Text doesn't count; you must talk to them. If the seller shows any signs of hostility or anger in any of your interactions, cancel the meeting and discontinue contact immediately.

, Even if you know the answers, make sure the seller's story makes sense.


Is the item stolen? Ask them how long they've owned it. Later in the conversation ask the question of how they obtained it again. You can usually smell a rat. This is especially important if the price seems too good.

, Anywhere with security cameras helps. Pick somewhere you are familiar with if possible.


Do not meet in apartment parking lots, houses, lane ways, out of town, anywhere sketchy.

, Thieves like setups - i.e. someone gets tipped off in the parking lot by the fraudulent seller that you are there and carrying a lot of cash.

, You don't want to flash much cash in public or walk around with showy expensive goods for too long.

, If something strange happens, at least someone has a clue what neighborhood you were going to or who you were meeting with.

, Go with your gut; if a situation feels weird, don't be afraid to bail. It is better safe than robbed, injured or worse - no deal is worth this!

Contact Craigslist.",How to Report Fraud on Craigslist1," Craigslist has a page in its ""about"" section on types of requests to be wary of and how to avoid scams.In particular, Craigslist warns you not to pay anyone you haven't met in person, or to rent or purchase anything on Craigslist sight unseen.Be wary of anyone who asks for financial information such as a bank account or credit card number, or who asks for information to run a credit check or criminal background check.;
, As a Craigslist user, both you and the creator of the fraudulent listing have agreed to these terms.The terms of use specify that Craigslist reserves the right to moderate use and access of its site. If you report the user, and Craigslist has reason to believe they are engaging in fraudulent activity, they can have their account terminated or IP address blocked., If the listing is still active, you can click the link that reads ""prohibited"" at the top of the listing to flag its content.Craigslist is to a large extent community moderated. However, if enough users have flagged a free classified ad as prohibited, it is subject to automatic removal., Craigslist has a message form you can fill out to directly report a fraudulent listing to the company.


The Craigslist contact form is available at https://www.craigslist.org/contact?step=form&reqType=abuse_scam.
You must include your name and email address, as well as a description of the activity and the numerical ID for the post itself."

Think of an object that is not too expensive or inexpensive but relatively popular.,
Go to Craigslist site and locate the country/city you're in to know what kind of items is selling around the areas you live in.,
Create a budget you want to spend with.,
Look through items you want to make money on that doesn't necessarily offer much risks in order to make money on.,
Try to haggle with the person if he/she is willing.,
Buy the item whenever you and the seller had made the deal and gets the item.

,
If you want to sell electronics then make sure it's actually usable.,
After finishing the transaction, make sure to test the item out further just to see if there's anything else that needed to be replaced, deleted or whatever it needed attending to.,
Consider selling the item slightly higher than how much the other seller was selling the product for.,
Consider taking a picture of the item if possible.,
Go to free items section on a regular basis.",How to Make Easy Profits on Craigslist," Such as electronics. Those things are usually relatively pretty popular and can possibly hold the most chances of you earning big bucks.;
, Look through items carefully to see what's currently selling.

, Preferably something you can actually afford to spend.

, Electronics, books, computers, and others.

, Like if an item was a laptop for $250, if the person is willing to haggle, consider trying to buy it for $200.

,, Some people might sell you useless junk item or the item doesn't function as well as it was described, so ask to test the item out is recommended.

, Doing so will help you reassure your buyers that the product is well maintained and clean.

, For example, if the item was originally for $250 and you knocked the price down to $200, then start from $275 and start from there. And try NOT to sell the item lower than $30 for how much you had spent it for or it might be worth the trip unless if that was the best you could do with it.

, Because doing so will help you attract more buyers, rather then no pictures available.

, Quite often, someone might post an item that could be used to make a quick $5 or more. Items that could be sold for some money are like usable TVs, books or something that you could use to fix up if you are a bit of a handyman.

Research your state's law.,
Gather information about the incident.,
Contact your local police department.,
Get a copy of the police report for your records.,
Cooperate with investigators.",How to Report Fraud on Craigslist2," Police will only investigate activity that violates state criminal law, so find your state's law that applies to criminal fraud and make sure it applies to your case.


Specifics differ from state to state, but generally the person must have lied or misrepresented an important fact to induce you into providing him with money or some other benefit. For the crime of fraud, the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person knew the information he was stating was false, but lied anyway to realize an unfair gain.For example, one common Craigslist scam involves fake rental listings. The criminal finds a home for sale on a real estate site and copies the information for a Craigslist ad, using his own email address. When interested would-be renters contact him about the listing, he explains that he has had to leave the U.S. quickly – often because of some sort of missionary or other work in Africa. He then instructs the person to wire a deposit of first and last months' rent overseas. Of course, the home is not available for rent and the person who wired the money will probably never hear from the supposed ""landlord"" again., With a basic understanding of what must be proven to prosecute fraud, make copies of any emails or other information you have that could be of assistance to police and prosecutors.


Since the person is trying to trick you, it's likely they've given you a fake name or are using a dummy email account. However, you still should keep records of all correspondence and any information you've received over the course of the transaction.
Keep in mind that fraud essentially is theft by deception, so proving the intent to deceive is crucial to any fraud case. If the person didn't know the information they were giving you was false, they may not be liable for fraud.For example, suppose you respond to a Craigslist classified ad posted by someone offering to sell her 2005 Volkswagen Beetle for $8,000. In the listing, she states the vehicle has no mechanical problems. However, after purchasing the car you take it to a mechanic and discover the transmission is blown. The seller isn't guilty of fraud unless it can be proven that she knew the car needed a new transmission and intentionally lied about it to get more money from you for the car.

, Go to your nearest precinct or call the non-emergency number to report the fraudulent activity.


In some areas, you also may be able to fill out an online form to file a police report. Contact information for all local law enforcement agencies in the United States is available at http://www.usacops.com.
When you give your report to the police operator or officer, include a detailed, chronological description of all events or communication that took place between you and the perpetrator. Provide as many details as you can and make any documents you have such as copies of email correspondence available to the department.

, Once the official report is completed, ask for copies and take down the report or reference number in case you need them for other reports.


If you are filing an insurance claim or need to report a financial loss to a bank or credit card company, having a police report number can be valuable., As the police investigate the activity, you may need to provide further information to them about the listing or your interaction with the person.


Retain the originals of any documents or electronic files in case investigators need to inspect them or use them as evidence. If you have emails with the perpetrator, you should keep the original files intact, if possible, since emails contain header information that can be used to trace the location of the sender."

, This may not seem relevant, but it is. Some people have many strings to their bow. This is no bad thing, but just remember that employers may not be looking for jacks of all trades, and you may be better off being selective., Write with this target in mind.

, LinkedIn does not restrict you to just one job role, and there is space to add long headers. However, just remember that you should avoid portraying yourself as a jack of all trades.Usually, it is best to add something short summing up your specialization rather than a longer, more general header.

, As this is free-form text, make sure that your profile flows well, is engaging, and is relevant to your target. To this end, it also helps that you keep it logical, engaging and concise.


There is no value in trying to over complicate things with convoluted terminology, rare acronyms and technical speak.Consider adding videos, images and documents to supplement your summary.

, You can use the profile section to highlight a few selected achievements. There are no rights and wrongs in this; it is something for you to consider using. At the same time, if you do include a few highlighted achievements in your profile section, there is no value in repeating them in your work section. In fact, repetition can be counter-productive.

, This section is important because LinkedIn uses this section when it conducts searches.Think of keywords, and key terms that your target (employers or clients) are looking for, and include these in your specialties.
Only list the things that are realistically a specialty of yours. Don't be so brash as to say that you are a French interpreter when you only speak pidgin French. Think of the consequences when you have to decline a job offer because you actually don't have the skill needed.

, LinkedIn prompts you to enter your job roles, companies and dates.


Be selective and choose the most recent and most valuable roles.
Additionally, rather than just listing duties, you are better off being more proactive and including impressive achievements.

, Avoid simply repeating skills already mentioned. Instead, introduce some new, relevant skills and competencies, if possible.

, Recommendations can help your LinkedIn marketability.

, If you do fill in this section, it helps to make them relevant to your target or to demonstrate your abilities in such activities as teamwork, fitness or responsibility.

, LinkedIn prompts for date of birth and marital status. Bear in mind that if your profile is public, which means that your details are potentially open to many people. Do you want this level of personal detail public or not?

, Just beware if your profile is public.

Craigslist does not allow adult ads in the U.S. anymore, so be careful your ad mentions that you are looking for models. Use the term figure modeling or undraped art model instead of “nude modeling” so that it’s clear that you're not running some kind of webcam service or other prohibited activity.;
, Craigslist checks your IP address to make sure you are posting locally. The problem with using your IP to determine your location is that the method is terribly unreliable. If Craigslist gets your location wrong your post will not appear and you will not receive any kind of notification that it is not posted. In fact, you may receive a message that your post was successfully posted when in fact it is not (this is called ghosting.) If your IP address is inaccurate, try switching off your router and switching it back on, your service provider may assign you a new IP address. You may have to complain to your Internet service provider, or even change services, if you are unable to obtain a local IP address.

, Craigslist has a system for reporting inappropriate ads. Sometimes this system results in legitimate ads being removed from the site, though Craigslist claims the occurrence of this is very low. You may find that ads you place in the evenings are never flagged for removal, though ads placed first thing in the morning sometimes are; experiment. If you have trouble with flagging, read the terms of use carefully, and try posting again in a few days.

, This will help you determine how easy it is for job-seekers to locate you.


Update your profile and keywords if you have trouble finding your company when you conduct a search.

Continue to build your network on a regular basis, adding new connections with a personal note of invitation.,
Stay in contact with your connections.",How to Use LinkedIn2," LinkedIn allows you to ask connections for recommendations and post them to your profile. You will see the recommendations and approve the postings. This feature reinforces the information in your headline summary and specialties sections. Prospective employers and clients browsing your profile will see these recommendations, as will the connections of those who have recommended you.


Linkedin recommendations are known for being overly positive and therefore not especially exciting. Focus requests for recommendations on people who can talk best about your skills, such as ex bosses and customers.

, Asking for an introduction to a person from a connection you already know if a fast and friendly way to grow your network. On the free version of LinkedIn, you have 5 free introduction requests.


If you browse the connections of one of your connections, you may invite them to become your connections. Only do this if you know the person professionally. You may also ask your connections to introduce you by sending your profile and a note to someone in their networks.

, You can increase your network and your visibility by starting and contributing to discussions. Local groups will inform you of networking activities and events.

, This is your most visible professional profile. It will usually rank at the top of search engine searches for your name.

All of your information should be current and you should add occasional updates in the space provided.
Members of your LinkedIn network will be notified when you update your profile or add a new contact.

, A good rule of thumb is to only add those connections who you could envision giving you a good recommendation. Think twice before adding connections who aren't too fond of you or any of your companies or businesses.

, Respond to their updates by sending them notes of congratulations on a new position or achievement. The most important connections to nurture are the ones from previous jobs, or other people you haven't spoken to in years.

Know that an up-to-date profile can bring the jobs to you.,

Consider signing up for LinkedIn Job Seeker premium.,
Use LinkedIn differently for jobs that are less specific.",How to Use LinkedIn3," LinkedIn is at its best when you know exactly what you want to do, and just need to find the right people to talk to.

, Spend the most time making sure your profile has a concrete list of your achievements and notes the special skills, qualifications, publications and such that you have. If you have been quoted in the press, have a patent, or have a similar ""wow"" in your background, state it on your profile.


Lying on a resume is never a good idea, but it is worse in LinkedIn. Potential employers can use your own LinkedIn connections to check up on you.
Do not worry too much about filling out the recommendations and skills on your LinkedIn profile. Employers pretty much discount recommendations as being sappy and always positive. The skills are only useful for keyword searches.

, Building out your profile with the right skills can on occasion make highly qualified jobs come to you, instead of the usual other way around.


It is still unlikely to get hit up out of the blue for a job, but it can happen. It mostly happens to people who have specific skills an employer is looking for.

, You can simply go to the Jobs tab on LinkedIn to find jobs that may fit your preferences.


LinkedIn job postings are helpful, and you should look for them. Compared to free message boards, they tend to have higher quality jobs, and it is very unlikely that you would find anything unsavory or dangerous. Still, they are ""just a job board.""
LinkedIn searching is best if you have a specific skill that an employer is hiring for. You may find an employer looking for someone exactly like you.

, Job seeker premium is best for helping you find specific people and/or specific companies. It costs between USD$20 - USD$50 per month.


Job seeker premium lets you see the names of people at companies you might be interested in. Better yet, it lets you contact them directly via LinkedIn messaging (known as InMail.)
LinkedIn gives you only a few of these premium messages a month, so it is useful if you know exactly what you are looking for.
The other benefits of Job Seeker premium are not as helpful. Getting a badge as a Featured Applicant can actually be counterproductive, since recruiters might see it as you being desperate. So, again, better if you are looking for a specific position rather than just looking around.

, If you are looking for a job where there are a large number of people with similar skills (example: sales, office manager, CPA), you may find LinkedIn less effective.


For these kinds of less specific jobs, the key to using LinkedIn is to target specific companies you might want to work for, or use it to find people in your network to contact.

Know what kinds of candidates for which LinkedIn doesn't work as well.,
Ensure your company profile is set up and looks good.,
Post a job on LinkedIn.,
Sign up for a LinkedIn Recruiter Account.,
Know that LinkedIn is very effective in background checks.",How to Use LinkedIn4," LinkedIn is very good at helping you:


Find candidates with very specific skill sets
Target people from specific companies
Reach out to people who are not currently looking for a job. (Passive job seekers.)
Hit up contacts of contacts. It is good for helping find friends of current employees.

, You won't do as well using LinkedIn to find people with:


Very general skills.
New college graduates
Hourly employees

, When you contact someone via LinkedIn, it will be natural for them to check out your company profile first thing, so you want them to find the information there helpful and putting the company in the best light.


Search LinkedIn to see your current company profile. For example, the wikiHow entry is here: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wikihow. Look at the ""Careers"" section in particular.
If the company profile is not to your liking, ask the right person at your company to update it. Your marketing people may have specific thoughts as to the content, so you want to keep them in the loop.
If there is no company profile, set it up from the Companies>Add a Company. You can then follow the prompts to verify your identity and fill out the sections for Overview, Careers, Product Pages, Employees and Statistics. Obviously, the part you want to flesh out is the ""Careers"" section.

, You can simply pay to list a job on LinkedIn without a recruiter account. It is not cheap, but will get you applicants. The quality of the applicants will be somewhat better than what you can find on Craigslist.


Similar to Craigslist, a job posting will be not as effective to recruit people in very high demand.
It will be effective if you have a specific skill set that lends itself to keyword search. As an example, if you want to hire a copy-editor in Sydney, you will find people can find you easily and apply. You have to ask yourself if you will get too many applicants (Salesperson in London) or no applicants (actuary in Marfa, Texas.)

, Recruiter accounts are very effective if you are trying to reach out to specific people. They are rather unmatched if you are trying to find people who are not currently looking for a job.


Recruiter accounts are expensive. The most powerful version approaches USD$10,000 per year.
You can find just the right person you are looking for, and contact them with a ""LinkedIn InMail."" InMails are opened most of the time; much more frequently than regular emails. Some people don't check their LinkedIn, though, so you probably want to follow with a regular email or phone call.
Reaching out to people who are not looking for a job can be amazingly effective in finding highly qualified candidates. Naturally, it will take longer, but you may find better people.
You also will see who viewed your profile, so you can tell which candidates are interested and you can follow up with them.
The hillbilly version of using LinkedIn for cheap is to find the person you are looking for on LinkedIn search, but then to contact them off of LinkedIn. LinkedIn is making that harder by hiding the family names of the people you are searching for. With a recruiter account, you see the person's full name and can contact them directly with an InMail.

, You will be amazed how quickly you can find people who know any candidate.


Check up on the references your candidate provided, to ensure they are who they are who the candidate said they are.
Find ""backdoor"" references using LinkedIn. Search for people with similar jobs at the company your job candidate came from, and you can find and reach out to people who can give you the true scoop about him or her.
Ignore the recommendations about your candidate on LinkedIn. They are useless; in fact, glowing recommendations mean nothing more than the candidate has been trying to get good recommendations.
The skills and expertise section is rarely helpful. It can be inaccurate, it might give you clues only if the candidate is stressing a skillset they don't really have.

Use LinkedIn for reference selling.",How to Use LinkedIn5," In particular, it can help you if you:


Belong to a company that is not well known
Can't always find the right person at a large company to sell to
Are looking for leads for big ticket items
Are selling to companies where nobody picks up a phone any more

,


LinkedIn selling is somewhat limited if you are selling to individuals.
LinkedIn is great for finding leads. But if you are already in contact with the right people at prospect companies, it won't be very helpful.

, The Premium accounts will help you find the right buyers and contact them.


When you search with a Premium account, you will be able to read the full name of the people you find in search.
Premium account holders can also send a limited number of ""LinkedIn InMails"" directly to the sales prospects they find. They are ""guaranteed opened,"" meaning, if the person you are trying to contact does not open the message in seven days, your credit is refunded and you get to try with someone else.
Sales accounts cost USD$ a few hundred to USD$1000 per year.

, LinkedIn search is pretty user friendly, but it still takes a bit of practice to get the right people to come back on the search.


You probably already know who the economic buyers for your product are, but you may not know what their job titles are.
For example, if you want to set up meetings with materials managers of food manufacturing companies, you simply set your search filter to show you people in food manufacturing with title material manager.
You may need to specify additional keywords to get the exact list of people you are looking for.

, InMails are messages sent via LinkedIn to the prospect you want to contact.


Consider hand crafting the message to the prospect. LinkedIn only gives you a limited number of InMails, and charges you for them, so you want to make each one count. LinkedIn fits the VITO letter model a lot more than the smile and dial model.
Remember that putting in a personal note referencing your connection to the prospect increases your success dramatically.

, Since you only have a limited number of InMails, you may want to use other ways of contacting prospects that you can find without LinkedIn. You can try:


Guessing their email address.
Using a lead database.
Phone call
Facebook messages. Facebook also charges for premium emails, but sometimes it is pretty cheap.

, LinkedIn lets you see the contacts of your contacts, some of which could be sales prospects.


Make a list of your happy/reference customers who might introduce you to their friends.
Add these customers as connections on LinkedIn.
Browse your customers' connections. You will find some connections that could also be sales prospects for you.
You can approach these new prospects in several ways. You can hit them with an InMail, do a LinkedIn introduction request (which does not count against your InMail quota), contact them offline, or ask your customer for an introduction.
Note that adding your customers as your connections can have risks. A clever competitor sales rep might be able to see who you are connected to unless you set your privacy correctly. You can avoid this by hiding your connections.

Customize your URL to brand yourself.,
Provide an outstanding summary to highlight your talents.,
List each job you have held with a summary of tasks to provide detail.,
Add all relevant skills to your profile.",How to Make Your LinkedIn Profile Stand Out1," Your profile picture must be professional in order to give a good first impression. If you have use a profile picture that is inappropriate or silly, recruiters will probably remove you from their candidate list immediately. When choosing a profile picture, remember to choose one that:


Does not include anyone else but you. This reduces confusion regarding who the profile is about and draws all the focus to you.
Is just of your head and shoulders. Your profile picture is a small picture and will show your face better if you limit it's scope to just your head and shoulders.
Shows you wearing professional business attire. LinkedIn is a professional site. Wearing business attire in your picture is highly recommended. This includes a nice collared shirt and a suit jacket if you wish (for both men and women) or an unrevealing blouse for women.
Is in front of a solid background. Solid backgrounds allow the focus to be on you and not what is going on behind you.
Has a smile. A smile can make you seem more approachable to those who don’t know you.
Is preferably taken by someone else. It is OK if it is not done by a professional, but definitely no selfies.;
, Headlines are automatically filled with your most recent job title after you add your experience. These can be boring, and you should consider changing your headline to something more unique.


To make yourself stand out, edit your headline to tell the reader who you are and what you are an expert in.
For example, “Operations Executive"", ""Performance Driven, Airline Industry Expert”.

, Customizing your URL allows you to reference your LinkedIn page easily in your resume or on business cards and other documents. It should remain simple, with the best kind of URL including just your first and last name with no spaces or special characters.


For example, www.linkedin.com/in/firstlastname.

, Writing a LinkedIn summary is much like writing a professional biography. It should be brief, yet comprehensive enough to give the reader an overview of your career thus far. Also, it should be well-written and engaging to entice them to read through your profile further and accept or request to connect with you. While writing a summary, remember to include the following:


Tell your story in the first person. This means using the words I, my and mine to make your summary more conversational and easy to read.
Explain your expertise and interests. Use examples to show your value to potential clients and future employers.
Highlight your key accomplishments. If you have made some great achievements in your career, take the time to list these in your summary. For example, Top Sales Award Winner.
State a call to action. Explain what you are looking for while making connections on LinkedIn. For example, “open to new opportunities”, “looking to make mutually beneficial connections” or “contact me if I can be assistance to you”.

, As with your resume, list all the jobs you have held. The difference between a LinkedIn profile and a resume is that it is acceptable to add any and all jobs to your experience section, rather than limiting yourself to what is most relevant to the particular job you are applying for, as with a resume.


Also, you are also not limited to the 10 year rule as you would be on a resume.
Therefore, feel free to list any job you have ever held in your career.
Add a brief summary of the purpose of your job and the major tasks you have completed.
Bullet key accomplishments. As with a resume, you want to highlight your strengths and accomplishments to show you were successful at your job. For example, “Negotiated a $1.5M sale to increase profit margins by 25%”.

, The skills section of a LinkedIn profile can hold up to 50 skills. It is recommended for you to use all 50 of these slots to provide a full look at what you are capable of. This section is very easy to use because it populates suggestions as you are typing and allows you to click on these for a quick listing.


For example, while typing “Coaching” it may also populate “Business Coaching, Job Coaching and Staff Coaching”.

Know your audience to target your profile's contents.,
Use concise and effective wording to create impact.,
Use keywords to enhance your ranking in search results.,
Add relevant presentations, videos and other files to show your expertise.,
Ask for recommendations.,
Use special characters.",How to Make Your LinkedIn Profile Stand Out2," Given your career path and the type of people you are trying to attract with your LinkedIn profile, you should know what readers will be looking for and you can give the audience what they want.


For example, if you are a writer, your audience will be looking for your creativity and to remain engaged throughout your profile by your choice of words and correct grammar.
If, however, you are a sales representative, your audience will be looking for your stats and your ability to sell yourself throughout your profile.

, Just as in a resume, you must keep your sentences concise (brief) and powerful by using effective wording to get your point across.


This means using action words such as: drove, reduced, increased, created, initiated, trained, developed, won, and acquired.

, Using keywords in your profile is extremely important because these keywords will be used by others who are looking to make connections. The more keywords you add that are related to your experience and field of interest, the higher your profile will rank when searched.


For example if a recruiter is looking for someone with “sales and lead generation” experience they will add these keywords to the search field.
To find the best keywords for you to use, browse job openings for various companies and pick out common words and phrases. If you have experience in these areas, use these keywords in your profile.
If you have the experience but do not use the keywords, your profile will not appear in the proper search results.

, LinkedIn allows you to get creative with your profile. For each job or education listed, you have the option to upload a document or file to further illustrate your experience. Adding these types of files is great for someone who produces work of a visual nature.


For example, professional presentations, photographs, videos, ads and graphics.
Be sure to add only files that are relevant to your personal experience and accomplishments, and not something about your company or school.
For example, do not add a recruiting video about the company you work for.

, Having recommendations in your LinkedIn profile is important, because instead of you telling the reader how great you are, they get a chance to hear it from someone else who has worked with you. Once you have made connections with those who you believe will write you a good recommendation, send them a message by clicking on the “Ask to be recommended” link under your profile edit page.

, You can use special characters to make your profile stand out by creating bullet points or breaking up a section and creating lines. However, not all symbols are accepted and translated into LinkedIn.

,


Wade through the many posting titles to find one that catches your eye.
Hit ⌘ Cmd+F or Ctrl+F to open the ""Find"" menu and enter the make and model keyword into the search bar. This tool will only search the current loaded page of Craigslist.

,


Look for posted mileage, a reason for the sale, service history and a detailed description of the vehicle.
Scroll to the bottom of the post to locate photos of the car. The more photos posted of the vehicle (the limit on Craigslist is 8), the better. If there are no photos or 1 shady-looking photo, the seller might be trying to hide flaws.
Scan the post for negative signs. These include cars described as modified or salvaged, posts announcing that the seller recently purchased it or that they are selling it for someone else, and posts with very few details.

,


Enter the car's information into an estimate website such as Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds or NADA. These sites ask you to report mileage, condition and features of the make and model of your vehicle and generate an approximate value for that vehicle according to the information you provided.
Compare the estimate to the asking price of the Craigslist seller.

,


Email the seller using Craigslist automated email address process or call the seller if he or she has provided contact information within the body of the post.
Ask for additional pictures and information from the seller. Craigslist photos are small and low-resolution; request full-size photos of the car.

,


Inspect the car visually, looking for any body damage or flaws that the seller failed to mention. Examine the interior for upholstery problems and unpleasant odors.
Ask the seller about the vehicle's previous use. Plow trucks, retired patrol/taxi vehicles, and racing vehicles are subject to much more wear and tear than the average car.
Check the odometer and compare it to the overall state of the car. In older vehicles the odometer may have rolled over, especially if the numbers don't align or the pedals and steering wheel are unusually worn compared to the stated mileage.
Drive the car on quiet streets as well as busier roads. Try to get the car over 60 mph (97 km/h) to see how it runs on high speeds.
Question the seller about service history and request to see receipts for oil changes and auto body repair.

,


Follow your state's procedure for title transfers at the Department of Motor Vehicles.

",How to Buy a Motorcycle on Craigslist," There are many things to take into consideration before jumping into the world of motorcycles. Ask yourself the following questions:


Do you need a motorcycle?
Are you financially capable to invest in a motorcycle?
Do you have time to ride?
Are you responsible enough for a motorcycle?;
, Safety gear such as a helmet, motorcycle jacket, motorcycle pants and riding boots will help protect you if you get into an accident while test riding a motorcycle. Buying all the above equipment will also put you in the mind set of buying a motorcycle.

, This step is optional however, most sellers will not let you test ride their motorcycle without a CY Endorsement. You will also need your CY Endorsement to ride a motorcycle on the street.

, Hopping on the first bike you see can cost you your life. Not every bike is suited for you. When choosing the right bike for you, take into consideration:


Your skill level. If you are not experienced with motorcycles, pick a bike with a smaller engine displacement.
Your height and weight. Bigger bikes will be harder to handle if you are a smaller person.
What can you afford?

, Use Craigslist's search feature to search for the bike you want. To help narrow your results:


Search the motorcycles/scooters sub-category.
Sort postings by date listed. The newer the post, the better the chances the motorcycle hasn't been sold yet.
Modify your distance radiance. Choose areas you are willing to travel to go see and pick up the motorcycle from.
If the ad posting has images, evaluate the pictures thoroughly. Look to see if there is any visible damage to the motorcycle.

, Unless in their posting they ask you not to, always call the seller. Contact information can be found in the description of the ad posting. Ask them the following questions:


How many miles are on the motorcycle?
How often was the motorcycle's oil changed?
How much tread is left on both tires?
Are there any cosmetic damages you should be aware of?
Was the motorcycle ridden hard?
Has the motorcycle been dropped?

, Don't lowball the seller. This will cause the seller to not negotiate with you. If the seller is asking for $6000 and you are willing to pay $5500, offer the seller $5000. If the seller agrees, you just saved yourself $1000. However, if the seller declines, you can ask them to meet you half-way at $5500, the original price you were willing to pay. Most sellers will agree to this.

, Do an initial walk-around the motorcycle to make sure it is the same motorcycle that was posted for sale on Craigslist. After confirming it as the motorcycle up for sale, check it for:


Cosmetic damage to the fairings. This can help you determine if the motorcycle has been in an accident or not. If there is minor damage that doesn't bother you, ask the seller to lower the price in order for you to be able to fix it.
Leaks.
Tire tread. If tire tread is low, you may be able to get a price deduction because you will need to replace the tires soon.
Engine. Turn the engine on and assess how it runs. There should be no clicks, clanks or any other odd noises coming from the engine.

, Ask the seller if he is willing to let you test ride the motorcycle. Most sellers will allow you to do a test ride as long as you have your CY Endorsement and cash in hand. Check to see that everything is working properly:


Ignition switch.
Fuel line.
Engine cutoff switch.
Headlights.
Turn signals.
Horn.
Accelerator.
Brakes. Check both the front and rear brake levers, located on the right side of the motorcycle.
Clutch. Make sure the clutch lever, located on the left handlebar, feels smooth.

, If all is well, give the seller your money and have them sign over the title for the motorcycle to you. You now own the motorcycle.

, Get quotes from different insurance companies and see which company offers the insurance that suits your financial needs. Some insurance companies will give you a discount for having completed the motorcycle safety class. Have a copy of your motorcycle safety class completion certificate.

, After getting your motorcycle insured, take your proof of insurance and motorcycle title to the DMV and get your motorcycle insured.

Plan your purchases as far in advance as possible.,
Make arrangements in advance for moving large appliances.,
Avoid listings with no photographs.,
Make sure the seller is willing to let you inspect the appliance in person before buying.,
Ask the seller why they are selling the appliance.,
Make arrangements to pay for and pick up the appliance.",How to Buy Appliances from Craigslist," One of the downsides of buying appliances on Craigslist is that you won't be able to specify the exact make and model you want. By planning your purchases ahead of time, you'll have plenty of time to browse Craigslist listings each day. This will allow you to wait until an appliance is listed that more closely meets your needs.


Craigslist even allows you to subscribe to an RSS feed for your search results. For example, you can search for a stove under $300, subscribe to the RSS feed by clicking the RSS button, and then read all new qualified posts in your RSS reader application.;
, When you finally see a listing that you like, the seller will be more willing to sell to you if you can pick the appliance up soon. Find a friend that will help you with the move beforehand, and try to make arrangements for borrowing a truck if necessary.

, An appliance (even a used one) is a big commitment. If the seller isn't even willing to take a photograph and upload it, you can reasonably expect that the sale might not go smoothly or that something is wrong with the appliance.

, When replying to a listing, ask to check the appliance out first before making arrangements to pick it up. This will allow you to evaluate characteristics that won't show up in photographs, like odors or loud operating noises.

, As you inspect the appliance (or in your reply to the listing), ask why they are selling it. You may get a fairly guarded reply, but they may admit that the appliance doesn't work as well as it used to. This will position you to ask questions about the appliance's performance and condition.

, When you have inspected the appliance and are happy with it, arrange to pick it up. Unless the seller has specified that they will help you move it, assume that responsibility falls on you. Communicate with them to let them know when you'll be there to pick it up, and arrive when you say you will.

Prioritize posts with pictures over text-only posts.,

Insist on cash.",How to Avoid Scams on Craigslist," If you are interested in a non-image post or would like more details, contact the poster but do not make any offers until you are fully satisfied. If they don't get back to you, look for something else.;
, Scammers will often download pictures from the internet to use in their ads. You can use images.google.com to search for this. Copy the link to the image in the add (right click). Go to images.google.com and search for that image url. Check which sites are returned and whether the seller took the picture themselves. If the image is original, then it should not appear on any other website, but if you see ads trying to sell the same object in Russia, Nigeria, etc, then the ad is probably fake.

, This is more common for renting an apartment or buying a car over Craigslist. If you're not sure, browse through newspaper classifieds, other Craigslist posts, use the Kelley Blue Book for vehicles, or ask friends for a reasonable price range for that specific item.

, This will give you and the seller the opportunity to meet in person.

, Unlike E-Bay, Craigslist is not responsible for transaction mishaps. This means, if you send money to someone, you can't report it to Craigslist if you don't receive the item that you were paying for. Any reference to Craigslist that says ""buyer protection"" or ""certified seller"" is bogus.

, Fake checks and money orders are common, and banks will hold you - not the seller - responsible. Never wire money to anyone under any circumstances. Most payments made by wire transfer are fraudulent.

Turn off account security.,
Learn how to read forum thread titles.,
Be specific with game application names.,
Enable invitations for the games you want friends on.",How to Be Successful with Adding People on MySpace Applications," The first and foremost thing you should do before advertising yourself is to turn off any ""obstacles"" that may interfere with requests. If you want people to add you, you'll need to disable your ""Require last name or email address"" and ""Require CAPTCHA"" from your Spam settings.

If you have last name/email required, the person requesting will need that information.
If you have CAPTCHA enabled, the person will need to enter a ""wavy"" code of mixed numbers and letters in order for the friend's request to go through. Many people do not like CAPTCHA especially if they're wanting to do ""quick adds"".;
, Many games will have forums, whether it's hosted on Myspace or an outside host provider. There's two common types of ""Add Me"" forum sections:

Forum section: A lot of forums that are hosted off Myspace will have an entire section dedicated to ""Add Me"" threads. Some threads can be about ""trains"", quick adds, individual adds, or dedicated ""No CAPTCHA"" threads.
Specific threads: Most Myspace-based forums won't have the advantage of space, so usually there will be a ""dedicated sticky thread"" on the top labeled, ""Official Add Me Thread"". These kinds of forums will be strict on people spamming their URLs in other places, such as help or FAQ threads. If you advertise yourself in the wrong thread that has rules, you may have things be taken away from you in that specific game, for example money or points.

, When you request to be someone's friend for a game application, it is in good faith and respect to put down the specific games in the summary box. The word ""apps"" is not sufficient enough, especially when the requester has 8 or more games on their profile, certain games aren't on the profile, or the profile is private before accepting the friend's request.

, It is very, very annoying when the person who accepts your request has to rummage through their friend's list on the game just to find out that you have disabled invitations.

Read the job posting carefully and look for red flags.,
Research the company before applying.,
Look for contact information that appears professional.,
Submit only the required documents, like a cover letter or resume.,
Do not apply to a position that asks for detailed personal information in the job posting.,
Remember the Do Nots.",How to Avoid Writing and Research Scams on Craigslist1," Not all Craigslist postings are created equal; some will have less information than others and that is okay. However, it is important to take a look at the information that is there and check for red flags that could mean the posting a scam. These red flags would be if the posting:


Consists of only a few words. For example, “Need writer”. A reputable company would put more effort into specifying the type of writer they need and what you would be writing about.
Has grammatical errors. Numerous errors shows a lack of effort that should make you consider whether or not this posting is from a reputable company.
Provides no contact information. Your only option will then be to reply to the job posting through Craigslist. It is still okay to apply, but if you are concerned, you can choose to exclude certain personal information (like your home address).
Leaves you with many questions. If you find yourself looking for basic information like company, location, title, job duties, etc. it may be a fictitious posting.;
, If the company’s name is listed, research it. Doing your homework and checking out the company will help you to get an idea of what the company is like and whether or not it seems legitimate. Keep in mind, it is not necessarily a scam if the company wishes to remain confidential at first. However, this information must be provided if you are asked to do an interview.


Read or click through their website. Does the website look professional? Is the job listed on a “careers page”? Do you have an understanding of what the company does after looking at their site?
Call a general number provided and, if possible, speak to someone. If someone answered the phone, did they use a professional greeting such as “Company B, how may I help you?” If someone did not answer the phone, was there a professional sounding voice mail?

, If you are looking at a Craigslist posting and can’t find any contact information, or the information seems odd, go to the company’s website and verify their contact information. Be cautious if asked to contact someone’s cell phone or personal email, as this could indicate that it is not a legitimate company.


Search the company website to verify the number in the posting.
Use a phone directory that will provide details about the number.
Take caution when emailing an address that does not seem professional. For example, “kitty345@mail.com” should most likely not be considered a professional email address, until you are emailing Kitty Magazine in the 345 area code (which is very unlikely).

, Only necessary information should be submitted. This generally means a cover letter and resume. A writing sample might also be requested, but beware of providing any lengthy or detailed work without talks of compensation.


If you have the option to choose your writing sample, provide a sample that is already published so that you do not have to worry about the sample being published without your permission (because you can call in backup from the company or organization that already published the work).
If you do not have a sample or you are required to write something specific, ask for payment and put the terms in writing.

, It is not necessary to provide SSN, credit card, bank account, other financial and/or medical information when applying to a job. A legitimate company will not ask you for this information in the application process.Even after the interview process, personal financial and credit card information should not be shared. If a company requires bank account information for direct deposit or SSN, it will be asked of you after you are hired.

, There are some things you should never do when applying for a job on Craigslist or through other job engines. While many posts are legitimate, there are still scams and people wanting to exploit you out there that you need to be aware of. To protect yourself and your assets, it is really important that you remember these Do Nots:


DO NOT provide detailed personal information that is not necessary to do the job.
DO NOT provide SSN and/or bank account information prior to being hired.
DO NOT accept wired money or rare forms of payment.
DO NOT provide more than 1 sample of your work without being compensated.
DO NOT continue to work or provide lengthier “samples” if not paid as scheduled.

"
"
Ask questions and conduct research about the company.,
Seek references if the company is not well known.,
Learn details about the job and pay.,
Know where your work is going and who will be viewing your work.,
Understand pay, pay schedule and process.",How to Avoid Writing and Research Scams on Craigslist2," As mentioned previously, do your homework on the company and ask for clarification of anything you do not understand or would like to have explained further.


If the business and job posting is legitimate, your contact will be happy to answer your questions.

, If you can’t find much information online about the company, or you simply feel like something is slightly off, ask your contact for references. These professional references should be able to vouch for the company you are applying to. Ask for the reference’s name, company, number and email address. Once you have this information, you can research the person and company to ensure they are legitimate.These references could include:


Vendors who has worked with the company.
Partners of the company.
Customers.

, Know what you are getting into. Ask about the supervisor or manager, what the job duties are, and anything else you wish to know before going further in the interview process. If you find that the company doesn’t sound like it would be a good fit for you, or you feel like something is off about the company, stop the application process.

, If you are writing an article or report, ask where your writing will be posted and/or who the readers are. If you are conducting research, ask who will be reviewing this research, what the higher purpose is and if or where this will be available for people to view.


It is important to know what the purpose of your writing is. If you are writing a pro-chocolate report and find out your article is going to published as the sensationalist views of a chocolate-lover in an anti-chocolate magazine, you might want to think twice before sending in your article.

, Know how much and when you will get paid. Avoid any jobs that offer an over-the-top amount or ‘too good to be true’ promises, since they are most likely not true.


Researching the going rate for the job you are applying for will help you to spot empty promises.

"
"
Be aware that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.,
Look for consistent information.,
Put it in writing.,
Do not agree to accept only rare forms of payment.,
Do not submit additional work before compensation.",How to Avoid Writing and Research Scams on Craigslist3," If the job is your dream job, the pay is unimaginably high, and the office is in paradise, chances are, the listing is probably fake. Either decline the offer or proceed with extreme caution.


Request more details on anything you are unsure of such as timeframes, deadlines and pay.
Have a lawyer look over any contracts to ensure you are protected from waiving your rights, lawsuits and/or lack of pay.
Analyze your experience with the application process and determine if you are comfortable accepting the job. If something still seems off, its probably a good idea to listen to your gut.

, If there are any contradictions or confusion with what has been told to you, beware. Inconsistencies are big red flags and can mean that your contact is not providing you with the whole truth.

, Before starting any work, have information placed in writing and signed by both parties. This can be in the form of an Offer Letter, Contract Agreement, etc. The information covered in the paperwork should include:


Role or job description (what you will be doing at the company).
Timeline (when you will begin work; how long your contract is for).
Pay (how much you will be getting paid; whether it is based on hourly work or a salary)
Pay schedule (when you will get paid).
Rights (what legal rights you have with the company).
Termination conditions (what happens if you are fired, quit, get laid off, etc.).

, Rare forms of payment can include discounts, free products and certificates of shares. A company that values your work will pay you really money.If you are promised pay to be sent via a wire transfer, suggest another form of payment as this may be an indication of another scam.

, Be cautious if asked to provide either another sample or additional work not previously discussed. Instead, ask kindly to be compensated for your initial work before starting on other projects.

That's it!",How to Sell Items on Craigslist," After all, if you don’t go there, you’re not going to have a lot of luck selling on Craigslist!

, On the right side of the page, there is a list of big cites that may reflect your region. If you don't see your city there, at the bottom of the list are links to fine-tune your location.


Click on the link that says US States.
You can go right to your city by entering yourcityname.craigslist.org. For our examples, we’ll use Portland as our city, and enter ""portland.craigslist.org."" If there is not a listing for your specific city, choose the city that is closest to you. Be sure to post your ad on one Craigslist city only - posting the same thing to multiple cities is against Craigslist Terms of Use.

, It's on the left side, under the Craigslist logotype. That will bring you to a page that says: '""What type of posting is this?""' It gives you a list of posting types:


Craigslist has both ""for sale by dealer"" and ""for sale by owner"" areas - generally ""by owner"" is for private individuals with just one or a few random used items to sell - if you are a recurring seller, either with an inventory, or you buy/make items to resell, be sure to chose ""by dealer"".

, It features a list of about 100 categories. You can choose one. Click on the category that is most appropriate for what you're selling. If your item does not fit within any specific category, click on the category general for sale.


Since we want to sell out old bicycle, we'll choose bicycle - by owner.
When you click on that, you'll be asked to narrow down your location.

, This is the title and copy and other information potential buyers will see when they are searching for what you're selling. These fields are as follows:



Posting Title: This is what people will see as the heading in their search results.

Price: Obviously, how much you're selling the item for.

Specific location: Enter your county, part of town, or other general information. Do not enter your address!

Reply to: Put your email address here. You can choose whether to have an ""anonymous"" address created for this ad, or not. In ""for sale by owner"" this is generally the best choice, to avoid spam. If you are a dealer, you should list your business contact info in the ad body. There is also an option to list a phone number, and you can specify whether it is a number (cell) that can accept text messages.

Posting Description. This where you do your selling. Make it interesting, make it catchy. If you don't know what or how to write sales copy, take a look at a catalog or newspaper ad you might have, and see how they do it. If it works for them, it'll work for you! If you are selling ""by owner"" be sure to use your own words in the ad to describe your item, you do not want the ad to sound like a dealer/commercial ad. Stick with facts, avoid hype.


Be truthful here. If there are flaws that damage the value of the item, or there's a piece missing, or that your ex will be knocking on the door of whoever buys it—let them know in advance. It may not help you sell, but it will help you avoid getting a reputation as an unreliable seller.



Check ""ok for others to contact you..."" if it's fine with you to get unsolicited emails from strangers.

Check your form. The fields in green must be filled in.

, This is listed as optional, but if you want to sell something, do yourself and your potential buyer a favor, and fill as many picture slots as you can with high-resolution pictures that are as good as you can possibly make them. You want people to be excited about what you're selling. Be sure to post pictures of your actual item, and avoid ""stock"" pictures from the manufacturer or the Internet.


When you're done loading in images, click the Done with images button.
Craigslist allows you to add up to 24 images to your ad. (CL no longer allows links or external images for-sale ads.)

, You want to make sure your listing will get the attention it deserves.


If your listing needs changes, click on the Edit Text or Edit Images buttons, and make any changes necessary.

, When you're satisfied your ad is ready for prime time, click the Continue button at the bottom of the page. If you have an account on Craigslist, your ad will be posted on Craigslist within 15 minutes. If you do not have an account, you will be sent a notification email that you must respond to for your posting to become active.

, You're just made an ad on Craigslist! Note that while you may see a notice that says the list is updated every 15 minutes, it may sometimes take longer, perhaps an hour or two, before your ad appears in search results or in the list.

Ask yourself whether you are comfortable with shipping the item.,
Request that the buyer pay you through PayPal or a similar service.,
Request a cash payment at the time of sale.,
Ask that a buyer pay at least partially in cash.,
Exercise caution before accepting a cashier's check.,
Never accept a money order.",How to Accept Payments on Craigslist," The recommendation from Craigslist is that you only do business locally, and for good reason. You are much less likely to be scammed by someone who you meet and transact with face-to-face. Asking a buyer to stop by your house to pick up the item is the norm (and the safest way to transact), but it isn't out of the question to ship an item. Just make sure you understand the risks involved.;
, If you decide to ship your item, this is the only payment option you should entertain. A buyer can make a payment to your PayPal account using nothing but your email address. Only after you have confirmed payment should you ship the item. If the buyer is not willing to pay in advance, do not do business with them.

, If you decide to meet your buyer in person, ask that they pay cash. Any honest buyer will understand your hesitance to accept other forms of payment and will gladly stop by an ATM to get the cash. If a buyer insists on paying by check or some other form, strongly consider calling off the deal.

, If you meet a buyer in person and they do not have sufficient cash on them, you could ask them to pay for part of the item in cash and cover the rest with a personal check. Remember that by doing this, you run the risk of the check bouncing.

, Even though these are typically viewed as sound because they are drawn on a bank's funds, they are surprisingly easy to forge. It is not a good idea to do business with a Craigslist buyer who insists on paying by cashier's check.

, Money orders are the type of payment most often associated with scams on Craigslist. Never do business with anyone who offers to pay you by money order for more than your asking price, especially if they are asking for a portion of the money to be wired to a third party. This is a classic formula for Craigslist scamming.

Submit the post.",How to Post Ads to Craigslist," The title is the first thing that people browsing Craigslist will see. Make sure that it is both eye-catching and informative. If you don’t give enough details, people may not click the ad to see what you’re offering.


If you are selling something include a few descriptions of the quality of the object you are selling. Make sure to lead the title with the object, followed by some descriptors. Use caps sparingly to add emphasis. Consider some of the following phrases:

LIKE-NEW
One owner
Mint
NEED TO SELL
Works GREAT


If you are listing an apartment or house, use homey words to create a sense of comfort in the reader. Include the basics of the property, including number of bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as square footage.

, The description is the bulk of your post. This is the body of your ad, and what users look to for details. Set yourself apart with good grammar and spelling.


Tell a story. This is a very useful tactic when selling something. Never say you want to get rid of something because you don’t like it anymore. Instead, let someone know that you’re upgrading, or that you need to sell because you’re moving.
Talk up the product. Approach the ad as a salesperson would. Tell the reader why he or she needs your product as opposed to all the others that showed up in their search results. Include specs and details to make the ad appear more professional.

Compare your asking price to the object’s initial cost. This will drive home the value that the reader will be getting if they buy from you. It helps put the price into perspective. This is very useful for more expensive items.


When advertising a rental property, give a detailed description of both the interior and exterior. Discuss the good aspects of the neighborhood, such as schools, close proximity to good food, recreation, etc. Mention any new renovations. Also make sure that you outline when new tenants can move in, as well as rental costs.
If you are offering a job, include the amount of time the job is expected to take as well as compensation. Discuss qualifications needed, as well as what applicants can expect if they get hired. You can typically leave compensation as DOE (Depending on Experience).
If you are offering your services for potential employers, sell yourself. Play to your strengths and list everything that you are capable of (in regards to that particular field). Treat the post as you would a cover letter for a resume. Let anyone who reads it know that you are the best person for that job.
If you are writing a personal ad, get creative! Make your post stand out with witty writing, poems, and more. A unique post is much more likely to get noticed than a typical “dating site” post. Craigslist is a crazy and anonymous place, so have fun and be safe!If you are posting to find a relationship, remember to sell yourself much like you would a product. List all of your strengths, and what makes you unique. Be assertive in your post, and let readers know that you know what you want. Make sure that your personality shines through in your writing.
Be sure to avoid any identifying personal information. Make initial contact through an email that can’t be connected to your real name, address, or occupation.



, Use the Craigslist picture uploader tool to add photos from your computer to your post. You can add multiple pictures, but the first one is the one that will appear next to your listing.


Pictures help immensely when selling a product. If a reader is looking for a physical object to buy and there is no picture, they are very likely to skip over it. Potential buyers like to be able to see the condition of what’s for sale.
When selling a car, make the first picture a profile shot of the car. Use the other photos to show the interior and other angles.
When advertising a rental property, show the front of the house or apartment in the first shot. Use the other picture for interior shots, as well as the backyard and other angles.
If you’re posting a personal ad, you have to decide how comfortable you are with posting your picture for strangers to see. If you do decide to use a picture, make sure that it is flattering and does not violate any Craigslist rules.
Craigslist will soon be phasing out direct linking to external images. If you want to add images to your post and you don’t want your post flagged, be sure to use the uploader. Craigslist does allow simple text links in ads to other pages, so since buyers like to see many high quality photos, you may find it helpful to use a service like photobucket, listhd, or classpics to add images then add a text link in your craigslist ad ""for more images"".

, Craigslist supports basic HTML coding for posts, which allows you to manipulate the text. You can make text bold, italic and different colors, use bullet points, and more. Check out the Craigslist help page for specifics on the code that is available and how to use it. Using bullet points for features can really help buyers understand your item much quicker as opposed to having it all in paragraph form.

, Select the city that you want to post you ad in. Craigslist is separated by cities and regions.

, Every post on Craigslist starts here.

, The broad categories are broken down into 6 general sections: Jobs, Housing, For Sale, Services, Personal, and Community. Choose the starting point that best matches the ad you are posting:


""job offered""
""gig offered"" (short-term, small, and odd jobs)
""resume/job wanted""
""housing offered""
""housing wanted""
""for sale by owner""
""for sale by dealer”
""item wanted""
""service offered""
""personal/romance"" (missed connections)
""community""
""event""

, For example, in Services Offered, you can choose from: automotive services, beauty services, computer services, financial services, real estate services, and more.


Each category has subcategories to pick from. Choose the one that most suits the needs of your ad. For example, if you are selling a video game system, be sure to put it in the “video gaming” category and not the “toys & games” or “electronics” category. This will make your ad easier to find.
If your ad fits multiple categories, try to find the most applicable one.

, Each main Craigslist city or region is broken down into subareas. Your ad will still be posted in the main site for the larger area, but this will help you find local buyers and sellers.

, If you are advertising a yard sale or something where an address is necessary, include it here. Otherwise, be sure to leave out any identifying information.


Many posters use this field for phone numbers and websites. Be sure to include http://www so that it is a live link.

, The price field will appear for posts that are related to selling items. Make sure to set a fair price, and you can include OBO (“or best offer”) if you are willing to negotiate.

, Craigslist needs a contact email in order to create a post. The default email option will anonymize your email, which means that no one can see it from the site, or when they respond to an ad.


The anonymous email only works for the first email from the site. Any subsequent emails between you and the other party will display your actual email. It is recommended that you create an email address specifically for your dealings on Craigslist.
You must put a valid email address in order to receive the confirmation email from Craigslist that will allow you to publish your post.

, Craigslist now gives you the option to put your post on an interactive and searchable map. This will allow people to see where you are offering something.


You can just enter your city and postal code, or you can choose to enter your exact address as well. A small map will be added to your post, and your post will appear when people do map searches.

, Once you have chosen your images, you may be asked to complete a CAPTCHA and then you will receive an email from Craigslist. This email will have a link to your post, where you can make any final edits before publishing it.


Some sections of Craigslist require verification over the phone before your post can be published. This is to cut down on automated spam posts.

, Make sure that you insist on meeting the person in a public place such as the parking lot of a police station or in a café. If a person will not meet you in a public place then there is likely a problem with the transaction. Never meet in a place that is secluded or have the stranger come to your home.

, There have been numerous thieves listing items such as cars on Craigslist that they do not own. Whenever considering a vehicle or other large item purchase that has a high value it is important to do some research about the item first. Ask for the VIN number of the vehicle so that you can look it up on a site that offers information about used cars.

, It is a good idea to have a friend come with you for the transaction. If a friend cannot come with you make sure that someone that you are close to knows where you are going to make the transaction at. Always be sure to carry your mobile phone with you so that you can quickly report any type of incident to the police should it occur.

, Perhaps the best thing that you can do when considering a purchase on Craigslist is to trust your instincts. If you do not think the seller is legitimate, back out of the deal and look elsewhere for the item.

, If you arrive and look over the item and it seems legit, you can go get money from another location. You should also not carry any electronics, jewellery, or other expensive items with you to meet the seller.

Thank the person for the recommendation.,
Check on the status of your recommendations through your profile.,
Keep an eye on your user stats.",How to Ask Someone for a Recommendation on LinkedIn," Once you’ve pulled up the user’s profile, look for the “... More” icon at the top of the page to the right of their photo. From here, you’ll be shown a list of options for how you can interact with that user.You can also request recommendations by accessing the “Manage Recommendations” page directly from your user profile.The more connections and accomplishments the person recommending you has, the more force their endorsement will have.;
, LinkedIn’s updated controls make it easier than ever to manage your interactions with other users without the need to click back and forth between multiple pages.As a basic courtesy, it may be a good idea to send the person a private message first (through email or via LinkedIn’s built-in messaging feature) to ask if it’s okay to request a recommendation from them.You can still receive recommendations from other users without first requesting them. Unsolicited recommendations are indistinguishable from requested ones on your profile.

, Here you’ll be prompted to provide a few key points of information, including your relationship to the user and what job, skill or qualification in particular you’re asking to be recommended for. The site allows you to type your own responses, so feel free to get as specific as you please.Write out a personalized message to accompany your request rather than settling for the generic one LinkedIn generates automatically. This will come across as more genuine and show that you’re putting effort into your end of the transaction.Completing the recommendation request only takes a few minutes, but may prove indispensable for drawing the right eyes to your profile.

, After you send the request, the user will be notified and given a choice of how they can respond. Be sure to check back periodically to see if any new recommendations have been posted.Double check to make sure the information you’ve given is correct, accurate and free of mistakes before sending it.
Pending requests won’t be displayed on your “Manage Recommendations” page until they’ve been fulfilled.

, Not only are friends and colleagues more likely to grant your request, they’ll also have more to say because they’re acquainted with you personally. This will give their comments added weight and make the testimony more meaningful.Recommendations that come from people you don’t know very well will generally be vaguely worded and therefore less effective for singling you out as the best person for the job.

, Be as clear as you can about the nature of the request and what it should mention. It can be tough to come up with a written recommendation from scratch, so don’t be afraid to give the person a few suggestions for successes to include. Spotlight a certain project you knocked out of the park, or remind them of a commission that they were particularly satisfied with.If you’re an experienced marketing agent, for instance, you might ask for a recommendation relating to your ability to build impressive portfolios or adhere to a strict deadline.
To make it easier for the other user, consider typing up a rough draft of a basic recommendation and inviting them to make revisions as they see fit., Your recommendations don’t have to deal exclusively with positions you’ve moved on from. They can also point the unique personal characteristics and capabilities you exhibit in the workplace. Together, these references will paint a more comprehensive picture of who you are as a professional.A dog groomer, for example, might be commended for their ability to comfort their clients while putting their owners at ease.
Because of the time and effort involved, recommendations tend to look better than endorsements, which can be left with the touch of a button., The best time to ask for a recommendation is right after wrapping up a contract or making a good impression at a networking event. That way, your good deeds will still be fresh on the person’s mind. As soon as you get home, follow up with a short message to let the person know how much you enjoy meeting or working with them, then ask directly whether they would be willing to leave a recommendation on your profile.If it’s been awhile since you last contacted the person you’re requesting a recommendation from, take a minute to fill them in on what you’ve been doing in the meantime so the request doesn’t catch them off guard.
The recommendations you receive are timestamped as they’re posted, so a keen observer will be able to tell if you’re batching your requests impersonally., Just as you would for any other personal favor, it’s polite to formally express your appreciation for a shining review with a direct message. Email your contact outside of the site to let them know how much it means to you to have earned their praises. Conclude by offering a way for them to keep in touch for future opportunities.If you really want to go the extra mile, send a handwritten letter instead.Showing gratitude will also endear you to your associates, making them more likely to want to work with you again or pass your name along to other interested parties., LinkedIn’s web designers have recently made it easier to keep tabs on your incoming and outgoing requests. Visit the “Manage Recommendations” hub in your user profile to see everything laid out in one convenient place. When you receive new recommendations, they’ll appear in a list on this page.Review your recommendations as they’re posted and select the best ones to headline your profile.
You can also do things like change the order of your endorsements, which will allow prospective employers to see your most valuable skills right away., Use the tools LinkedIn makes available to its users to meticulously maintain your profile and promote your individual brand. As you gain more experience in your field, the distinctions you accumulate will begin to speak for themselves. This will ultimately lead to more recognition, more connections and more opportunities.A strong profile is one that features a diversity of recommendations from reputable users.
Continue adding endorsements over time to show the ways that your career has developed throughout the years.

, Type the name of the person you're recommending into the search bar at the top of the page. Then click the name that pops up beneath the search bar. This should take you to the page you need., It's to the right of their profile picture near the top of the page. This icon will create a drop down menu that will provide what you need to write a recommendation., You'll see this option at the bottom of the drop-down menu. Click this button. Then, you should get a prompt saying, ""Who do you recommend?"" Type your connection's name again., A prompt will then walk you through the recommendation. You will be asked to fill in basic information, such as how you know this person and where you worked together. Then, there will be a text box where you can write your recommendation., Most people have a diverse skill set that can be applied to a variety of careers. To narrow down which skills to focus on, think about this person's career goals. What kind of job are they looking for? What kind of information should you include to help them find this job?For example, say you're writing a recommendation for someone in the field of writing and editing. You know their ultimate goal is to be a staff writer for a magazine. Think about skills specific to their desired job while writing the recommendation. If someone wants to be a writer, talk about interning with them over a summer at a local newspaper.

, Employers read hundreds of profiles and cover letters each day. Starting with something generic (""Bill is a hard worker."") will not make someone stop to read. Think of an attention-grabbing line that will stand out from the pack while someone is working through profiles.Remember, you're trying to make employers stop and think, ""This is the best person for the job."" Think of your favorite quality about the person and a creative way to convey that.
For example, do not say, ""Bill is a great writer."" Instead, say something like, ""It's not often you find someone willing to spend an afternoon pondering a single sentence, but Bill's has a strong dedication to quality prose.""

, Shortly after your introductory sentence, state how you know this person. An employer wants to make sure you're not just a friend. They want someone who can really speak to someone's skill set.For example, say something like, ""I was Bill's supervisor for the student newspaper this past fall when he was finishing his senior year.""

, Get specific. After giving some general skills, bring specific things your contact did. List their specific skills and how they used them on the job.For example, ""Bill is not just a naturally gifted writer. He also has the patience, dedication, and work ethic required to make quality prose. He's never had issues meeting deadlines and gives close attention to detail in all aspects of his work.""

, After giving a list of some general qualities, zero in on one outstanding trait. This will help ground the recommendation. An employer may be bombarded if you try to include everything in a single recommendation, so think about a single trait that really makes this person stand out. What do you most admire about your contact?For example, ""One thing that makes Bill stand out is his creativity. When I gave him writing assignments other students would find dull, he managed to spin them into an interesting angle. He could make a story about a new parking garage as interesting as an investigative piece about mishandled university donations.""

, Are there any specific accomplishments you could share? Employers are always attracted to concrete accomplishments, often including numbers or statistics. This shows what an individual can bring to a company.For example, write something like, ""While most students put out an article a week, Bill put out about five articles per week. I noticed our online readership went up about 20% the days Bill's articles ran.""

, After mentioning someone's achievements, tie everything together. Talk about what those achievements say about a person. This will leave an employer with a clear picture of the kind of worker your contact is.For example, ""Bill's ability to work fast and passionately and draw in readers is a testament to his creativity and drive. He's the kind of worker willing to go above and beyond the call of duty every day.""

, In closing your recommendation, say something personal. Talk about how you remember working with the person and reflect on your hopes for their future.For example, say something like, ""Bill is very much missed at the paper, but I am excited to see where he goes next. I have confidence he will go very far in life and I look forward to seeing him succeed.""

, Before uploading your recommendation, proofread it several times. You do not want a great recommendation to be tarnished by typos. If possible, wait an hour or so before rereading your recommendation. Looking at it with fresh eyes can help you spot typos."

, You can also choose to invite friends to the event by typing their email addresses on the “Add Guest” field.

For example, they can invite other friends, view other invited friends, or modify the event.

Create sparks.,
Host hangouts to help your business brand become recognizable.,
Adopt a cross platform approach and host huddles.,
Make the Google+ symbol obvious.",How to Generate Traffic to Your Blog Using Google Plus," Once developed, you can start connecting with other Google+ members. This will expand your connections, which means more people will see updates to your blog posts, with a potential for them to visit and read them. Search for the people you know on Google+ and connect with them to strengthen your circles. As you spend time on blogging sites and social web destinations, you can search for more links to connect with more people over Google+.;
, Though it may sound similar, this is not the same as developing connections. Building multiple circles means making one circle for each category. Add people to your circles based on their interests and which blogs they are reading.


For example, you can create a circle for your blog post readers, a circle for blog post sources, and one for people who bring in conversions for your website. Maybe make another for people who publicize your blog posts on other popular social networking platforms.

, This is the next important step for using Google+ to convince readers that it's worth their time to visit your website. Connect your Google+ business page with your home page. This connection will serve as another gateway for sending potential readers to your blog posts. Display your own picture next to your blog links. Include a Wikipedia-style listing in Google search results each time a user searches for your name.

, This is key! If you don't have good content, it won't matter what else you do, because no one will be interested in what you have to say. Search engine optimization does not mean to just keep on publishing links of your blog posts over your Google+ page, because people will see that the content never changes, and will start to ignore you, even it you do add new content. They will see it as boring and you will end up with no significant readership on your website. Remember, you are promoting yourself. For a powerful result from Google+, you must keep your content update interesting, engaging and meaningful for your audience. Adding new blog posts will motivate people to continue reading your blogs, thus directing the readers from your Google+ account to your website.

, Creating sparks does not mean just highlighting your content. You create sparks by tracking keywords in your blog post that are related to the topic of your blog post. Share your blog posts using the appropriate Google+ circle. Your audience will enjoy reading your new blog posts of interest to them. This will help you to expand your Google+ circle because more people will begin to follow your updates. Ultimately, you will get what you want because more connections means more visitors on your website.

, Hosting hangouts over Google+ will help promote your business branding, as you can use it to give a small webinar or tutorial. If you choose to conduct the hangout on air, then Google+ will concurrently stream your hangout here as well as on YouTube, record the video, and then send you email with the the video as an attachment. You can obtain a great SEO tool by uploading the hangout video to your YouTube account. Also include the link to your blog post, along with a short keyword enriched description. This SEO tool can direct more readers to your website, which could result in future sales if you are selling items or services as well.

, The cross platform approach involves interconnecting multiple platforms. With Google+, you can use the cross platform technique to expand your range of users on the Internet. You can use the social media icons such as Twitter, Facebook social plugins, Pinterest widgets, and so on, as an integrated blog marketing effort. Using these widgets helps the cross platform promotion of your content among your readers. As well as using the cross platform approach, you can host a Google+ huddle, which is a text chat between the Google+ members. By promoting this huddle on your blog post as a question and answer session (Q&A session) between the members, you can attract more people to come to your blog post to express their views.

, If you want to get lots of followers and +1's on Google+, ensure that your Google+ buttons and +1 buttons are prominently displayed on every page of your website.

This method is also much easier if you have access to a computer, although it can be done on a mobile device with some workarounds.

, You can do this from a mobile phone, a tablet, or a computer. If you can't find the options described below using a mobile Facebook app, try logging in on your mobile browser instead, at http://m.facebook.com

, Click the small, downward arrow in the top right of any Facebook page. Select Settings from the drop-down menu.

, Access your Mobile settings by clicking the link on the left-hand column of the settings page.

, In order to use this method, you'll need to associate a mobile phone number with your Facebook account, and that phone must have texting enabled. Don't worry: instructions are included below that will keep your number private and spam-free, if that's what you want. First, follow these steps to enable a phone:


Click +Add a Phone. A window should open called ""Activate Facebook Texts.""
Choose your region and mobile carrier from the drop down menu, then click Next.
Text the letter F to the number 32665 from the phone you want to add. While waiting for a reply, you can decide whether to uncheck the options that share your phone number and allow Facebook friends to text you.
When you receives a text reply, enter the confirmation code listed into the window, then click Next.

, The Mobile settings page should now have several options listed, with a ""post-by-email address"" displayed near the bottom of the page. This is a meaningless string of letters and numbers ending with ""@m.facebook.com."" Copy-paste it into another document, or write it down.


It sometimes takes about 20 minutes for the address to show up.Try refreshing your page if it doesn't show up within a few minutes.

, By default, the phone you linked to your Facebook account can receive Facebook messages as texts. To change this, change the new Mobile settings to ""Never text me"" and/or ""maximum 1 text per day.""

, If you are on a mobile device, skip to the next step instead. If you do have access to a computer, log in to your Google+ account. After logging in, click Your circles near the top of the page, underneath the search bar. Once you're taken to a new page, click the large +. Name the circle ""Facebook Posting"" and add your Facebook post-by-email address as a new contact. Sharing with this circle should post to your Facebook account as well!

, You only need to follow this step if you could not follow the previous step. Most mobile devices will not allow you to type in new email addresses, so this gets a little roundabout:


Log in to the Google+ app, then touch the icon in the top right and select Settings. Make a note of which email address is linked to your account, or press Add account if you don't have one. (Gmail accounts may make this more reliable.)
Log in to that email account on your mobile browser. Make a new contact called ""Facebook Posting,"" entering the special Facebook post-by-email address you found above.
Return to the main page of the Google+ app. Select the ""people"" icon on the top right (two silhouetted faces).
Select See more people and pages at the bottom of the page.
Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page, then press Create a new circle. Name this circle ""Facebook Posting"" and press OK.
Scroll through your circles to find the ""Facebook Posting"" circle. Press one of the blue people icons, then Find people to add.
Once again, select See more people and pages at the bottom of the page.
Scroll down to your ""Email contacts"" section and press View all. Scroll through these and select the ""Facebook Posting"" contact. Add this to your ""Facebook Posting"" Circle. Now every time you share with that circle, your post will be shared with Facebook as well. (If you do not see this contact, you may need to wait for your Google+ app to sync with your email.)

, A clear and concise question will help users grasp your problem and answer it more quickly. Be as specific as possible, as this will help users better understand what your problem is and how to advise you.


You can clarify your thoughts by jotting down a short draft before posting.

, Your title will serve to draw attention to your question, and a clear title that summarizes your problem generally will help other users know whether they are suited to offer you help.


A general title like, ""Error in Code"" is incredibly vague. Something like ""foo exception in bar due to baz"" allows users to understand your problem before even reading the details.
If you are struggling with creating a good title for your problem, you may want to save writing the title for last.

, Your question should start with a brief summary of your problem that expands upon your title/topic. Try to explain the way in which you came upon the problem and any limitations that have made it difficult for you to solve on your own.

, Including too much information can get you into trouble or make it difficult for other users to parse where exactly your problem is. This goes especially for code; copying your entire program into your post is rarely helpful., To post a question on Stack Overflow, you will need to log in with your Google account, Facebook profile, or your Stack Overflow account.If you need to make an account, visit stackoverflow.com and click the ""sign up"" link found on the top status bar of the page.

, In the tags field, when you begin typing, the Stack Overflow system will automatically suggest likely tags to help you with this process. Be sure you read the descriptions for your tags. An incorrect tag can seriously limit potential responses.Three important tags to include with relation to your topic are: language, library, and API.

user:username topic (returns only results for the username provided with the associated topic), Often these will be constructive, and by paying attention, you can learn how to improve your Stack Overflow question asking skills for next time.


Leave your browser open to your post, and respond to questions by editing your post to provide more, or more precise, information., To accept an answer that you consider satisfactory, you can click the green tick-mark under the score of the answer.

Understand how to regain reputation if you lose it.,
Ask around!",How to Gain Reputation on Stack Exchange1," Reputation is the level of trust that you gain from the community.


Reputation is based on you and how well-written your posts are post. If you write a bad post, you are likely to be down-voted and lose reputation. On the good side, you can never lose all reputation. You can delete posts and regain reputation, and you will always have at least one reputation point. Reputation is a stepping stone. Without reputation, you don't have access to a lot of privileges.;
, The picture explained it.


If you gain 200 reputation points from a Stack Exchange site, you automatically receive 100 points in all of the other Stack Exchange Sites that you are on. Thus, you will have access to more privileges since you are now an experienced user.

, Reputation can be gained back if a question is un-downvoted, or if you were a victim of voting fraud. Also, if you delete a post, you get the reputation back. However, be warned that you cannot always delete a post.


Accepting your own answer does not give you reputation. However, accepting someone else's answer gives you 2+ reputation.

, There is also a question and answer link on every site. Check it out.


Reputation is tricky, but if you are an active user, you will learn the basics fairly quickly. In addition, you will retain reputation points since you will use them frequently.

, Your post should have research. Make the post look tidy link by hyperlinking all external or internal links.


Even if it takes you several days or hours, a well-researched post will do better than a non-researched post.

, Make sure that it contains good punctuation and spelling. When in doubt of the quality, ask a proofreader to help out. You may even find someone on the site that you can trust to do this task.

, You've now seen the criteria and know which ones will take longer to achieve. It's now time to strategize how you will go about getting badges:


A good rule for new users is to set their sights on the Bronze badges first and work on a long-term plan to get the other ones.
As seen in the picture, the Autobiographer badge is an easy one to get. Just fill out your profile page completely.

, This means you have to consciously do a certain amount of edits or do a task a certain amount of times. Visiting the site continuously for a long time to get a badge will take careful coordination and hard work. You might like to keep a record of your activities, to help you keep track over time.


Some Gold Badges may take years, depending on the amount of time you are active on the site.

, This step will help you identify some easy badges to get you started:


Autobiographer: Complete the whole Profile page.
Commentator: Leave five or more comments. For this, you will need to get the comment privileges.
Yearling: You will need to be active for a year, gaining at least 200 reputation. This is easy, but it involves commitment over a long while.
Citizen Patrol: This is for the first post you flag. Just don't flag any post, flag a post that that needs mediation and flag appropriately. Never get trigger happy or you may lose some aspects of this privilege.
Critic: For your first down vote.
Editor: For your first edit.
Informed: For reading the entire tour page. This will be gained as soon as you reach the bottom of the page. Don't cheat at this and scroll to the bottom extremely fast; instead, take your time and read comprehensively, as this tour contains important info to help you.


This list shows the ""really easy"" badges. It's important that you make your own list, suited to the ways you use the site. This list is just to get you started.







, Always come back for more. If you grow tired on working for one badge, try for another, to spice up the variety for a bit.


Always move forward, or you risk becoming burnt out and not completing the tasks.
Expect to get criticism sometimes. Some will be good. Some will be bad. Take the good with the bad and remember the reason you came to the site.
Getting badges is something you can work at and not really be ever finished, as badges for Stack Exchange are so various and many. If you don't want to work at getting badges, then don't. If you are an active member of the community the badges will come to you eventually, without you even noticing.

, Make a list of how far along you are with your badge. Or, don't is you'd prefer a surprise.


Some features of the site keep track for you. For example, the Statistics link is available through the Review button at the top of the screen. In some cases the ""Review"" Privilege has to be earned.

, You got the badge. The image in the left hand corner of the screen that looks like a bar graph will turn green when you gain a badge.

The host will provide the bandwidth and the chat program for your viewers, as well as the tools you will need to broadcast your game. The most popular game streaming sites are:


Twitch.tv
Ustream.tv
Twitch is the one site dedicated to video game streaming, and you are likely to find the biggest audience for your game stream through them.

, In order to stream your game, you will need a program that can capture and stream your computer’s display. There are a variety of programs available, both free and paid, but two of the most popular options are free:FFSplit
Open Broadcaster

, If you’re going to be broadcasting from a video game console such as an Xbox One or PlayStation 4, you’ll need to install a video capture card in your computer. This is a physical piece of hardware that you connect your game system to in order to record directly from the game console. The computer will then capture the video and audio from your video game console.


This is not required if you are streaming games played on a PC.
Installing the capture card is very similar to installing a graphics card.

, Streaming games can take a significant amount of system resources, as you need to be able to both play the game as well as stream at the same time. Twitch recommends the following specs for streaming computers:CPU: Intel Core i5-2500K Sandy Bridge 3.3GHz or AMD equivalent
MEMORY: 8GB DDR3 SDRAM
OS: Windows 7 Home Premium or later

, Open the Service tab or menu in your broadcast software. Select your streaming service from the list of available options. Programs like FFSplit offer Twitch and Justin.tv support built in.


Enter your stream key. In order to use the broadcast software with your stream, you will need to link it to your Twitch or Justin.tv account via the Stream Key. You can get this key in Twitch by clicking the Streaming Apps button on the Twitch website, and then clicking Show Key. Copy and paste the key that is displayed into the correct field in the broadcast software.
Select a server. In FFSplit, there will be a server list underneath the Service list. You can click the “Find Best Server” button to automatically detect the best server for your location.

, In the Encoding menu, you can adjust the encoder settings which will affect video quality and stream speed. Many programs and services have recommended settings for various types of games and connection speeds.

Start broadcasting from the encoder first.",How to Stream Live Video4," An encoder is a program that converts your inputs (camera, capture card, microphone, etc.) into video that can be streamed online. While a lot of webcam websites have built-in encoding solutions, using your own encoder will provide much higher quality and give you more control over your broadcast. Encoders are also required for more intensive broadcasts, such as shows that require multiple cameras or need high-quality sound. There are a variety of encoding programs available, though many of them require a purchase in order to access most features.


Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is a free, open-source encoder that supports many advanced functions. This guide will assume you are using OBS, as it is the most powerful free option. OBS comes with configuration profiles for several of the most popular streaming services.
Wirecast is another encoder that allows you to quickly interface with streaming services like YouTube Live Streaming. The free version only allows for a single camera input.
Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) is an Adobe product that contains a large number of professional features, but can be quite costly. You can quickly interface it with many different streaming services by loading the FMLE profile that the service provides.

, This will help you determine your encoder quality settings so that your viewers can properly load your video. You can test your connection speed at sites like speedtest.net. Make a note of your connection speeds, as you will need them later.


See this guide for more details on checking your connection speed.

, This is where you will be doing most of the configuring for OBS.

, These settings will determine the quality of your streaming video, and are dependent on your connection speed.


The ""Max Bitrate"" the the maximum speed your encoding will be. This needs to be about half of your maximum upload rate. For example, if your speed test showed that your maximum upload speed was 3 mb/s (3000 kb/s), your maximum bitrate should be set to 1500 kb/s.
Set the ""Buffer size"" to the same value as the maximum bitrate.

, This will let you set the resolution and framerate of your stream. These settings are also heavily dependent on your upload speed.

,, The following are some recommended settings based on your maximum bitrate:


1920x1080 (1080P) - 4500 kb/s
1280x720 (720P) - 2500 kb/s
852x480 (480P) - 100 kb/s

, Some streaming services only allow 30 FPS. YouTube and some other services have started rolling out support for 60 FPS video

, This will allow you to configure your connection to the streaming service.

, There are several preconfigured services available that reduce the amount of URLs you have to copy and paste. If your service is not listed, select Custom.

, Once you start a new broadcast on the service of your choice, you will be provided a unique key that you will need to paste into the ""Play PAth/Stream Key"" box. This will allow the service to receive the stream from the encoder.

,, This will allow you to add input sources that will be broadcast.


If you want to broadcast your desktop, select ""Monitor Capture"".
If you want to broadcast your webcam, select ""Video Capture Device"".
If you want to broadcast from your game capture card, select ""Game Capture"".

, Before starting your broadcast from the service's interface, start your broadcast in your encoder. Once you're sure that everything is functioning properly, you can start sending it to the streaming service.

Study “reddiquette.” Reddiquette is a portmanteau of “Reddit” and “etiquette” that describes a set of common Dos and Don'ts of conduct throughout most of the site.",How to Post on Reddit," Reddit requires that its users register and pick a username before they can post. Visit the main page of Reddit. You'll see a large, busy-looking list of posts with numbers attached to them, plus a row of links along the top of the page.


Click the link that says “login or register”. It's located in the upper right part of the page.
Fill out the required information in the left side of the window that appears. You need to pick a username and a password, and type the CAPTCHA code (sequence of random letters and/or numbers) at the bottom before you can register. You don't need to provide an e-mail unless you feel like it.
Click create account when you're finished.;
, Reddit has millions of daily readers, and there's a good chance that the article you found has already been posted. Use the search function to look for the article. If you submit a link that has already been submitted and is being actively commented on, your submission will most likely get deleted.

, Start by clicking the “Submit a new link” or “Submit a new text post” links on the right side of the screen. Click ""Submit a new link"" if you have a link to an article, picture, or video that you want to share. If you want to ask a question or make a statement, use the ""Submit a new text post"" link.


You can change your mind on the next screen by clicking between the “link” and “text” tabs at the top.
If you are sharing pictures, using an image hosting service such as Imgur is highly recommended. This will ensure your pictures stay available even if thousands of people open the link.

, Reddit provides labeled fields for this. If you're writing a text post, you can choose to just fill the title field in and leave the main text field blank, if you want.


Click the suggest title button to automatically generate a title based off the article you are posting. This is only available if you are submitting an article.

, Reddit is divided into user-curated sections called subreddits. Every post needs to get posted to a specific subreddit. Each subreddit has a unique name and is usually centered around certain topics of discussion. Generally speaking, every basic area of interest you can think of already has a subreddit dedicated to it.


When you choose a subreddit, you can pick from a list of the most popular subreddits, or you can start typing in a subreddit's name. As you type, a list of possible subreddits will appear for you to pick from.
Make sure you are posting to an appropriate subreddit when submitting a link or test post. If the post does not match the subreddit's focus, it will most likely get deleted.

, You can usually find these in the sidebar that appears on the right side of the screen when you open that subreddit. Submissions that don't meet the submission guidelines (title format, content, etc.) will be deleted by the moderators. Each subreddit has different rules agreed upon by that subreddit's community.

, Type in the CAPTCHA code and click submit in the bottom left part of the page. Your post will appear on the next screen. Your post may not appear on the ""New"" tab immediately. This is because some subreddits employ filters to keep spam out. Occasionally, good posts will get caught in the filter as well.

, Posts on Reddit are voted on by readers to determine whether or not they are worth of being seen. As your post gets more upvotes, it will become visible to more people. The karma score of your post is the downvote total subtracted from the upvote total. For example, if your post has 35 upvotes and 15 downvotes, it has a karma of 20.


Text posts will not receive any karma. Only link posts can get karma.
You can see your overall link karma in the () next to your username in the upper-right corner. Click your username and then the ""submitted"" tab to see your individual posts and their karma.

, If your article can apply to more than one subreddit, you can cross post it to other subreddits. After you post your article, create a new submission for the same article. Keep the same title, but add ""(x-post from /r/subreddit)"". Replace subreddit with the subreddit you posted to originally.


Change the URL to the submitted article's URL on Reddit so that the cross post links directly to the original post.
Be careful not to overdo it. If you cross post to too many subreddits, you will be viewed as a spammer and will most likely have your posting privileges suspended.

, Reddit appreciates original content and ideas above rehashes and the same old thing over and over again. Find something truly unique, and post it to the appropriate subreddits. You have a much higher chance of garnering lots of views.


Use the tag """" in your post to designate that it's original content created by you.

, The other type of post you can make on Reddit is a comment on someone else's post. Comments are how discussions form on Reddit. Comments are rated with upvotes and downvotes just like link posts, and your comment karma is tracked separately from your link karma.


You can comment on any post in any subreddit as long as you are logged in with your account (the only exceptions are private subreddits that require permission to access).

, Find the gray text underneath the title of the post that tells you how many comments there are for it, and click that to go to the discussion page. You can comment on your own link posts. If you comment on your own submissions, you will have a ""Submitter"" tag next to your username for the comments on that post.

, Reddit comments are organized into collapsible threads, where replies for comments are indented. Comments with bad karma scores will often not be visible or will be automatically collapsed. You can either respond to someone else's comment by clicking the ""reply"" link underneath their comment, or you can post a new base comment by filling out the comment field and clicking save.


Comments are organized by popularity. Reddit users click the up and down arrows to the left of each post to either “upvote” or “downvote” it. If your post is popular, it will move up towards the top of the list.

, If you have a lot of information to convey in your comment, it will be helpful to everyone else if you take some time to format it so that it is not just a wall of text. Ensure that your paragraphs are distinct and not too long, and use some comment coding to make things stand out.


*italics* - italics

**bold** - bold

(http://example.com) - linkname
> quoted text - quoted text

To start a new line, use two spaces at the end of the first line. To start a new paragraph, use a double line break.

, These rules govern posting everywhere on Reddit. They are fairly simple.


Don't post any sexual content featuring children or minors. This includes suggestive content.
Don't spam. Spamming is the practice of rapidly posting the same thing over and over again, or filling up posts with repeated information.
Don't try to affect how people vote on your posts. Everything from begging to asking politely is forbidden.
Don't post personal information. This includes your own information and that of others.
Don't damage or interfere with the site itself.

, Subreddits are governed by their own secondary rules underneath Reddit's global rule set. Most of these are written as content restrictions.


To learn the specific rules for a subreddit, check the right side of the main page of that subreddit. Rules are clearly listed there.
Breaking subreddit rules won't get you in serious trouble with the site, but it can get you and your post(s) removed from that subreddit. It will also irritate other users of the subreddit.

, Some of the more important pieces of reddiquette include:


Remember that the person you are communicating with is a human. Other commenters and posters are human just like you. Consider if you would say if you confronted with this person face to face before posting.
Vote on other users comments and submissions. Make sure that you only use the downvote option for content or comments that don't fit the subreddit or don't add anything to the conversation. Don't downvote because you don't agree with the other person.
Make thoughtful posts, stay abreast of new posts, and link to outside sources responsibly. Meaning contribute to the conversation at hand in a meaningful manner. Redditors do not take kindly to blatant spam or self promotion. If you are upfront about what your link is, and it contributes to the conversation and is applicable, then by all means post. Blatant self promotion or attempts to garner traffic usually are not met with favorably.
Let people know why you edited your comment. It is common courtesy to explain why your post has been edited, as everyone can see which posts have been edited.
Don't be intentionally rude. Reddit strives to foster an active community, and rudeness undermines that.Don't start or participate in trolling and flame wars, which are attacks on other users without contributing to the discussion.

Look through some of your favorite sites to see if they have any RSS feeds. Chance are that they might, or have ways to find ways to find their RSS feeds if they aren't shown to the user at first. They might have a page that lists some of the feeds they host.
Look through the website's source code. Although most RSS readers will trigger from reading this line, if the source code has errors, the reader won't trigger the link and you'll have to dig a little to find it. You might find them in a line similar to<link rel=""alternate"" type=""application/rss+xml"" title=""RSS Feed"" href=""http:.

It can be anything as long as it is related to your chosen niche. The more specific the better, that way you`ll be able to target targeted buyers. For example, I am in the niche, I have a Diet pill product that I intend to sell and naturally my target keyword would be “DIET”.;
, With Google Keywords Tool, you`ll be able to see how much competition your keyword has. The less the better, but you need at least a mere amount of competition to know that there is something there to compete with! If you are comfortable with the amount of traffic your chosen keyword receives, then go for it. If not, then I strongly recommend you change it, you can take some ideas from the `relative keywords` that appear along. Don`t go over 4,000,000 in competition, instead if you are just starting out then look for keywords with competition less than 2,000,000. That way you`d see your article in the first page in no time.

, Take a look at the keywords in the search results; you need to take note of the first 10 keywords in that search. Choose only the ones relative. Don`t go overboard. Better yet, choose the keywords that are most relative and strongly related to your targeted keyword and ones that you can put together in writing.

, Take a look at your targeted keyword as well as your chosen 10 keywords. Head over to ezinearticles.com and choose one very relative article that relates to your niche or product. Extract the ideas from it. Head back to your keywords and write a brand new article with all, not all of course but most of the keywords you have. You have to make sense otherwise the article won`t be as valuable as it ought to be to succeed with attracting traffic.

,, Submit it to Social Monkee and SocialAdr to get it indexed fast. For this, all you need to do is type in a title, a description and a list of keywords (here you can simple copy-paste the keywords you want to target ).

, After a few hours, check if your site has been indexed or not , this is very important, you want the search engines to detect that the article originally is published is on your site. That way when you distribute your article to other sites, Google will know that these article directories are simply backlinks linking to YOUR site. The more the better.

, The directories will publish them, no worries for duplicate problems because after all you are the official owner of the article and the search engines know that. Submit your article to the following directories, they come highly ranked in the search engines, EzineArticles, GoArticles, ArticleBase and SooperArticles.

, Once you submit your article to a few sites, Google will consider these direct links as backlinks to your site. Eventually, day after day and you will notice a massive transition with your sites` ranking and receive a ton of traffic.

Understand the Tor network.,
Download the Tor Browser.,
Protect your anonymity.,
Start with a deep web introduction from the ""surface web"" communities for up-to-date instructions and advice.,Use a deep web search engine.,Use specialized deep web services.,Talk to deep web denizens.",How to Search the Deep Web2," This area of the deep web, sometimes called the Dark Net, is used for trades, conversations, and information that users want to keep private.Visitors must use software called Tor to access this region of the web, visiting websites with the "".onion"" domain. While much of this activity is illegal or legally grey, this is also an area used by journalists to talk to anonymous sources, and by people interested in the concept of an ultra-private internet.


Accessing this area of the deep web is legal, although that may not apply to activities you participate in there.

, Tor is a free service that lets you connect to web pages anonymously, making it extremely difficult for anyone to track your internet activity if you follow the right precautions. Many deep web communities can only be accessed through the Tor network, since they are founded on anonymity, privacy, and secrecy. Download the Tor Browser here to begin accessing this network.


Web pages on the Tor network tend to be unreliable, often going down for hours, days, or permanently. They can be slow to load as well, since Tor is routing your connection through other people's computers to protect your anonymity.
While Tor browsers exist for Android and iOS, these are not secure and not recommended.Similarly, Tor add-ons for other browsers are not secure and are usually not supported by the Tor organization.

, Accessing the deep web tor network is legal, but many people take advantage of the anonymity to engage in illegal activity. Taking these precautions is highly recommended to avoid malicious attacks or tracking by law enforcement agencies:


Click the ""S"" logo to the left of the Tor Browser address bar, and click ""Forbid scripts globally.""Turn on your windows or Mac firewall.
Never download any file from a Tor web page, not even a .pdf or .doc file. Torrent-sharing is especially insecure.

, Try posting on the subreddits /r/deepweb, /r/onions, or /r/Tor.


Most of the deep web links in this section are only accessible through Tor, not ordinary browsers.

, The deep web is intentionally difficult to explore and maintain, so these search engines may not be as effective as you are used to on the ordinary internet. In order to find a variety of results, try using several of them for each search, such as Torch (http://xmh57jrzrnw6insl.onion/) and TorSearch (http://kbhpodhnfxl3clb4.onion/).


If you're looking for a well-known deep web site, even a mainstream search engine like google can often find a link., While the deep web is infamous for illegal activity, there are legitimate sites as well. Some are based on familiar concepts, like image sharing (e.g., http://www.zw3crggtadila2sg.onion/imageboard/). Others are more unique to deep web culture, such as secure whistleblowing sites (e.g., http://5r4bjnjug3apqdii.onion/) and eBook collections focused on subversive works (e.g., https://xfmro77i3lixucja.onion.lt/).


, This area of the deep web loses major websites constantly, partly due to crackdowns on illegal activity, and partly because many of the websites are run by individuals or small teams without any funding. To find out the latest replacements or hot spots, talk to people using OnionChat (http://www.chatrapi7fkbzczr.onion/).

If you already have a Google account for your business, it is recommended to use that. If you only have a personal account, follow these instructions to make a new one for your business.;
, This is a built-in tool for AdWord users, and so you don't need to make a new account once you've set up Google AdWord. Just go to the correct website and sign in.


Go to the ""Tools"" bar in your Google Adwords account, and click on ""Keyword Planner."" This will take you to the Keyword Planner page.
Alternatively, from your web browser, type in https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner, then click on the blue ""Sign into AdWords"" button.

, Google Keyword Planner is a powerful tool, and you will be shown a menu with four options:


Search for new keyword and ad group ideas
Get search volume for a list of keywords or group them into ad groups
Get traffic forecasts for a list of keywords
Multiply keyword lists to get new keyword ideas

, This will bring up several other menus, including ""your product or service,"" ""your landing page,"" and ""your product category."" All of these categories are important to getting the tool to work for you, so be careful what you input here.

, This is one of the most important steps, and will make or break your search. Think hard about what your business is and what it provides, and then, how you want to maximize your business. After you have done so, pick the top keywords that come to mind, and put them in the ""product or service"" window.


Contrary to the suggested entries, you don't want to put something really general like ""used cars"" into this window, because then you will only receive a list of very general head keywords.
Instead of entering vague words, try to enter more targeted keywords. If you're in the used car business for example, instead of ""used cars"" enter ""used cars in Los Angeles"" or ""used Volkswagen cars."" Whatever words that pertain to your business and will make the best use of this tool, you should use. Do some experimentation.

, This tool checks your landing page for any keywords useful for your advertising campaign. As such, if you are looking for keywords, and not trying to optimize your campaign, this tool should be avoided.


This service is primarily for users of Google AdWords, and so will likely be of little utility to you.
However, if you desire to find some good keywords for your business, putting up a home page, or any other page, from your site probably won't hurt.

, You have the option to choose target country, language, and search engine, and so this is an incredibly important tool if you do business abroad or are based in a country outside the United States.


If your business is to ship denim to Europe, there isn't much use in you choosing the United States or Asia as your targets. Like with the other windows, you need to know exactly what your business does before choosing how to maximize your keywords.
Your targets are automatically set to target people in the United States, searching on Google, who speak English. If this is not your target audience, make sure to switch them to the appropriate targets.
There is also a ""negative keywords"" tool, which does not target certain keywords in an advertising campaign. Unless you are using Google AdWords, this will be of little utility to you.

, You are also able to filter your keywords by frequency of appearance in search engines, by how much customers are willing to spend on certain searched items, and by how wide a net you want your search to cast. You can also include or exclude certain keywords.


The keyword filter allows you to remove keywords that you don't need. For example, if you want to ship denim to high-value Asian markets, you won't want keywords that show up only once or twice; you want keywords that show up many times. You can filter for keywords that only show up more than or less than a certain number to come up with the exact words you need.
Keyword options, like ""hide keywords in my account,"" are mostly for Google AdWords campaigners, and so can be avoided.
You may already be searching for certain keywords, and don't want these results to skew past results. Or, you may be getting a lot of crosstalk in your results, and want to eliminate certain pesky keywords. Regardless of intent, you can add these keywords to the ""include"" or ""exclude"" window.

, This will pull up your Keywords Results Page. Read to the very end to see how to use this, as each tool will bring up the Keywords Results Page.

, This is a useful feature if you know the keywords you want to search for, and are only interested in knowing their search volume. If you want to discover new keywords, use the ""search for new keyword and ad group ideas"" tool instead.

, Compile all the keywords you want to search for, and then upload them in this window. There are two ways to do this.


Copy and paste your list of keywords into the ""enter keywords"" window
Upload a CSV file of all your desired keywords by hitting the ""Browse"" button under ""Option 2: Upload file.""

, Like in ""search for new keyword and ad group ideas,"" you have the option to choose target country, language, and search engine, and so this is an incredibly important tool if you do business abroad or are based in a country outside the United States.


Like with the other windows, you need to know exactly what your business does before choosing how to target your keywords to certain audiences
Your targets are automatically set to target people in the United States, searching on Google, who speak English. If this is not your target audience, make sure to switch them to the appropriate targets.
There is also a ""negative keywords"" tool, which does not target certain keywords in an advertising campaign. Unless you are using Google AdWords, this will be of little utility to you.

, This will bring up the Keywords Results Page, and show how many people have searched for the keywords you are interested in. This article will deal with how to understand the Keywords Results Page in the last section.

, This is useful for combining your list of keywords into countless possible combinations, most of which will be useless. However, some will also provide good material. It is especially useful for seeing how actual people may search for your product in any number of ways.


The two or more columns you place words in will provide the keyword combinations.
Remember that most of your results will be useless gibberish.

,

,

, By clicking on the grey ""X"" next to the second list, you can add one new columns for larger potential keyword combinations.

, Like in the previous two tools, you have the option to choose target country, language, and search engine, and so this is an incredibly important tool if you do business abroad or are based in a country outside the United States.


Like with the other windows, you need to know exactly what your business does before choosing how to target your keywords to certain audiences
Your targets are automatically set to target people in the United States, searching on Google, who speak English. If this is not your target audience, make sure to switch them to the appropriate targets.
There is also a ""negative keywords"" tool, which does not target certain keywords in an advertising campaign. Unless you are using Google AdWords, this will be of little utility to you.

, This will bring up all the results for your query on the Keywords Results Page. This article deals with how to interpret the page in the next part.

, There are multiple elements of this page it will behoove you to know, as all of them are rich potential sources for keyword research.


Ad group ideas. This tab shows all the potential ad groups, as well as the keywords that apply to them.
Keyword ideas. This tab shows the search parameters you entered earlier: the keywords, their relevance, average monthly searches, and a graphic representation of those searches.
Lefthand sidebar. This just holds the filtering, targeting, and other parameters you set when you began the search. If you want to edit your search parameters from here, it is possible to do so by clicking on the translucent grey pencil icons in each box.

, The ad groups come up depending on which keywords you entered, and can be used to discover new keywords or new potential markets.


Clicking on the name of each ad group will pull up the keywords that apply to it, sorted in order of relevance. Many of the keywords that show up here will apply only to the ad group, and so were not included in your original search, making this a good source for keyword research in its own right.
The sheer number of ad groups that may apply to your keywords means that you may fine new, niche markets you had not thought of yet to market your product to.
Hit the download button in the upper right corner to download a file of the ad groups and keywords to your computer for further research.

, This pulls up only the keywords, without the ad groups that they apply to. There is an almost bewildering number of factors to consider in this tab, but there are three important factors you should always look at:


Search volume. A high search volume for your chosen keyword means a more useful keyword for your advertising.
Competition. High competition generally means that there are a lot of consumers that companies need to compete for, which means a higher monetization rate for your advertising campaigns.
Suggested bid. The higher the suggested bid, the higher your potential earnings from your advertising campaign.

When you first go to 'Google.com', you don't see much.,
The ""one or more of these words"" box let's you look up something or something else instead but it won't find the two search terms together.,

",How to Use Google Advanced Search Tricks," It looks like a very simple search engine. In actuality it is but it can be used for much more. Over to the right of the search box, there are three links: Advanced Search, Preferences, and Language Search.


Advanced Search - If you press Advanced Search, a page comes up with many different options.
In the box labeled ""All these words"" is your standard search box like the one on the front page.
The box ""this exact wording or phrase"" doesn't contain words in the middle of a sentence. It will surround the words with quotes """". For example, if you type in ""wikiHow is Awesome"" in the this exact wording or phrase box, the search won't include a page with ""Is wikiHow useful? Many people asked do think it is useful and awesome"" but will include ""wikiHow is Awesome. This is why I think so."";
, For instance, you could search with the box ""Chicken OR Gravy"" the search would include pages about chicken and others about gravy.

, This box lets you not include certain words in your search. This box puts a - before the word. For example, if you search for ""Bass"" as in the fish, you could type in ""Bass -Sing"" to find pages that have Bass in them and not about singing.

, This option isn't very necessary. If you search an English word, then you will probably get English.
""File Type"" let's you select which kind of file you want the search result to be. So if you want to find .pdf files then you would select Adobe Acrobat PDF.
""Search within a site or domain"" lets you search inside a certain website or a extension like "".edu""

Enter search terms.,
Get citation information.,
Go to the full text, if possible.",How to Use Google Scholar1," Open your preferred internet browser, and go to http://scholar.google.com to visit Google Scholar. You will see a webpage that looks much like the regular Google Search page, with the Google Scholar logo and a search box underneath.


You can access Google Scholar via a computer or a mobile device.The Google Chrome browser also has a Google Scholar Button you can add to make searching easier.;
, To access some of Google Scholar’s services and features, you’ll want to be logged into your Google account (it’s easy to set up one if you haven’t already). Just click “Sign In” in the top right corner of the Google Scholar webpage and follow the prompts. This will link your use of Google Scholar to your Gmail and other Google accounts.

, Click “Settings” at the top center of the Google Scholar webpage, then “Library Links” on the left-hand menu bar. Type in the name of your institution and follow the prompts to log in. Many sources Google Scholar finds have restricted access, but if you have access to a library or other institution that subscribes to the right services, you may be able to reach these.

, In the search box, type the key terms for topic you are searching for. Then, click the search button (to the right of the search bar, with a magnifying glass icon) to pull up results.


For instance, if you are interested in Vietnamese culture, you could type in ‘the culture of the Vietnamese people.’
Generally, however, using as few search terms as possible will return broader results. For instance, you could also just search for ‘Vietnamese people’ or ‘Vietnamese culture.’
If you are having trouble finding relevant results, try an additional or different set of search terms. For instance, if you are interested in the everyday life of Vietnamese people, and ‘Vietnamese people’ isn’t returning useful results, try searching for ‘Vietnamese people customs.’
Google Scholar allows you to look for articles and other scholarly sources (including patents) as well as case law (if you are doing legal research). Just click the circular radio button (found below the search bar) corresponding to the type of search you want to do.

, A search in Google Scholar may return a variety of results: academic articles, books, dissertations and theses, etc. Pay attention to titles, author names, publication dates, and other information that Google Scholar will supply. Keep an eye out for results that seem interesting or relevant to your topic.


For example, if you search for ‘Vietnamese Culture,’ you might see a result for the article “Culture Shock: A Review of Vietnamese Culture and its Concepts of Health and Disease,” and see that it is by M.D. Nguyen, and was published in the Western Journal of Medicine in 1985.
You might be interested in the specific topic (Vietnamese culture and health), or the author, or the fact that it was published in 1985.
You might also be able to see a brief abstract or snippet of text from the result, which can help you determine if it is relevant to your search.

, Some results found via Google Scholar will be full text, meaning you can click on the title of the result and go directly to read the full article, book, or other source via your web browser. Many academic sources however, have restricted access and do not allow the general public to see the full text.Clicking on a search result might take you to the full text, an abstract, a snippet, or a limited preview.
If you are logged into your institutional account, Google Scholar may provide links for full-text access. If you are logged into your Harvard account, for instance, look for “Availability at Harvard” and/or “FindIt@Harvard” for more information about whether or not you can access the full text of particular sources.
If you don’t have an institutional or library account, some restricted sources may have the option of paying a fee to view them.
If a source you want to view is restricted, you can also click “All Versions” at the bottom of the citation information. If the source is accessible via other databases, you might be able to find one that is non-restricted.

, Formatting your search in different ways will affect the results that you receive. Try to keep your search terms simple to get the best results. Search using the important words, and leave out the question. The “I'm Feeling Lucky” button will take you directly to the first search result.


Try to use words that the websites that you are looking for will use. For example, if your tooth is hurting, search “toothache” as opposed to “my tooth hurts”. This will result in more informative websites.
If you need a precise result for your search, put quotations mark around it. This will make Google only search for the exact word or phrase in the quotes.

For example, if you entered chocolate cookies, without quotes, Google would find any pages containing the word “chocolate” or the word “cookies” (but pages with both words do end up higher in the results). If you put “chocolate cookies” in the search it would search only for pages that contain that exact phrase.


Exclude a word from a search by using a dash. Put the dash in front of the word that you want to exclude. This will allow you to remove unwanted search result.
Enter equations to see the calculated result as the first entry. This will open the calculator tool in Google, which you can use to enter new equations.
Enter units to be converted to have Google tell you the conversion. For example, enter 1 cup = ounces and the conversion will be displayed before website search results. You can then use the pull-down menus to change units.
Most punctuation is ignored during a Google search.

, Once you’ve entered your search, you can narrow down the results by clicking on the tabs at the top of the results list.


Web shows websites. This is the default tab.
Images shows a list of images that correspond to your search. If your search result matches a lot of images, the most popular ones will be displayed as a search result in the Web tab.
Maps shows your search result on a map. Usually when you enter a location into the search, a map will appear in the Web tab.
The shopping tab will show products available in your area or online that relate to your search.
Blogs will show any blog posts that relate to your search.
You can click the More tab to search through other Google services, such as the Play Store, Recipes, and more.

, You can add specific parameters to your search by opening the Advanced Search tool. You can open this by scrolling to the bottom of the search results and clicking the Advanced Search link.


In the “Find pages with…” section, you can specify exactly how you want Google to search for your terms. These can be achieved through the regular search box as well, and the instructions are listed beside each entry.
In the “Then narrow your results by…” section, you can add filters that will hide results that aren’t relevant to you. You can set the desired language, region, update date, specific site, and more. For example, you could search for only French YouTube videos uploaded this year.

, Click the red Sign In button in the top-right corner to sign in with your Google account. This will help tailor searches to you as well as allow you to save your searching preferences. If you see your name and picture in the top-right corner, you are successfully signed in.

Try an advanced search.,
Use Boolean search connectors.,
Restrict your search using other commands.,
Check the “Related articles” to find similar results.,
Click “cited by” to get a sense of a source’s impact.",How to Use Google Scholar2," If you aren’t happy with the search results, or if you have a more specific idea of what you are searching for, you can try Google Scholar’s advanced search options. These options allow you to do things like search for results within a certain date range, find results in a certain language, order the results from most recent to oldest, and look for articles written by a particular author or published in a particular journal.You can access the advanced search options in a few ways: by clicking the downward-pointing arrow at the right edge of the search box when you first pull up the Google Scholar page, or by using the menu to the left of the search results to filter them after you have already begun your research.
For example, if you are interested in what has been written about Vietnamese culture since 2016, you can enter ‘Vietnamese Culture’ in the Google Scholar search box, then click “Since 2016” on the left-hand menu once the service pulls up the search results.

, Google Scholar, like the regular Google Search engine, is designed to be used intuitively, simply by entering the key terms of what you are interested in. However, you can run a more precise search by coupling your search terms with Boolean connectors. For instance:Entering a minus sign (“-”) before a search term will eliminate it from the results. For instance, if you are researching Vietnamese culture but do not want to find results related to the Vietnam War, searching for ‘Vietnamese culture -war’ will stop Google Scholar from giving results that use the key term “war.”
By typing OR (must be capitalized) between search terms, Google Scholar with retrieve results containing either term. If you are interested in the culture of both Vietnam and Thailand, you can search for ‘Vietnam OR Thailand culture’.

, Google Scholar allows users to run more precise searches by entering other text instructions into the search bar. Familiarizing yourself with these can help you find more relevant sources. Some of the most common commands include:Searching for an exact phrase by putting it in quotation marks. Putting the search terms Vietnamese culinary traditions will return all sources containing the words traditions, culinary, and Vietnamese, while searching for “Vietnamese culinary traditions” (in quotation marks) will only return with results with that phrase--those exact words, in that exact order.
Requesting sources with a particular term in the title by using the command “intitle:”. If you want to find works on Vietnamese food traditions with the word “culinary” in the title, search for ‘Vietnamese intitle:culinary’.
Restricting results to those by a particular author by entering “author:” before the name. For example, if you want to find works on Vietnamese culture by M. Thomas, enter ‘Vietnamese culture author:Thomas, M.’

, If you find a source that you find interesting or relevant to your topic, clicking the “Related articles” link at the bottom of a source’s citation information will return results that are connected to that source. For example, the results may include other sources by the same author, ones that use the same keywords, or ones that have similar titles.

, Sometimes, you want to find high-impact sources that are cited by many other sources. Google Scholar will track certain instances when source generate citations in other works. Just look for the link “Cited by” followed by a number (e.g., “Cited by 17”) to see how many of these citations Google Scholar has tracked. Clicking on the link will pull up a separate list of those sources that cite the original source you found.Keep in mind that Google Scholar only tracks citations in works that the service already indexes, and that the “Cited by” number is not the absolute number of citations. This means, for instance, that it will not show if a source is cited in a journal that Google Scholar does not include in its searches.

"
"
Sign up for email alerts.,
Save sources to your Google Scholar library.,
Be aware of Google Scholar’s strengths and weaknesses.",How to Use Google Scholar3," Google Scholar can keep track of any particular search terms you are interested in. When new sources using those terms are added to its database, it will send you an email with citation information for those services. To sign up for these alerts, just click the small envelope icon at the bottom of the left-hand menu on a page of Google Scholar search results, then enter the email address you want to use.For instance, creating an alert for ‘Vietnamese cultural traditions’ will send you an email anytime Google Scholar finds new sources using those key terms.

, If you are logged into your Google account, you can save citation information for interesting sources you find to make it easier to retrieve them later. Just click “Save” at the bottom of a source’s citation information, and Google Scholar will add it to the feature called “My library.”You can access the “My library” feature from the top center of the Google Scholar main page, or from the left-hand menu from a page of search results.

, Google Scholar is free to use and intuitive to operate. It can be useful for running initial searches and for general research. However, you may need to account for some of its limitations when doing research. For example:Many of its search results are restricted.
You cannot limit by the type of source you want to find (e.g., books only, or articles only).
You cannot know which databases Google Scholar uses to find its search results.
There are sometimes errors in the way Google Scholar records data (e.g., journal names may mistakenly be listed as authors)
Some results that Google Scholar retrieves (such as personal web pages, non-peer-reviewed articles, etc.) may not be traditionally-defined scholarship.

Outline your article.,
Make a list of key phrases and keywords for your article.,
Write your article.,
Include hyperlinks in the article.,
Build links to your article.,
Make it easy to share the content


Your content will rank better as a whole if Google can see it being shared on other sites.",How to Write SEO Content,"


Articles should be well written, engaging, and informative. They should present a new angle on a specific topic. A good hook in the beginning along with useful information will make people want to continue reading it. Your article should be useful, entertaining, or otherwise valuable.
A well-written article with good content will attract more traffic, meaning many readers will visit your site. This makes your article more attractive to link marketers (people that link their sites to yours) and increases the likelihood of advertisers wanting to use your page for their advertisements.
Google search engine provides a great weight on the title of articles and blogs. That is why it is crucial that the keyword phrase is present on the title as an important part of an effective SEO content.;
, This is important so that your publisher can include it in the metadata of the page, which is part of the HTML code.


It will be very helpful for the readers and Google ranking if the article is divided with subheadings, as readers appreciate it more when they can read an article with ease. As an important reminder, most people who browse the sites are only skim-reading on the internet. That is why with a subheading they are likely to finish the article and stay on the page for a longer period.
Keywords and key phrases are words or phrases that people would use to search for information on the topic which you are about to write. For example, key phrases for an article on moving could be ""packing and moving"" or ""loading a moving truck,"" while keywords could be ""moving,"" ""relocation,"" or ""relocating.""
Key phrases and keywords are registered by ""spiders,"" which are scripts that search engines send out to every page on the Internet. Spiders ""crawl"" across web pages and websites and analyze them for content and quality of content. One way they do this is by registering the keywords and key phrases to determine the subject of a page; but they also detect how often each keyword or phrases are used, whether a page is grammatically correct, and what types of inbound and outbound hyperlinks there are. Hyperlinks are links to other pages that are somehow relevant to your topic.

,


Make sure it's grammatically correct with no spelling mistakes.
Give your article a title.
Break it up into short paragraphs with subheaders.
Use the most important keywords and key phrases as early in the article as possible, preferably in the first sentence, and in the first paragraph.
Do not overuse keywords or key phrases. Intersperse them naturally throughout the text in the natural reading rhythm of the article. The recommended keyword density is 1-3% .
Include the most important keywords and key phrases in titles and subheaders.
If it makes sense in the text, put keywords and key phrases in bold or italics.
If too many keywords are present on the content, Google search engine will assume that the keywords are stuffing. Do not make a rookie mistake and place those keyword phrases on the 155 - 200 words
If the title includes the keyword phrase, the first sentence of the article should also have the keyword. To break the redundancy, try starting the article through a question. As the keyword is already inserted in the sentence, all you have to do is BOLD it. This will emphasize the keyword and it will make a huge effect on the Google algorithm as it scans the article.
Similar to the first sentence, the keyword should also be present in the last sentence to emphasize the keywords more.

,


Hyperlinks are links to another web page that is relevant to your topic. You can highlight a word or phrase and add the web address to which you want to link. Make sure every link is a quality website that offers sound information and easy navigation.

,


Even if you have written a great article, you must let the world know about it. Simply, share a link to your new article on Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr and encourage friends to re-share it.
Turning keywords into a clickable link allows Google search to emphasize the keywords more and it should be done at the beginning and end of an article where the keywords are mostly located.

, Sharing it yourself like in the ""Build Links to your Article"" step is a great way to start, but making it easy for other people to share can get you even more publicity!

Review the ""Related Searches"" located to the left of your search results for additional keyword suggestions provided to you by Bing. In some cases, you may be able to find and use keyword combinations that are more effective in your search.

, For example, if you want to find websites that contain job offers for freelance journalists, place a specific search phrase in quotation marks such as ""freelance journalist wanted"" or ""freelance journalist needed.""

UPDATE - All but code search appear to have been shut down;
, Most of the following codes are time savers:

""key word phrase"" - using the quotation marks makes google search for the exact phrase. Without the quotation marks, every single word is searched for independently: Every page containing only one of ""key"" or ""word"" or ""phrase"" would be listed, too.







keyword site:domain-name - search for a word on a certain domain. For example you can find every page in Wikipedia, that mentions WikiHow with wikihow site:wikipedia.org.







+key +word - search for pages containing ""key"" AND ""word"".







+key -word - search for pages containing ""key"" BUT NOT ""word"".







+key +(any|of|these) - search for pages containing ""key"" and one of ""any"", ""of"" or ""these"".







vicky.21 - the dot replaces special characters between two terms. Results for this example can be: ""Vicky (21) "", ""Vicky, 21"" oder ""Vicky :: 21"".







, These additional functions are extremely powerful, if you use them in a smart way. This kind of commands is often referred to as ""google hacks"":



intitle:keyword - search the page titles. This doesn't sound too powerful, but it becomes, if you search for the right terms.

intitle:""index of"" mp3 - The apache web server creates an index page, if a directory does not contain a file like index.html or similar. Some people have their mp3-collection in such a folder, which gets the title ""Index of <directory name>"". You can add the name of the particular music piece or the name of the group. The industry and spammers already know, that this trick is being used, so they started to create fake Index-Of pages, which don't contain links to the mp3 files, but links to registration pages. Do not register, give them your email address or pay them. Most often these fake index pages offer illegal services or are there to collect email addresses for spammers.

link:domain name - search for pages, that link a certain domain.

inurl:key word - search result depends on URL contents. Can be used to find pages generated by certain web applications, like

inurl:""ViewerFrame?Mode=refresh"" for web cams.

inanchor:key word - look for texts, that are used in links.

filetype:type of file - search for certain type of files. torrent, iso, ...

cache:www.doesntexistanymore.com - get the version from google's cache.

info:domain name - get a page with more links like cache, related, etc.

* - the asterisk can be used as a wild card. Obama voted * on the * bill will give you stories about different votes on different bills. Note that the * operator works only on whole words, not parts of words.

Open your web browser.,
Type www.google.com into the address bar on top of the page.,

Press enter.,
Browse your options.,
Click on an option that suits you.,
If you don't see anything that fits your needs, refine your search.,
Try these other tips for refining your search.,
Run your search through other parts of Google.",How to Search Google1," Its the icon that says ""Internet"".;
, This will bring you to the Google homepage. You'll see a white screen with a search bar in the center with ""Google"" written above it in colorful writing.

, You could search ""how to find a job"" or ""best restaurant in Oakland,"" for example.

, You can also click on the blue magnifying glass for the same result. This will present you with a list of options that should match your search.

, Scroll down to look through all of the options. If you don't see anything that matches what you want on the first page, you can scroll all the way down and press ""Next"" to be brought to the next list of options.

, If you've found an article that looks like what you want, you can click on it. You'll be brought to a new web page. If you're done reading the article but would like to read more on this topic, you can press the left arrow on the top left-hand screen of your browser to be brought back to the search page.


You can continue to browse your options for as long as you like.

, You can go back to the Google search bar to refine your search. To refine your search, you can make it more specific, focusing on the year or a different detail. For example, instead of searching ""best restaurant in Oakland,"" which may overwhelm you with responses, you can search ""best Chinese food in Oakland 2013,"" which will narrow your search.


You may also need to refine your search if it's too specific. If your search phrase is too long or too specific, you may not find any good matches and will have to go back and try searching something a little more general.

, In addition to refining your search by changing the words you've used, you can also try these search tips:


Common words are usually overlooked during a Google search, so if a common word like ""how"" or ""the"" is essential to your search, put a ""+"" in front of it.
If a set of words belongs together in a phrase, you should put quotes around those words or dashes in between them. This is great for when you know a few lyrics to a song and want to search them to find the song's name. For example:

The-girl-in-the-mirror or ""the girl in the mirror""


You can place a minus sign in front a word that you want to omit from your search results. For example, if you want to search ""nano"" and don't want results for the iPod Nano to show up you can type ""nano - iPod.""
If you're searching for a price range of an item, type the lowest range after a dollar sign and then type ""..."" followed by another dollar sign and the highest price in the range. For example: ""Mattress $250...$400.""

, Instead of searching through the Google search bar when you first pull up Google's home page, you can make your search more specific depending on whether you want to search Google's images, news, or maps. To select one of these options, you can just click on the option on the top left hand side of the Google search bar. Here's what you can do:


Select ""images."" It's the third option from the left on the top of the toolbar. This option will run your search only through images. For example, if you wanted to have images of a celebrity or a fashion style, Google images will be a great resource.
Select ""news."" This option is the fifth option from the right on the top of the toolbar. This is a great option if you just want to search something that's in the news, instead of the term in general.
Once you enter Google news, you can select which country's version of the news you'd like by selecting the arrow under the current edition of the news (""U.S. edition"" if you're in the U.S.) and choosing the country you want. This option appears just under your search bar.
Select ""Maps."" This brings you to Google Maps, where you can find directions from one place to another.

Go to the website: http://www.google.ca/advanced_search

If you're already searching through Google, you can click on the gear on the right hand side of the search page. Select ""Advanced search,"" the second option from the top.

, This requires you to fill out as much as you can of the first half of the new page. You don't have to fill in every box; just focus on the categories you need to improve your search. Here is the information you'll need to provide:


Under ""all of these words"" type in any of the important words in your search.
Under ""exact word or phrase"" type in the word or phrase you're looking for.
Under ""any of these words"" type in any of the words that you want.
Under ""none of these words"" type in any words you don't want.
Under ""numbers ranging from"" type in any numbers in a range you want.
Notice that Google gives you tips for how to perform these same searches while using signs in the actual Google search box. You can find these tips to the right of the search tools.

, Now you can provide even more information about what you're looking for to narrow your results even further. You don't have to select all of the options -- just focus on the ones you need to help narrow your search. Here are your options for further refining your search:


Language. Select the language of your search results.
Region. Find pages published in a particular region.
Last update. Find pages that were updated after a certain date.
Site or domain. If you'd like to narrow down your search for something within a certain website, type in the name of the site.
Terms appearing. Select where you want the terms to have appeared, whether it's in the title of the web page or in the text of the article.
Safe Search. It should be set to ""show most relevant results."" If you'd like to remove any potentially inappropriate articles from your search, select ""filter explicit results.""
Reading level. Modify your search to fit your reading level.
File type. Find pages that are in the format you prefer, whether a PDF or a Word Doc (.doc).
Usage rights. Select one of the options to choose pages you are free to use yourself.

,

, Look through your options to see if you've found an article, or many articles, that fit your needs. If you're still not finding what you're looking for, then you can go back to Google Advanced Search and make your search more or less specific.

It will then search online using the text it found. If the picture doesn’t have any text on it, it will search for similar pictures. The results will be displayed as pictures, and will appear on the bottom of the screen.

Sub-search.,
Get details.",How to Search for Phrases and Expressions in Search Engines," If you are looking for an exact phrase such as ""to be or not be. That is the question"" put the phrase in quotation marks. This will tell the search engine you want to search for this phrase being used verbatim around the web.;
, Think about words & phrases that can uniquely describe what you're searching. Bear in mind that some search engines automatically match multiple/conjugated forms of some words, while others require an exact match, even for singular or plural words. (Example: In 2005, AOL, A9, Google & Netscape by default also looked for some singular nouns or conjugated verbs ""prevent""/ ""preventing"" and matched ""e-mail"" to ""email""; whereas MSN Search & Yahoo required exact matches to words specified as spelled.)

, Enter connected phrases with hyphens or quotes as a single search-item, such as ""baking German-chocolate-cake"" or ""secret-revelation robe"": connecting separate words can pinpoint the search, whereas, putting many separate words would begin matching millions of webpages containing only a few of all the words (especially after more than 3 words/items are specified).

, Use logical connectors or parentheses for more complex searches such as: ""blue-bird OR black-bird OR blackbird"" to match any of several similar items, and find a blackbird as one or two words ""black bird"" etc.

, Be prepared to ""search within resulting webpages"" to further pinpoint information that might be buried hundreds or thousands of pages down the list of matching pages.

, Consult the advanced-search help about whichever search engine is being used. Many search engines treat hyphenated words as equivalent to a phrase in quotation marks: To-be-or-not-to-be.

, You'll find this towards the left hand side of the page below the red ""toolbar"" on the page.This button will give you all your reviews you've already written where you'll be given an option to post a new review as a follow-up to the review you posted before.

,, Compare all your old reviews to your new review you are planning to post? Try to answer some questions: Were all problems dealt with already or are there others that are still open to discussion by the company? In cases where past experience great, how did the present experience stack up - was it any better or worse than before? Did the employees have to encounter any problems? Was there service issues or did things run rather smooth? Although no two reviews should ever be the same, you should get an idea of what is going on before you write a review update., Although most often you'll find this to the right of the businesses name, there will be times (rare) when you'll find this button placed underneath the business name, address and contact details and below the pictures (but above the recommended ""other"" places near the establishment).

You may find that some of your browser settings are reset after performing this scan.

, This is another free program that can find things that AdwCleaner missed. You can download the free version from malwarebytes.org.

After downloading the installer, run it to install Anti-Malware on your computer. You don't need a product key to install the free version for home use.

, You'll likely be prompted to download the latest updates, which is highly recommended. This should only take a few moments., Anti-Malware will begin looking for adware files on your computer. This scan usually takes a little longer than the AdwCleaner scan., This will quarantine any files that Anti-Malware finds during the scan., Sometimes adware will change your browser shortcuts so that they always open a specific website. You can use a free shortcut cleaner tool to scrub your browser shortcuts all at once.

Download the tool from bleepingcomputer.com/download/shortcut-cleaner/.
Run sc-cleaner.exe after downloading it. The program will automatically repair any infected shortcuts, which will only take a moment.
Check the sc-cleaner.txt file on your desktop to see which shortcuts were repaired.

For example, if you need to find a forum in a 'dating niche', then search in Google as 'Dating inurl:forum'. What will happen is; this query will search for dating related sites that has 'forum' in the URL and it will take you directly to the forum page of the particular URL you select from the Google.;
, Note that you may also find other sites in between that would point you to other real forum meetings. Skip it.

, Hence, browse throughout the site. Some of the places where you can find it is 1. Inside the main forum threads as sticky posts, you'll 1st PM that you will get from Forum Admins, at the bottom of the footer, etc.,

, It will be usually at top right or at below the header or somewhere else. Remember, forums have been one of the top backlink building source for SEO masters and Forum boards intentionally keeps the 'Register' button at different places to avoid spam registrations.

, You'll get the mail to the mail address that you have entered while registration. Please remember that at times, the mail will be delayed due to some scenarios like server congestion, manual verification, etc.,

, Even after verifying the mail, you may be put on waiting queue till Admin manually changes your membership status to 'live'. It may take from 5 minutes to indefinite time depending on the admin's availability.

, You know what? Almost all the Forum boards share the same IP Banned list, that is, if your ip address has been banned on one forum board, you'll be automatically banned on other forum boards too. Hence, read the rules well before making your first post.

, After reading the rules, you'll know when and how to make your first post. To control the spamming activity, forum boards has the toughest rules on the internet and even it has two type of moderation- auto moderation and human moderation. Hence, start posting carefully only after analysing all the rules related to the forum, related to the link, related to the thread category you are selecting to post, etc.,

, There are two type of links in forums; i.e., Signature links and Post links. When you enter your links in the Signature field which you'll usually see in the 'user control panel' menu at the top, it is called as signature links. When you post links manually within the posts you write in threads, these are called as 'Post links'. Both has advantages and disadvantages. Signature links is constant and so will be same in all the posts it appear and your job is easier to post links. But you may never be able to be found in a forum board if you have an access to signatures. Hence, first check 'user cpanel' and find the 'signature' tab. If you don't find it, search threads using the search bar available on forum board with the keyword 'signature'. Now read all the postings to know where and how to use signature if it's available. Also understand that some signatures allow either html tags or bb codes or nothing. These vary at every forum boards mostly. The other link type is the post links- any link that you add within a post is post link. Most of the forum has formatting options and so you can select the keyword you want to post link on and select the 'URL' option at top and enter the url you want to link to, you can also have a naked urls within the post, but these are all again depends on the forum sites you are posting at.

Make your content relevant to the searcher.,
Make your content reader friendly.,
Ensure your content is easy to find.,
Take it easy on the pop-ups.,
Make your website design responsive.,
Speed up your website.,
Use colors and images wisely.",How to Fix Pogo Sticking in SEO," No one wants to search for something, click on a promising result, and then see that the webpage's content is irrelevant to the original search. This is why it’s important that your webpage's content (text, photos, videos, etc.) is relevant to your webpage's title and metadata.


Summarize what a searcher will find with the page title.
Introduce the page topic right away with no ""fluff"" or filler. This allows for quick engagement and it doesn’t waste the searcher's time.
Take inspiration from others who are ranking well and are receiving a lot of quality clicks if you are having trouble creating content for a page or a blog post.;
, Nobody wants to sift through paragraphs to find what they want.


Format your content with the reader's time in mind.
Use subheadings, bulleted lists, and numbered steps with clear titles to allow the reader to easily jump to page sections that matter the most to them.

, A broken link can stop a Google crawler from indexing your website, which can result in poor performance on search engines. This also affects user experience, because no one likes clicking on a page that can't be found.


Know your sitemap. This is a directory of every page on your website. Search engines use your sitemap to crawl and index your website.
Use Google’s Search Console tool to find any broken links on your site and meet with your web developer to fix any problems.
Use social media and email to share direct links to your awesome content so your audience has easy access.

, While pop-ups can work, they should be used with caution. Some visitors can be turned off by them, as it feels like a business is forcing its products on you.


Put a cookie on your website to track who is a returning visitor and target the pop-ups for those who are new to your site.
Use simple design and compelling call to action, while not asking for too much information so that you don’t seem to be imposing on a visitor's privacy.

, Considering the popularity of mobile browsing, this is extremely important. A “responsive” website is a website that offers easy reading, navigation, and an optimal viewing experience with minimal resizing, panning, and scrolling.


Check to see if your website is mobile-friendly by using Google’s Mobile Friendly Test Tool. If your site is not mobile-friendly, get in touch with your webmaster.

, 47 percent of consumers expect a web page to load in two seconds or less, and 40 percent of people abandon a website that takes more than three seconds to load.


Make page sizes smaller by decreasing the amount of pictures and videos, as well as text. Spread this out over multiple pages and include links.

, There is a right and a wrong way to use color and images when it comes to website design. A poor design can negatively affect your user’s experience.


Read up on the psychology of color.
Make sure that you are not utilizing too many colors on your website. A good rule of thumb is to use only around three or four colors within your color scheme.
Use only images that represent your business’s image accurately. This allows searchers to have a quick idea of what you’re all about.

Look at the person who wrote the reviews profile.,
Read their reviews.",How to Spot Fake Yelp Reviews," Profile pictures say a lot! If the person who posted a bad review does not have a profile picture at all, that is a great first reason to be suspicious of the review.;
, If you see that the person has no friends, or very few friends, in combination with 1 or 2 reviews, odds are it is a slander review by a competitor.


Typically, people will not go out of their way to make a username and go all the way through the sign up process to post one bad review. That is, unless, they have something to gain, like taking business away from a competitor.

, Odds are if it is a fake profile, they will list little to no information, and leave spots like interests and hobbies empty. Again, they have no reason to fill out a profile; they are simply trying to make competitors lose business.

, This is very important. If you see that it is something vague like ‘Terrible service, will not go back!’, it is usually a fake.


When people post reviews, they tend to describe their experience in detail. They will use names, pricing, and things that happened when they used the company.
These four steps are the easiest way to tell if the review you are reading is real or not. If the review you are reading has 2 or more of these things wrong, then it is probably a slanderous review in an attempt to make their company look better.

Become familiar with the use of keywords in online marketing.,
Take out Pay-Per-Click ads.,
Start an analytics program on your website.,
Go to Google's search engine.,
Look for the suggestions that pop up below the search bar.,
Go to WordStream's free keyword tool, at wordstream.com/keywords.,
Review your analytics account.,
Use Wikipedia to find long tail keywords.,
Add your region, city name or store location to the search terms.,
Use Google Trends, google.com/trends, to find keywords that are trending right now.,
Make a list of 5 to 10 of the best long tail keywords from your research.

,
Set up analytics campaigns to track the use of new keywords on your website, in email marketing and in PPC ads.,
Consider placing your long tail keywords in the following places.",How to Find Long Tail Keywords,"


Search for your product online. Guess what words people are using to search for your goods. If you have not yet optimized your web page with keywords, your website may not come up in search results as you had expected.
Use search engines to find your competitors. Note which keywords rank their website highly in the results. Do dozens of searches to find which keywords are working for your competitors, and which important keywords they may be ignoring.;
, This is the best way to become familiar with keywords and how valuable they are in the online advertising marketing.


Try PPC ads on Google Adwords and Microsoft AdCenter to begin with. Choose several keywords, including multiple terms at once, to see which are the most successful. You will only pay when someone clicks on your ad. You can also set limits for how many clicks you can afford per day.
Review the reports of the PPC ad success on AdWords and AdCenter sites. See how much traffic they drive to your website. Also, look at how quickly your limits were reached and which keywords provided the best conversion rates.
In PPC advertising, head keywords, those that are the most broad and common, are more expensive. You will be asked to bid on the amount you will pay per click. The amount you decide will be weighted depending upon how your competition bids. For small businesses, head keyword ads are often too expensive, so long tail keywords offer the best targeting and value.

, If you do not have a built in program that tracks your web traffic, install Google Analytics to monitor how people are finding your website.

, Type in several head keywords.

, These are queries that people have typed into Google.


For example, you may type in ""workout clothes."" Google search may suggest ""workout clothes for women."" This second group of words is called a long tail keyword.

, Type in long tail keywords, such as ""workout clothes for women"" to see how well they perform.


You will learn the frequency with which these long tail phrases are used for searching. You may be surprised to note that the most common related long tail keywords are ""2xx womens workout clothes"" and ""workout clothes women.""
Repeat the process with other potential long tail keywords that relate to your products, services or content. Write down the 2 to 3 most searched phrases for each potential keyword.

, In the web traffic section of your analytics program there should be a section that shows traffic sources and search terms. Ask your marketing department or web programmer if you cannot find it.


If you are using Google Analytics, you can find these terms in the ""Traffic Sources"" section under ""Sources."" Look in ""Search"" and choose ""Organic.""

, This is primarily useful with content, not products.


Type in your search term. Go to an article. Look in the Table of Contents and see what topics are subheadings in the article.

, Adding a phrase like ""Los Angeles"" or ""Culver City"" to ""Workout pants"" may make it a highly specialized and valuable long tail keyword.


Test your regional long tail keyword in WordStream's keyword tool. Certain areas will have higher results than others.

, These may be keywords that you only want to use on your website or PPC ads for a month; however, they can improve your search results immediately.


Type in your search terms. You will see a graph to show if the prevalence of the keywords is changing for better or worse. Experiment with news-related items until you find several search terms that are hot now.

,, AdCenter and AdWords help track this information for you.

,


Replace the head keywords in PPC ads with long tail keywords. Test them for at least 2 weeks before analyzing the results. Pay special attention to the conversion rate in sales. Long tail keywords may produce fewer clicks; however, they are targeted. When you find the right keywords, they should result in more sales per click, making them more valuable because you pay per click.
Use them in your article titles, URLs, image names, meta descriptions, meta tags and content. If you do not have a marketing employee in charge of SEO, you may want to employ a consultant at this time. Take your most successful long tail keywords and add them to these areas. Monitor your increase in web traffic from organic sources.
Create backlinks with social media and edu websites that use these keywords. Write status updates and post link content that uses the keywords on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and blogs.
Post high quality content that includes these long tail keywords. Hire a professional writer who can include them without sacrificing the quality of the content. Encourage user reviews on those website pages, which will encourage others to use combinations of those keywords in their comments.

Experiment with different search engines.,
Begin with simple search queries.,
Search with quotation marks.,
Try alternative words.,
Bookmark useful results.",How to Find Information Online1," For the most part, everybody knows Google, but there are several other great search engines to work with. These include Bing, Yahoo, Lycos, and Ask.com. Rather than always relying on Google, experiment with a variety of search engines. Each one may return different results.;
, When you use search engines, it is best to limit your query to a few concise words. Try to think of the simplest way to describe what you're looking for. You don't need to use complete sentences, rather simply type a few important terms.


For example, if you were trying to find information on the actor John Wayne, but you couldn't recall his name, you might try searching ""cowboy actor.""

, Anytime you are looking for a specific phrase, type the phrase inside the quotes (""the phrase"") and search it. The quotation marks tell your search engine to look for any place those specific words appear. This will help streamline your search, and weed out things that are not relevant to you.

, Whenever you search for something, try searching a few different ways. Use synonyms and/or put your query in a different form. This will cause your search engine to return different results, helping you locate what you need.

, Whenever you conduct research online, it is easy to move quickly and lose track of places you’ve visited. Use the bookmark function on your web browser to record useful websites as you go.

"
"
Google them.,
Refine your search.,
Use deeper search tools.",How to Find a Current Address for Someone1," Of all the ways you can find somebody, Google is probably the easiest. But searching for them requires a little more effort than searching just for their name.


For example, we'll use Dave Wilson, who was the drummer for the Cascades back in the 60s. In the Google Search field, we'll enter just ""Dave Wilson,"" with quotes. Using quotes forces the search to use both words in order, so we don't get results that include ""Dave Whickershnaker loves to play volleyball but only uses the Wilson brand.""
As we can see right away, there's going to have to be some narrowing of the choices. Google returned almost 900,000 results!;
, We'll do this by adding a key association that is unique to Dave Wilson — his band, the Cascades. This time we find what we're looking for.


We now know what happened to Dave Wilson — he passed away in 2000.

, Sometimes the easy way turns up nothing. The person you are looking for may have changed their name, may have gone ""off the grid,"" or may have passed away before leaving their mark. When that happens, there are alternatives.


Google ""people search,"" and you will be presented with a list of sites that will help you find who you are looking for, many of them advertising free searches.
Be aware that ""free"" often means they will get you part of the way there—and then you pay for the actual contact information.

Search academic databases.,
Look into specialized online libraries.,
Look for videos.,
Utilize review sites and price-comparison sites.,
Check out RSS feeds.",How to Find Information Online2," If you are looking for peer-reviewed academic articles, the best place to start is an academic database. If you attend (or work for) a university, you can probably access exclusive databases through your library’s online catalog. If this is not the case for you, try Jstor, ARTstor, Ebsco, or Google Scholar. Be aware, however, that not every article you find will be available for free., The internet contains specialized online libraries for many, many different subjects. Seeking these collections can help to speed up your search, as well as provide reliable places to return to for all sorts of information.For information on the Arts, check out the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), Art Cyclopedia, or UBUWeb.
For information on history, try the Perseus Digital Library, Project Gutenberg, or Digital History.
For medical and scientific articles, visit BioMed Central.

, When individuals search for information online, they tend to think in terms of text, but many useful educational videos exist online as well! In fact, sometimes a video is the best way to learn what you seek. Many informative user-generated videos exists on Youtube.
For more reputable information provided by professionals, search for videos on TED (otherwise known as TED talks).

, If you are looking on the internet for something to buy, you can use review sites and/or price-comparison sites to locate the best version of what you need for a competitive price.Review sites like Amazon, Reevoo, and Trustpilot can help you decide if a particular product is worthwhile.
Price-comparison sites like Money Supermarket and Comparethemarket.com can help you find the best price.

, Many websites operate newsfeeds (otherwise known as RSS feeds). You can use an RSS reader to compile information from various RSS feeds. This allows you to see when new information appears on your favorite sites, without having to visit them one at a time.Some good RSS readers include Feedly, Newsblur, and Flipboard (tablet only).

For instance, what subject field does this information fit into? (Is it art, science, how-to, etc?) Then (now that you are aware of some different types of online resources) consider where information like this could be found., Identify three or more key terms that are central to your search before you begin. These terms are going to guide your search. Searching for these terms through search engines, databases, or online libraries will lead in the direction of the information you need., Whenever you find information online, read through it and figure it out whether it is a primary source, or if it is referencing something else.

, Whenever you conduct research (online or otherwise) it is essential for you to take notes. Keep a log of the websites you visit.

Facebook is clever enough to highlight people in your location, and whether or not you friends in common. But we know John Smith doesn't live here, so we need to expand our search a bit. Either click on the magnifying glass on the right of the search field, or at the bottom of the menu, select ""See more results for John Smith."" This takes you to a more comprehensive search page.

Clicking on the Pages filter, we find the John Smith we're looking for — it appears he has a band and lives in England.

, On occasion, the person you are searching for will be unlisted. In this case, you can go to a public records information site, and pay for the information you want. A good example is Intelius.Professional sites will usually offer one-time fees for either simple contact information or a background report—ideal if you are searching for history on a potential employee or business associate.
The price and quality of people search services can vary greatly. U.S. Search and Intellius are the top rated services, but as with any online services, your experience may vary depending on what and who you are looking for. Check the tips for ways to narrow down the choices.

Contact a mutual friend.,
Trace them down yourself.,
Hire a Private Investigator.",How to Find a Current Address for Someone3," Alright, so maybe your target is one of those folks that is heavily anti-social networking and prides himself on having a non-existent Google results number. What do you do then?


Rack your brain. Who do you know that might have a lead? Did you both hang out with Edwin your sophomore year of college every Wednesday for pints and pizza? Maybe he knows where John is! You might have to hit up an old friend you haven't spoken to in years, but the effort could pay off.

, So you can't seem to think of any mutual friends that know the whereabouts of your mystery person. Now you may have to do the dirty work. This works best if your target has stayed reasonably local.


Think of the last place you knew they lived, worked, and frequented. If the government can track and find people, you might as well give it a shot! See if you can stumble across someone who knew them by recreating their steps. They may be able to point you in the right direction.

, Alright, so this one may be a tad much, but if you have money to burn, why not? A PI can do all the dirty work for you while you sit back and enjoy not sifting through Google result after Google result.

If not, you may have do some digging to find it from within the website (such as via a review or other posting or a posting on their Talk boards, etc.).

A browser is a program you use to surf the Internet. Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome are some of the most popular browsers.;
, Once Bing is up, you will see a search box in the middle of the page and a menu bar on top of the site. The menu bar consists of options like Web, Images, Videos, News, MSN, and more. Click on “Images” so you can search for images.

, Remember the search box mentioned in Step 2? Its function is to take your keywords and process them. Go to the search box, and write the keyword for the kind of image/picture you are looking for, and then hit the Enter key.


A keyword can be any word like “mountains,” “education,” or even the name of a person such as “Angelina Jolie.”

, Once you see the different images related to your keyword displayed on your screen as search results, take your mouse and hover over an image. You will then see a button at the bottom of that image that says “Image Match.” Click on that button.


Image Match is the feature helps to match images searched for to the right resolution and size.

, When you click on the “Image Match” button, Bing returns a list of images with different sizes. This, therefore, narrows your search by the size of the image, and makes it easier for you to get specific results for images that suit your need.


Click on “View all sizes” to expand the list of images.

, Bing, through the Image Match feature, can also help you look for images by reverse image searching, which is when you don’t type a keyword into the search engine, but instead you use an actual image to see whether the same or related images exist online. You either upload an image from your computer to Image Match or key in the image URL.


Click the “Image Match” button, and you will see the blue “Upload an image” option. Select that option, and browse for the image on your computer.
Below the “Upload an image” option is a box similar to the search box. That box is where you type or paste the URL of an image that you want to find more of online.
To get an image’s URL, right-click on an online photo to bring up a menu. Choose “Copy image URL.” Get back to Bing, and right-click on the box below “Upload an image,” and click on “Paste.”

Find the right image: Always give first priority to adding your own original and unique images.,
Prepare images for use in your article: On finding the right image for your content be it a chart, an illustration or simply a photo, the next step is to optimizing that image as per the associated keyword or content on your website.,
Choose the right file name: Image SEO begins with choosing the right file name for the Image.,
Scale for image SEO: Image loading time is a crucial factor when User Experience is concerned and thus, important for SEO.,
Reduce file size: The next step in image optimization is to make sure that scaled image is displayed in the smallest possible file size.,
Add captions: The caption is the text that accompanies the image on the webpage.,
Provide alt text and title text: The alt text is the descriptive text for an image that is displayed when the image for some reasons could not be displayed to the visitor.,
Add XML image sitemaps: If you are a website developer, you might be unsure about XML image sitemaps.",How to Do Image Optimization for SEO," Your article should have an image that has the same subject as your article. It is wrong on all levels if you choose to use any image just for the sole purpose of adding an image. The image should portray the topic of the post or webpage, or have some illustrative importance within the article The reason behind is that an image surrounded by interrelated text, ranks higher for the keyword associated with it for optimization.;
, This involves several things to be taken into consideration, This is the first place where you can use the keyword for which you want that particular content or page to rank. Google cannot read images. Google can only read text and so incase of images it reads the text related to it starting from the name of your image file. For example, if your image is a cat with background of Eiffel tower, the file name should not be IMG-00012345.jpg, but cat-at-eiffel-tower.jpg. The main keyword would be “cat at Eiffel Tower”, as it is the main subject of the photo and that is why it should be added at the beginning of the file name.

, The faster it takes for a site to load, the easier it is to visit and thus indexing of the particular page is better. Images have a huge impact on loading times of a webpage, Even if you add a huge image and display it really small on the webpage, like using a 1500×500 pixels image and showing it at 150×50 pixels size. The entire weight of the image will still have to be loaded. Thus, images should be scaled to the size you want to show it. WordPress provides the image in multiple sizes after uploading it. Unfortunately that doesn’t optimize the file size as well, that’s just the display size of the image. Image can be scaled using simple tools like Microsoft paint, Photoscape, etc., You can reduce the file size of images by several methods like by removing the EXIF data., For most images it is the text in the gray section below it or displayed in a separate div below the but on the image. People use those captions in scanning an article. Right after the headings, people tend to go through the image and take account of the caption as well in their viewing. Captions are not necessarily be added to all images. Sometimes images serve another purpose other than foe SEO optimization. It is important to decide if the image in question is an image you would want to use for SEO or not. Keeping aside image optimization for SEO you should add a caption to make senses to the visitor. You should think about the visitor first and then image optimization., In situations where the image is not displayed to the reader, maybe because they have turned off images in their browser or are due to some visual impairment are using some screen reader, the alternative text ensures helps in preserving the information or functionality of the webpage. Make sure you add alt texts that include your SEO keyword and also relate to or describe the image. The alt tag and title tag is to be added to the tag in the HTML source code of the website, Google says Adding images to your XML sitemaps help Google index your images. So it is a best practice to add them to sitemap for better image SEO optimization."

, Finding out which keywords are the most profitable and popular for your site will be useful for SEO and paid search advertising.


Conduct searches using what you consider to be your most popular keywords. Judge the relevance based on your competition. If that search pulls up competitors and products that offer what you offer, then you may try to get a larger share of that market. If the search terms don't bring up similar products, change your terms to try to find more specific words that will be more profitable.
Do some paid advertising for research. Set up Pay-Per-Click campaigns using your top keywords on Google AdWords and/or Microsoft adCenter. Determine the number of sales you achieve for your ad to get a percentage.
Analyze the profitability of your keywords by establishing the profit you get from the clicks you receive. Determine how many dollars you reap per 100 visitors. For example, if you receive 1000 clicks from a PPC campaign and you make a profit of $4000, then each click is worth $4.

, Each site should have at least 1 static text link. In order for a link to be popular and achieve high search engine ranking, it should be easy to find, remember and access.

, While Ajax, Adobe Flash Player or JavaScript might improve the look of your website, the information in your site will be encrypted so that search engine crawlers cannot see it. Choose straight forward web design whenever possible.

, Each page of important content should contain at least 1 of your profitable keywords. Simplify your URLs before you post content to your site.

, Articles, videos, tutorials and other content should contain your profitable keywords in the URL, headline, first sentence and first paragraphs. This concentration will create a higher ranking on search engines.

, Creating an attractive page for your content that addresses your customer's needs will increase your conversion rate. Landing pages can be set up to track important search engine data, so that you can evaluate them next to your general website homepage.

, Most search engines recommend that you invest in high-quality, customer oriented content. The more you encourage people to return to your website, the more popular the link is and the ranking will be higher on search engines.

, These are the attributes that are often hidden from view, but they describe your website content to the search engines. Each piece of media should contain your lucrative keywords and be both descriptive and simple.

Set up an infrastructure to set and track paid search advertising campaigns.,
Experiment with each type of paid search advertisement.,
Check your campaign twice or more per week.,
Refine your paid search engine advertisements.,
Develop a procedure for advertising new or important content on search engines.",How to Do Search Engine Marketing2," It is difficult to set up a successful advertising campaign, if you don't already have a system for setting up Internet advertising campaigns. The following are things to ensure you have set up before paying for search engine advertisements:


Choose a goal for your search engine advertising. Paid advertisements require that you choose keywords, so promoting specific content or products in a campaign is often more successful than trying to promote your business in general. Choose a single campaign to set up when you are just starting paid searches.
Establish your budget. Consider labor, pay-per-click bids, tracking and the duration of the budget.
Establish your baseline of search engine traffic. Spend 1 to 3 months tracking your search engine statistics without paid advertisements. Create a report, so that you can compare each campaign against your baseline traffic.
Invest in tracking software. If your website infrastructure does not already include high-tech tracking software, you will not be able to determine if you have a successful campaign. Investing in installing tracking pages that tell you where your traffic comes from will allow you to save money on redundant marketing campaigns.
Choose key performance indicators (KPI). These are factors that you use to judge the performance of an advertising campaign. They should be numbers, comments or sales that you can track through the course of the campaign.

, Try 1 of each type and track what is most successful for your website. The following are the most commonly used ways of paying for search engine advertising:


Try paid placement listings. These sponsored listings may or may not be Pay-Per-Click. They are usually highlighted at the top, bottom or side of the search results. AOL, Google, Bing, Ask and many other search engines offer sponsored listings.
Try a paid submission with Yahoo. You will need to develop a keyword-rich description of your website and pay to have it listed with Yahoo's directory.
Try banner ads on search engines. Banner ads are used all over the Internet, but they can also appear on the top, bottom and sides of a search results screen when people search for your keywords. It should be a well designed graphic that has proven results with attracting people to your page.
Try content promotion. If you are looking to advertise a specific piece of high-quality content, you can pay to have it listed as sponsored content. AOL, Ask and Yahoo use sponsored content schemes.

, You should assign someone to track the progress of your campaign and to develop data with it. Do not let a campaign go for more than a month before evaluating whether it is giving you results.

, Remove any campaigns that have not been successful and evaluate them for future reference. Stick with types of advertisements that show profitable results.

, Many of your classic keywords and brand name focused paid advertisements will stay up for a long period of time; however, you should also develop a system for promotion via search engines. Make it part of your marketing plan.

Identify the main topic of your paper.,
Summarize your theme.,
Think about the key points that you cover in your paper.,
Identify the most important points of your paper.,
Keep in mind that keywords don’t have to include prepositions or articles.",How to Determine Keywords for Your Paper1," Most of your keywords should focus on the main topic of your paper. Because you wrote the paper, you will know what words best describe your topic. Think about your thesis and your overall theme. What’s the main focus?


Are you writing about the behavioral issues that cats exhibit? Are you writing about Lincoln’s contribution to the Civil War?;
, Try to focus on the theme of your paper and sum it up in one to three words. These are the words that most accurately relate to the theme of your paper. For example:


Maybe your keywords could be “cat behavioral problems” for a paper on behavioral issues that cat’s exhibit.
Your keywords could be “Lincoln’s war influence” if your article is about Lincoln’s contribution to the Civil War.

, Consider the key points that you try to convey in your paper. What are the sub topics you discuss in order to prove your thesis?


For a paper about cat behavioral issues, you may talk about how cats interact with kittens, aggressive behaviors, loving behaviors, and behaviors that represent depression.

, Distill these main points down into one, two, or three word groupings that effectively summarize the points that you made to prove your thesis. For the example of the cat article you may write something like:


”Cat interactions kittens” or “aggression cats”.

, When writing your keywords, you do not need to create full sentences. In fact, you should leave out things like prepositions and articles because search engines tend to filter out these words anyway.


Prepositions describe the relationship between two words in a sentence. They include words like “in”, “between”, “before”, etc.There are only two articles, “a” and “the”."
"
Think like a reader when creating your keywords.,
Ask friends to read over your paper.,
Provide synonyms if possible.,
Focus your keywords.,
Think about using a keyword density analyzer.",How to Determine Keywords for Your Paper2," That is to say, what sort of words would you use to run a search on the topic of your paper? One way to do this is to go to your search engine of choice and type in search terms for your topic without really thinking about it.


See what you put in, and compare it to your paper. Are they words you are using throughout your paper? If so, consider using those words for your keywords.

, They can help you identify main ideas and key points. Sometimes, when you are so involved in a topic, it can be challenging to break the topic down to its most concise points.

, If you have ample space for keywords, provide words and sets of words that have the same meaning but use different words. This will help to draw more readers to your article because your keywords will cover a larger amount of searches.

, If your keywords are for research purposes, you can use larger vocabulary and discipline-specific jargon. However, if the purpose of your keywords are to get hits on websites, then you need to think shorter and snappier.


What kinds of things from your paper are more likely to get hits? For example, “cats” are very popular on the internet, so using “cats” instead of “felines” makes more sense; however, if you are using keywords in a scientific database, “felines” may make more sense.

, You can find keyword density analyzers online. Once you have pulled one up, enter your text into the text box and let the analyzer assess your paper.


The analyzer will generate one-, two-, and three-word phrases. Choose the ones that best fit your overall theme. One bonus to this approach is that you know you are using words that are actually from your paper.

Publish original content on your website.,
Use titles that accurately describe the news topics.,
Publish articles of a considerable length.,
Enlist multiple authors to generate content for your website.,
Generate multiple news articles on a daily basis.,
Display videos or images on your website relevant to news content.,
Display advertisements on your news site.,
Feature an ""About"" or ""Contact"" page on your website.,
Choose a professional template or layout for your website.,
Work with your webmaster on enforcing specific technical requirements for Google News.,
Submit your website to the Google News team for review.",How to Add Your Site to Google News," Google will not add your site to Google News if your content has been copied from or resembles the content from another source.;
, Titles should contain between 2 and 22 words and consist of major keywords about the subject.


Place titles in bold lettering directly above your articles in a news-style format.
Try to use titles that are unique compared to other news sites. Google News may filter out your articles if the titles match those of other articles that have already been published by other news sites. For example, if your news article is about celebrities who get married, try a unique title such as ""Celebrity A: 3rd Marriage a Charm to Celebrity B"" instead of ""Celebrity A Marries Celebrity B.""

, Google News will seek content with a sufficient word-length of at least 250 words that can provide value to news readers.

, Google News will consider sites from established organizations, or companies, in which a variety of authors contribute news content.


Create a page on your website that displays short biographies and photos of each writer to establish their presence on your site.
Add bylines to each article that displays the author's name and the date the article was written.

, Google News will look for heavily active websites that can provide fresh content on a regular basis.


Publish at least 3 news articles per day to keep your content fresh, and publish at least 100 articles before you submit your site to Google News for review. This will demonstrate that your website is dedicated to generating updated news stories.

, This may help your website appear more attractive to and grab the attention of readers.

, Advertisements will help prove that your website generates a regular amount of traffic or produces a lucrative amount of business.


Refrain from posting a large number of advertisements on your website. A large number of ads may cause your site to appear malicious to the Google News team upon review.

, This will help establish the validity of your organization to both Google News and the readers who will visit your website through Google News.


Provide contact information for your company or organization, such as phone numbers, mailing addresses, and email addresses for each writer or editor.

, Google News will consider websites that resemble professional news sites as opposed to blog layouts.


Select a layout that aligns most closely with the type of news you feature. For example, if you are a news site that specializes in sports, you may want to choose a layout background of a sports arena, or display sidebar information about game scores or the dates of sporting events.

,


Establish unique URLs for each article to allow for proper indexing by Google News. Google News will only recognize URLs that contain at least 3 digits and do not resemble years. For example, Google News will index URLs with ""995"" in the title, but not ""2010"" because it resembles a year.
Ensure that the platform hosting your website can incorporate keywords of your article into the body of the URL. This will help Google News rank your articles more efficiently. For example, have your Content Management System (CMS) modified if your article URLs are published strictly with numbers instead of keywords.

Visit the Google website featured in the Sources section of this article and click on the ""send us"" link to access the Google News submission form.

Understand robots.txt files.,
Create and save and robots.txt file.,
Write a full-disallow robots.txt file.,
Write a conditional-allow robots.txt file.,
Encourage bots to index and crawl your site.,
Save the txt file to the root of your domain.",How to Block Search Engines1," A robots.txt file is a plain or ASCII text file that informs search engine spiders what they are allowed to access on your site. Files and folders listed in a robots.txt file may not be crawled and indexed by a search engine spiders. You may need a robots.txt file if:


You want to block specific content from search engine spiders.
You are developing a live site and are not prepared to have search engine spiders crawl and index the site
You want to limit access to reputable bots.;
, To create the file, launch a plain text editor or a code editor. Save the file as: robots.txt. The file name must be all lowercase.Do not forget the “s.”
When you save the file, choose the extension “‘.txt”’. If you are using Word, select the “Plain Text” option.

, It is possible to block every reputable search engine spider from crawling and indexing your site with a “full-disallow” robots.txt. Write the following lines in your text file:







User-agent: *
Disallow: /





Using a “full-disallow” robots.txt file is not strongly recommended. When a bot, such as Bingbot, reads this file, it will not index your site and the search engine will not display your website.

User-agents: this is another term for search engine spiders, or robots

*: the asterisk signifies that the code applies to all user-agents

Disallow: /: the forward slash indicates that the entire site is off-limits to bots, Instead of blocking all bots, consider blocking specific spiders from certain areas of your site.Common conditional-allow commands include:


Block a specific bot: replace the asterisks next to User-agent with googlebot, googlebot-news, googlebot-image, bingbot, or teoma.Block a directory and its contents:




User-agent: *
Disallow: /sample-directory/





Block a webpage:




User-agent: *
Disallow: /private_file.html





Block an image:




User-agent: googlebot-image
Disallow: /images_mypicture.jpg





Block all images:




User-agent: googlebot-image
Disallow: /





Block a specific file format:




User-agent: *
Disallow: /p*.gif$






, Many people want to welcome, instead of block, search engine spiders because they want their entire site indexed. To accomplish this, you have three options. First, you can opt out of creating a robots.txt file—when the robot does not find a robots.txt file, it will continue to crawl and index your entire site. Second, you can create an empty robots.txt file—the robot will find the robots.txt file, recognize that it is empty, and continue to crawl and index your site. Lastly, you can write a full-allow robots.txt file.Use the code:







User-agent: *
Disallow:





When a bot, such as googlebot, reads this file, it will feel free to visit your entire site.

User-agents: this is another term for search engine spiders, or robots

*: the asterisk signifies that the code applies to all user-agents

Disallow: the blank disallow command indicates that all files and folders are accessible

, After you have written the robots.txt file, save the changes. Upload the file to your site’s root directory. For example, if your domain is www.yourdomain.com, place the robots.txt file at www.yourdomain.com/robots.txt.

Understand HTML robots meta tags.,
Block bots from a single page.,
Allow the bots to index a page, but not follow its links.,
Let the search engine spiders follow the links but not index the page.,
Block a single outgoing link.,
Block a specific search engine spider.,
Encourage bots to crawl and index your page.",How to Block Search Engines2," The robots meta tag allows programmers to set parameters for bots, or search engine spiders. These tags are used to block bots from indexing and crawling an entire site or just parts of the site. You can also use these tags to block a specific search engine spider from indexing your content. These tags appear in the head of your HTML file.This method is commonly used by programmers that do not have access to a website’s root directory.

, It is possible to block all bots from indexing a page and or from following a page’s links. This tag is commonly used when a live site is under development. Once the site is complete, it is strongly recommended that you remove this tag. If you do not remove the tag, your page will not be indexed or searchable via search engines.You may block bots from indexing the page and from following any of the links:




<meta name=”robots” content=“noindex, nofollow”>





You may block all bots from indexing the page:




<meta name=”robots” content=“noindex”>





You may block all bots from following the page’s links:




<meta name=”robots” content=“nofollow”>






, If you allow the bots to index the page, the page will be indexed; if you prevent the spiders from following the links, the link path from this specific page to other pages will break.Insert the following line of code into your header:






<meta name=”robots” content=“index, nofollow”>





, If you allow the bots to follow the links the link path from this specific page to other pages will remain in tact; if you restrict them from indexing the page, your web page will not appear in the index.Insert the following line of code into your header:






<meta name=”robots” content=“noindex, follow”>





, To hide a single link on a page, embed a rel tag within the <a href> </a> link tag. You may wish to use this tag to block links on other pages that lead to the specific page you want to block.<a href=""yourdomain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Insert Link to Blocked Page</a>





, Instead of blocking all bots from your web page, you may wish to prevent one bot from crawling and indexing the page. To accomplish this, replace “‘robot”’ within the meta tag with the name of a specific bot.Examples include: googlebot, googlebot-news, googlebot-image, bingbot, and teoma.<meta name=”bingbot” content=“noindex, nofollow”>





, If you want to ensure that your page will be indexed and its links will be followed, you can insert a follow-allow meta “robot” tag into your header.Use the following code:






<meta name=”robots” content=“index, follow”>

, It’s important to answer each one as the more information you give about yourself, the more credible you will look to others.


The rationale behind this is, those who make fake profiles make a great number of them, and answering the questions becomes too tedious a step.

, You will see an “Edit Picture” button right about your name. Click on it and browse your computer for a good photo of you to upload to your profile.


Again, most fake profiles won’t bother putting in a photo. Without one, your profile looks bogus.

, They’re right next to the questions, and will range from your nickname to your hobbies, from your first concert to your last meal.


These questions are put in place so that people reading your reviews know that you’re for real, and your reviews are the real deal as well.

, Don’t let your account go to waste by not posting new reviews for months on end. Just that one review on your profile makes it look suspect, as if it was created to serve just one company. That’s a red flag right there!

Elite Yelpers must be of legal drinking age in their city.
Elite members cannot be affiliated with any local businesses, in order to promote fair reviews.;
, The most important step to becoming an Elite Yelper is to write as many useful and unbiased reviews as possible. Make sure that your reviews are comprehensive but easy to read, and that they don’t contain very many glaring errors.


Upload pictures of your food or of the service you are reviewing.
Add tips to existing posts to help broaden the amount of information available
Don’t play favorites with certain establishments. Try to write fairly about every place you go to.

, The more you contribute the more valuable you will appear to the Community Managers. Try to write a review for every place you visit. Elite Yelpers are considered diplomats to their city’s culture, so stay on top of what’s hot and write reviews on it.

, Avoid writing like a robot. Yelp Community Managers look for members who are engaging and relatable, so spice up your reviews by writing in a conversational tone and allow your inner wittiness to shine through.

, Vote on reviews, leave comments and interact with the community as much as possible. Keep your comments civil and well thought out. Compliment other users on particularly good reviews.


Take some time each week to welcome new members to Yelp. Community Managers look highly upon people who work to foster the Yelp community.

, The Community Managers are not the ones in charge of determining who will be Elite for the year, but they have input and influence. Comment on their reviews and chat them up so that your name stands out when it comes time to make the decisions.

, Other Yelp members can nominate you, or you can nominate yourself by following the link on the Elite page.


Enter your city. If your city or town is not listed, you can still become a National Elite member.
Enter your name. Yelp needs to know your real name before you can apply to be an Elite Yelp member.
Enter your Yelp profile URL. This will allow the Community managers to quickly see your profile and check your reviews and contributions.
Tell Yelp why you deserve to be Elite. In the box labeled “Tell us why”, write a few sentences about why you should be considered for Elite status. Get creative and fun to help set yourself apart from all of the other entries."

, This button is located underneath the business' address, telephone number and website, as well as under two hyperlinks to edit this information and editing this information, as if you are a business owner to the company. At the current time, this button is white, with red lettering.


When the page begins to load, you'll see some other text-boxes appear.

, Use the scale they give you (the ratings range between 1 star and 5 stars). The submissions will not let the review be posted, without a rating.

, To help you out, as you hover over the rating box, there will be several words that will help you explain your rating. Click the star-rating you believe should best match the conditions of your upcoming review. The ratings are as follows:


1-star: Eek! Methinks not!
2-star: Meh! I've experienced better.
3-star: A-Ok.
4-star: Yay! I'm a fan.
5-star: Woohoo! As good as it gets!
Don't be too easy, as there is always room for improvement.
There have been several companies that have 5-star ratings, but don't let the 5-star rating be the only rating you give the companies you review.

, Below the review, you'll find a place to write a text-based review-box. The box may contain up to 5001 characters. (See writing a Review Update below if you want to add more characters than that.)


Good things to think about depend on business type, but most answer the overall questions: How was the overall experience?; How was the atmosphere?; Were the waiters cleanly dressed and well-mannered?; Were the ticket booths adequately stocked?; Were the restrooms clean?; For transportation items (bridges and tunnel systems leading up to the business), were the road you traveled on, well maintained?

As you read other reviews, you'll find that experienced writers get good ""compliments"" on these key points, as well as many other things that may not appear on the list at all.
Don't be too harsh––be firmly fair in your opinion.

, If you would like to save your review for another time, there is a way to save this review as a draft. Right underneath the textual full review, there should be one of two links. One link that ends with ""Save Now"" allows you to save the review as a draft. If there is no link, but words saying ""Auto saved a moment ago"" or ""Auto saved (x) minutes ago"", you're all set! In this case, Type a space in the box above, and click the ""Save Now"" button.


If you saved this item as a draft, and would like to return to this item, on the Yelp home page (on the right-hand side), you'll find a link that states how many unfinished reviews you have click this link. However, keep track of this number. You don't want to just save reviews. Submit them once-in-a-while.
Towards the top of the page, you'll find your drafted review. In the same box nearby, should be a button marked ""Finish my Review"". Click this button.
As you see on this page, the questions will not sync (if answered before), as well as your picture suggestions will not sync (if more than 3 pictures in their collections, these pictures will change). Finish your review and click ""Publish"" to finalize publishing this review.

, Below this, you'll find a box to share this with all of your friends on Facebook. In another tab, open and log in to Facebook, then return to this review in this other tab (make sure you save your email for future use). Once again on this checkbox, click the box to place a checkmark in the box.


Several pop-up windows from Facebook, should now display. These pop-ups allow Facebook access to sharing this information on your wall. As these boxes come up, just click ""Allow access"" in the bottom right hand corner of the displayed box.

, Below this, you'll find some optional pictures to let Yelp know how helpful it would be, for a person to make their decision with visiting the company. The pictures correspond to pictures people have taken via their smartphones and posted on the site, as well as uploaded via their PCs.


The button below that says ""Suggest as storefront photo"" can help to suggest a good photo of the business for the location's home page, if there isn't one. This picture, once approved by a Yelp moderator, will add the picture to the page, or can change the picture entirely (after approval by Yelp moderators).

, These questions are optional, but they'll help others decipher problems. Once enough people have answered these questions, Yelp admins will display the answers to the most-selected items on the business' page that you found. These questions pertain specifically to this individual location. These questions are easy to answer. These questions should only take you a minute or two to complete.


Not all questions will tend to be displayed. There sometimes will be more hidden by default in back of the ""Show more survey questions"" link. Click the link to open the remainder of the questions.

Identify your company-wide goals and objectives before beginning a social media presence.,
Identify your target demographic.,
Start and begin using your social media accounts.,
Integrate your social media accounts into your Internet marketing strategy.",How to Create a Social Media Strategy Map1," Research and development of social media is the first tier of your social media strategy map. For start-ups and new businesses you will need to ask yourself some important questions to identify your strategy.


Decide your place in your market. Decide if you are a leader, innovator, follower, customer service leader, educational leader, non-profit or community-centered organization. You can be more than 1 thing, but you should decide on 1 or 2 goals within your market, because you cannot cover all areas.
Write down your value proposition to your customers. Ask what your customers achieve through buying your product. A business should look to increase the benefit to customers if they are not able to answer this important question.
Develop a message for your customers, based on value and your business strategy. Break this down into 7 to 10 smaller messages that you can communicate to your customers via technology, such as your website, email blasts and social media. A website, database and, possibly, lead capture software should be active before signing up for social media accounts.;
, Social media is only valuable if you are reaching your demographic of usual customers. For example, a demographic between the ages of 20 to 40 would mean you should develop a presence on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest and more.


If you identify your target demographic as above 65, then you are likely to have less success with social media. Social media is not a good idea for every business. An older demographic may respond better to direct mail, newspaper ads or email blasts.

, Make sure you have an administrator on each account that is given the company messages that should be delivered. Make sure to mix your content with educational, interesting and product/service messages.


The first few weeks of a social media account are critical in setting up your tone. While you have fewer followers you should fill in all the information boxes, add company pictures and post at least 20 times before looking for followers. Internet users are less responsive to a ""hard sell;"" they prefer community oriented pages.

, Cross-promote by posting links to your accounts on your website, e-mail blasts and printed materials.

"
"
Begin using your social media accounts as a lead generation strategy.,
Develop the third layer of your map, social media changes and growth.,
Establish added-value offers that are available via your website.,
Communicate with your social media leads via email blast, mail or phone, depending upon your product or service.",How to Create a Social Media Strategy Map2," In visual terms, think of social media integration as the second tier of your marketing strategy. By posting interesting, funny, educational and valuable content with links to your website, you deliver targeted leads to your business.

, This involves training, gathering data and analyzing your lead generation process.


Gather data from your lead capture software. Your website should be able to track where people are clicking on your links. If you do not have that capacity, sign up for a free Google Analytics account, and create links that will track who visits your website.
Ask your social media fans and followers what they would like to see in your business. Use social media as a way to grow and change according to what your customers prefer. By studying the popularity of your posts, you can gauge the best way to communicate with your fans.
Educate your employees on social media policies and social media strategy. By training the majority of employees on its use, you may also get helpful suggestions on ways to grow and improve your social media presence. Ask high-performance social media users in your company to contribute.
Gather the lead generation data from your website, lead capture software or Google Analytics account. Bring it to upper management. Create ""Social Media Champions"" in upper management, who are willing to innovate the way your company adds value to its products through social media.

, This will help to convert leads into customers. If your leads must sign up for an account to get a free trial, free account, free song, free video or other offer, then you can gather their contact details.


Make sure your fee value-added content somehow relates to your product or service. You want to attract people who would also be interested in what your website offers.

, Offer products or services that are similar to what interested them in your website. This is the way you convert social media leads to sales.


The process of converting a social media lead to a customer is often called a social media funnel. The goal of the funnel is to attract new leads and pull customers back into the funnel with new offers. Eventually, you should have a good base of repeat customers.

"
"
Gather the data of how many leads you acquired and how many leads turned into sales.,
Adjust your strategy map.,
Study a rise in profitability over 3 months to a year.",How to Create a Social Media Strategy Map3," If you have a high rate of conversion, then your map is leading you on the right path toward profitability. If you have a low rate of sales conversion, then you should adjust your map.


Visualize the top tier of your map as business/shareholder profitability. The end goal of social media strategy is to deliver increased profitability to your business and shareholders.

, Try to identify if you are hitting the wrong demographic, if you need to add value to your product or service or if you need to adjust your communication strategy. Try 1 thing at a time, so that you can isolate your problem area.

, It takes at least a few months to gain a good online presence. Measure your increased profitability, which is the top tier of your social media strategy map.


If you do not have increased profitability in 1 year, study your value proposition to your customers. Also, make sure you are targeting the proper demographic. You may want to keep social media as only a small portion of your marketing strategy.
If you do have increased profitability, consider establishing a dedicated social media department. As soon as overall marketing messages are created, they can be tasked with communicating them to potential leads and increasing lead generation.

Post links to photos or videos.",How to Gain Karma on Reddit," Karma refers to points received from upvotes, which are the Reddit equivalents of ""likes"" on Facebook. You receive approximately one point of karma for each upvote, and you lose about one point of karma for each downvote., You can receive different types of karma from the following types of posts:Post Karma - Posting an external link or creating a text-only post and then receiving upvotes will grant you ""post"" karma.

Comment Karma - Posting a comment on an existing post or link and receiving upvotes will result in ""comment"" karma.

, One of the easiest ways to give your comments visibility when you're starting out is to leave a thought-provoking comment or image on other users' existing posts.


This method is less likely to earn you large amounts of karma all at once, but it will serve to build up your karma score over time while simultaneously establishing you as a dedicated user.

, Your links and comments should add something of value to Reddit's overall content base. Posts that fall outside of Reddit's commonly accepted posting rules (also known as ""reddiquette"") tend to receive downvotes.You'll also want to refrain from violating Reddit's terms of use, since doing so will at the very least result in downvotes.
It's okay to criticize, so long as the criticism is presented in a civil manner. The exception to this rule is comedic posting, though even these posts must err on the side of civility.

, Reddit is a community based around idealistic discussion and expansion of any given topic. Posting well-researched, well-thought-out content may not rake in upvotes, but it will serve to show other users that you're worth listening to.


The more users who consider you a valuable resource, the larger your future posts' audience--and, therefore, potential for upvotes--will be.

, When you facilitate a conversation, continuing it will both add to the conversation and net you upvotes based on your responses. It's important to be respectful of others' opinions while doing so.


It's okay (and encouraged) to disagree with others, so long as you present an educated counter-argument in a respectful manner.
Ignore negative or provocative comments, as responding to them--even if you're in the right--will likely result in downvotes.

, A ""karma bomb"" is created when you respond to a prospective top comment soon after it is posted. If the comment does indeed receive a large number of upvotes, your response will likely receive upvotes due to its proximity.


For this strategy to work, you'll need to gauge the likelihood of a comment receiving mass positive reception, which will take time and practice.
This is a high-risk, high-reward tactic: if the comment receives negative attention and the resulting downvotes, you'll also probably receive downvotes.

, Since Reddit presents links in the form of the title you add, the context provided for the title will often set up the tone for the discussion.


Consider using humor in these titles (e.g., puns or irony). Witty or surprising posts tend to receive upvotes.

, As with any social media platform, users enjoy visual media. Using a creative or informative title in conjunction with an engaging visual is a good way to capture users' interest and earn upvotes.

Set up the receiver indoors.,
Install a volume control box outside.,
Install a multi-channel amplifier if you are running multiple pairs of speakers.,
Obtain enough speaker wire.,
Run your speaker wire from the receiver to the outside area.",How to Install Outdoor Speakers1," Most outdoor speaker systems run off an existing indoor receiver. Since the receiver is a sensitive piece of electronics, you almost always want to set the receiver up indoors. A multi-zone receiver allows you to have music playing outside while something else plays inside.;
, Make sure that it is in a sheltered location. You will be running the speaker wire from the receiver to the volume control box, and then from the volume control box to the associated speakers. Most volume control boxes can be easily mounted on an outdoor wall.


Consider multiple volume control boxes for multiple pairs of speakers. This will allow you to control the volume across multiple zones.

, Each pair you add increases the chance of overloading the receiver's built-in amplifier. You can install the amplifier right next to the receiver and then run the speaker wire out of the amplifier.

, 16-gauge is fine for less than 80 feet (24 m), but longer wires should be 14- or 12-gauge. If you don't use the right gauge for your speakers, your audio quality will suffer. The longer the wire, the more degradation will occur.


Four-conductor wire allows you to connect two pairs of speakers with one wire, potentially saving you the hassle of running a lot of wire.
For outdoor speakers, CL2 and CL3 speaker wire complies with US in-wall standards, which means it can be safely ran through walls without causing issues with other electronics or posing a fire risk. This wire can also withstand elements, which is essential for an outdoor setup.
Add an additional 10-15% to the length for snags and slack. You don't want your speaker wire to be pulled tight, as crimps in the wire can affect sound quality.

, Drill a hole low in the wall to run the speaker wire from the inside to the outside. Make sure to seal the hole with silicone to maintain your house's insulation. Run the speaker wire to the volume control box, and then run a second wire from the box to the speakers.


Don’t run speakers through windows or door jambs. This can cause your speaker wire to get crimped, causing audio issues.
Some modern speaker setups are completely wireless, and operate using Bluetooth. If you are using a setup like this, you don't have to worry too much about wiring. You just need to ensure that your receiver supports Bluetooth speakers, and that the speakers are setup relatively close to the receiver. Bluetooth can reach about 150 feet (45.7 m) if there is nothing impeding the signal. Walls between the receiver and speaker will shorten the effective range.

Tilt the speakers down to promote drainage.,
Mount according to the instructions.,
Connect speakers using banana plugs.",How to Install Outdoor Speakers2," Even though most outdoor speakers are designed to withstand the elements, you will get a lot more life out of them if you protect them a little. Try to place your speakers under eaves or underneath the patio roof to help protect the speakers from the weather.

, Speakers should be about 8-10 feet (2.5-3 m) apart. If the speakers are too close together, the sound will be muddled and the speakers will overlap. If the speakers are too far apart, it will be difficult to hear and you will lose any stereo effects.

, A pair of speakers covers two channels: left and right. The two of these together creates a stereo sound. When installing more than a single pair of speakers, it is important to alternate left and right channels to ensure a proper stereo mix. This becomes especially important if you are installing a large number of speakers.


If you are installing more than one speaker along a wall, alternate left and right channels along that wall.
If you are installing speakers in a box around your patio, install the two left channels in opposing corners, and the two right channels in the other opposing corners.

, Make sure that the sound quality and projection is acceptable before mounting the speaker. Listening before installing can save you a lot of time and headache when you turn the system on for the first time.


More speakers is better than higher volume. If you are having difficulty hearing the sound everywhere you want, consider adding another pair of speakers instead of trying to crank the volume to the max.

, Mounting your speakers high allows the sound to project much further, which can give you more coverage for less speakers. If you mount them near or above 10 feet (3 m), however, you will lose a lot of the bass. Try to keep your speakers between 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m) off the ground.

, This will also provide a better listening experience, and help minimize noise pollution for your neighbors. Most brackets allow you to mount at an angle, and many contain swivels that you can position exactly how you want.

, The mounting process will vary depending on the type of bracket, but you'll usually need to drill into the mounting location. This may mean you will need a drill bit that can penetrate masonry.


Only mount speakers on solid wood or masonry. Avoid mounting on cedar or aluminum siding, otherwise the speakers may start to sag. This can cause vibrations, which will lower the sound quality, or the speakers can fall entirely.
Use the included brackets. Outdoor speaker brackets are already treated for weather. If you try to replace the brackets with ones not designed for outdoor use, they may rust and become weak.

, These provide a much more reliable connection than bare wire, which is essential for outdoor speakers. Banana plugs connect directly into the speaker wire clips on the back of the speaker and receiver.


To install banana plugs, you will need to strip the end of the speaker wires. Each speaker wire has two wires: a red and a black. Pull them apart to separate them and give you some room to work. Each of these will need to be stripped about 3/4 of an inch from the end of the wire.
Once the wire is stripped, unscrew the end of the banana plug and slip the exposed wire into the end. Once the wire is inserted, tighten the banana plug screw. Repeat this for the other exposed wire.

Check your speaker and receiver specifications.,
Check the connections.,
Look for physical damage.",How to Install Outdoor Speakers3," There are a variety of factors that could potentially be causing your speakers to sound distorted or fuzzy. Mismatched equipment is one of the most common factors. Check that the amplifier and receiver support the ohms that the speakers draw, and that the speakers can handle the wattage output of the amplifier. Check the documentation for all of your equipment to ensure that everything matches.

, If you've accidentally swapped the positive and negative wires on your speakers, you likely will not hear anything coming out of them. Double check all of your connections, and ensure that the black cables are inserted in black clips, while the red cables are inserted in the red clips.If the speaker is too far away and you aren't using a proper gauge wire, you can experience a lot of distortion. Try to move the speaker closer to the receiver and then shorten the wire, or run newer, lower-gauge wire.
Crossed wires can short out your speakers and cause serious damage. Make sure the black and red wires are not touching when bare at the ends.

, Check that the speakers are not physically damaged. A blown-out speaker can sound terrible, so ensure that the woofers on the speaker aren't torn. If you see any physical damage, try replacing the speaker.

Choose which drivers that are best for your computer.,
Download the drivers.,
After the download is complete you must go through the complicated phase of being able to run the driver installation.,
After you have put the drivers on the disk and finalized it, you must run the drivers off the disk.",How to Install Drivers for Hardware from a Website,", There are several ways of doing this, the easiest is to see if it came in a box and that will give all the information you need. Sometimes the hardware has the brand and maybe even the model number if you can find it.

, Usually the website is just the manufacturer's name plus a "".com"" For example, if you had an hp 1100 deskjet, you would go to hp.com. Also, if you had a Msi ATI 1300 video card, you would go to the msi website. If the manufacturer's website plus "".com"" doesn't work, go to a search website such as google.com, and type in the manufacturer's name and usually the first result is the website you want to go to.

, Once you are at the website, find the support section, this is typically at the top of the screen, and click. Find the text box that tells you to find support for your product or something like that. Type in the product model number and select your product from the search results. Once you are at the product home page, find the section for the list of drivers.

, There are probably many driver downloads available, so you have to be careful about which ones you are going to download and install. First, find all the drivers that have your operating system listed. To narrow it down more, choose which driver is the higher version number for your operating system. Sometimes it shows 32 bit and 64 bit on the drivers, determine if your computer is 32 or 64 bit and choose from there.

, Once you have found the driver for your system, click the download button right next to the driver. Sometimes you will have to go through a series of download links to download it. If you click the download button and your website browser shows the website is trying to download the file, have the browser accept it. In a few seconds, depending on your computer, a box will show up asking if you want to save the file you are downloading or possibly run it, choose save and find a location you can easily find on your hard rive.

, Go to the wikiHow article on how to burn files to a disk and follow the instructions to put all the driver files you created onto a blank CD-ROM.

, This step is necessary on most driver applications because when searching for the driver files, it only looks on the disk drive, not the hard disk drive where you would try to run the application from. Insert your disk into the CD-R CD, Combo, etc bay. Go to computer or my computer and right click your CD drive and then click open. Double click the file in the driver's folder that is and application and it will start the installation for your wonderful piece of hardware.
