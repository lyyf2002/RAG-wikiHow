Find out how many of your visitors are going where you want them to go.",How to Get Useful Information from Google Analytics," When people search for specific words or phrases in a search engine (like Google or Bing) and click on a result that pops up, the words they searched for are called keywords, and the visitors are called organic traffic.


Your website should show up highly among search results for the keywords that your business is all about. The keywords your visitors use to find your website can potentially indicate market demand, and thus where your business should focus.
Note that for small business websites with little or no search engine optimisation (SEO), most traffic to their websites will be direct; where the visitors weren’t searching for a keyword, but rather they knew they wanted to visit that business’ website.;
, The visitors of your website, called your audience, can be anyone from anywhere in the world. But the people who should be visiting your website are your target market. You can use the demographic, geographic and behaviour data to determine whether the visitors to your website are who you were targeting.


The developer of your website will also use audience data from the analytics to determine if the website is designed and developed in the best way for them.

, If the navigation (menus and individual links and buttons) is well-designed, then visitors will be able to go to any place within your website. The pages they choose to visit are likely to be the pages they came for, or the pages that seem most attractive. The visitors may also interact with the content in your webpages, such as using the website search, and filling in forms.


You should use the popularity of the content of your website to decide if the website is fulfilling its purpose; whether that is to inform them, entertain them, create a social community for them, or sell your products and services to them.

, The content mentioned above can frustrate visitors if it isn’t as good as they’re expecting. What they think and feel during their visit is called their user experience (UX), and poor UX is often caused by basic design problems and technical problems.


Indications of this frustration are people leaving your website from a particular page, called exits, and people leaving from the same page that they just arrived at your website on, called bounces.
Unfortunately it’s usually almost impossible to see why a visitor left your website from a particular page, which is why your website should be tested with user groups before significant redesign launches.

, As mentioned above, your website should have a purpose, and thus goals that you’d like it to achieve, called conversion. Most website goals can be written in terms of analytics metrics such as visiting a particular number of information pages, completing the buying process, or simply visiting the contact page and filling in the contact form. You should track the percentage of visitors that achieve a goal, to determine how much work you need to spend improving the website.

In order to qualify for Google AdSense, your website must have a lot of quality content. Streamline your website so Google AdSense will generate appropriate ads relevant to your content.


Find a niche and center your site on that subject. If you don't already know what you want to base your website around, research through keywords what would be popular enough to bring visitors to your site. Use Google AdWords and the traffic estimator to help devise effective keywords and a subject that will drive traffic to your site.;
, Consider placement, color and design. Test the placement of the ads to determine which placement brings the most clicks on each ad. What works for one site may not work for another. The placement that works is the one that brings in the most ad clicks.


Test the colors after you have determined the best place for your ads. Try the color that you are currently using for your links. This can create a more blended look to your website. Try other colors and use the one that brings in the most ad clicks. Match the background color to the ad theme.

, Keywords that are competitive are keywords that are searched for the most. In turn, competitive keywords will create ads that will earn more per click. Choose words or phrases that are not too competitive, though, or you may lose traffic to competing websites. Use high grade keywords throughout your site.


Add quality links to your website; this gives your website more clout. The better the quality of your website, the more return visitors it will have, which in turn increases the chances of ads being clicked.

, You can link your site to social networks but realize this may not bring the targeted traffic that will click on your ads. Register your website to search engines so your site can be found in searches. The key to getting traffic is ranking high in search engines, which will help bring more ad clicks so you can profit with Google AdSense.

,


Some AdSense users recommend using no border around ads when you use a light-colored background. When you use a darker background, the consensus is to border your ads.
Additionally, using borders for in-text ads can distract visitors, while bordering ads on the sides of your page can draw positive attention to the ads.

",How to Create a Filter in Google Analytics,",,,,,


Predefined filters allow you to filter report data from a specific domain, specific IP addresses, or specific directories on your website. For example, if your website sells athletic products but you just want to view report data for the directory that sells athletic shoes, you can choose to exclude all other directories.
Custom filters have advanced options that allow you to customize your filters, such as including or excluding visitors based on the browser they use, their connection speed, their geographical location, and more. For example, if you are organizing a local sporting event through your website, you can filter visitors from your city.

,

,


You can choose to exclude or include traffic from domains, traffic from IP addresses, or traffic to subdirectories.

,,

,,"";
,


The ""Exclude"" and ""Include"" options allow you to specify certain data for exclusion or inclusion from your reports. For example, if you don't want to see data for visitors from a specific city, select ""Exclude"" and type in the name of that city. If you just want to see data for visitors from a specific country, select ""Include"" and type in the name of that country.
The ""Lowercase"" and ""Uppercase"" options allow you to combine case-sensitive Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that all land on the same page or directory. This can be useful if visitors use a combination of lowercase or uppercase characters to land on a specific page on your website. For example, if users type AthleticShoes.html or athleticshoes.html into their browser to view your directory for athletic shoes, the URLs will be combined in your report data.
The ""Search and Replace"" option allows you to customize the way you view data in your reports. For example, if you have a section for commonly asked questions on your website and it is split up between 2 different pages or URLs, you can type the name of one URL into the ""Search"" field and the other URL into the ""Replace"" field to display both URLs as one in your report data.
The ""Advanced"" option allows you to narrow report data results by using specific fields and criteria you indicate. For example, if you received over 500 visitors and 400 of those visitors were referred from a specific website, you can filter data to only show the activity of those referred visitors.

,


For example, if you chose the ""Exclude"" option, specify a filter field from the drop-down menu such as ""Visitor Country"" and type the name of the country into the ""Filter Pattern"" field.

A Google account allows you to use all of Google’s services, including Google AdSense. You can do this through Google.
You will use your Google account to log in to Google AdSense after you have an account.;
, Google will look more favorably on your site if you’ve owned it for six months before you try to get Google Adsense.


It’s not impossible to get approval for sites that you’ve owned a shorter time, but it does increase your chances if you’ve owned the site longer.
If you live in some countries, like China or India, you may be required to meet the six-month threshold of ownership.

, You must have access to edit HTML source code of the web pages you’re seeking ads for. You won’t be able to use Google AdSense if submitting an account you don’t own and if you don't have access to that function.


If you don’t already have a blog or website that allows you to edit HTML source code, you could set up a new blog through the Google service, Blogger. You will be able to display Google ads without copying or pasting HTML code on this site. It’s fast and free to sign up for a Blogger account. You don’t need a blogger site if you have a website or other blog that allows you to edit HTML source code.
Once you’ve created a site on Blogger, you will need to enable AdSense on your blog.To use Google Adsense on You Tube, apply for the You Tube Partner Program or follow instructions displayed on You Tube for applying to AdSense.

, First, go to https://www.google.com/adsense/start/. You will be asked what type of advertiser you are.


You can submit an application to Google AdSense online.Select the type of advertiser that describes you best, such as new, experienced, etc. Click on ""get started.""
You can use Google AdSense even if your site already displays Google ads. But publishers can only have one account under each name.You will be asked to pick the ad types and formats that you want on your site. If you choose more options, you will have more chances to make money. Ad types that are available include display ads, text-only ads or ads that are a mixture. , You must provide your phone number and the postal address of your bank. This is necessary for you to get paid.


You will be asked to provide a full address for your bank account, including the zip codeYou will be asked to provide your website URL and to choose the language you want the ads in.
Customize your ads. You can change how your ads look and how they feel, and you can also choose where you want them to show up on your site. You can use automatic targeting to make sure that the ads which appear are relevant to the users of your site.

, AdSense only allows people who are at least 18 years or older to have an account.


If you are under the age of 18, a parent or guardian can submit an application through their own Google account. If they are approved, the payments will go to the parent’s account.
The system will flag sites that are negative, non-family safe or could be considered offensive. Examples of prohibited content include hacking, drugs, alcohol, copyrighted materials, weapons, and content condoning illegal activity., You will need to have original content that complies with the program policies of Google AdSense in order to qualify for the program.


The content can be hosted on a website, a blog, or other space. If you’re just copying and pasting a lot of other people’s stuff, though, you might not get approved. Don’t use copyrighted images, either.
Create subpages on your website that make it look more professional. Google is going to look at all pages of your website to judge its professionalism. So there are some pages you can create that help give this impression.
Create a privacy and disclaimer policy on your website, as well as a page devoted to terms of usage. Proofread all pages so they are clear of spelling and grammar errors.
Make sure the contact us page has clear information about who you are. Google AdSense wants to make sure it can verify who you are. Similarly, you should have an about us page, and use your name and address on it that match that which you used to apply for Google AdSense. Make the website’s mission clear.

, It’s important that your website or blog has a large number of quality articles with original content. If you’re just posting work other people do, you’re less likely to get approved.


Experts recommend that you have between 15 to 40 quality, original articles on your site before applying. However, there is no guarantee about that your application will be approved after 40 posts. There are many bloggers who got approved accounts with just 10-12 posts and some who were rejected with 100 posts. Everything depends upon the quality of your site and content. Make sure that every web page of your site contains a good amount of content. Your web pages should not be empty or thin in quality.
It’s a good idea to write 1000+ words articles to publish on your blog. Focus on good content. It’s a good idea to have about 50 pages on your website for subpages and articles, at least. If you have a lot of short posts (less than 200 words), they might not be considered rich content by Google.

, Obviously, you need to be working in an area that you’re passionate about. However, if you have a lot of quality articles in certain categories, Google AdSense might approve you faster.


Some categories that interest Google AdSense include travel, lifestyle, health, law, and business.
If you have prohibited content on your site, such as pornography or hate speech targeting a group of people, get prepared for a denial. You might face rejection if you’re just blogging about events too.

, Strong content should have a mixture of text and other media (such as photographs).


The site isn’t going to look fondly on a page that has a lot of text with no imagery.
You also want a balanced amount of external and internal links on your site. You site might be deemed more spam-oriented if you have a lot of external links on a page. Make sure your site doesn’t have broken links.

, If you have more users, your chances will improve. However, you don’t need really high amounts of traffic to get Google AdSense. Thus, it’s a good idea if you don’t apply for Google AdSense right after you first create your website. Let your site mature a bit, and apply for Google AdSense after you’ve started gaining traffic.
Traffic will be consideration for approval. One rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t apply until you have at least 30-50 people who visit your site each day., If you are using a free domain name, your site won’t be taken as seriously by Google AdSense.


It only costs a few dollars to get your own domain name. Your domain name shouldn’t be long, and it should not contain sexual references. Domain names such as .com, .org, and.net are valued. Unique domain names are more desired.You should also create an email that has your domain name in it. Use this email to apply for Google AdSense.

, If you have a lot of this code on your site, you may not receive approval.


So stay away from things like Yahoo Ads, Infolinks, or other networks, especially those that are competitors to Google AdSense.
Avoid having a lot of widgets on your site, as well as affiliate links, until your site is approved.

, It matters how your website looks. If it looks clean and professional, and is designed well, Google AdSense is more likely to want its ads on your site.


Focus on creating strong navigation on your site. You don’t want it to look too cluttered or filled with dated graphics like flashing or spinning animations or glittery icons. Strong design includes a header, content section sidebar, footer, and so forth.
Stick with a professional color scheme (like primary colors), and use a professional template that you’ve installed on your website. For example, if you’re using WordPress, you can easily import different professional themes for your site.

, Google Analytics is a separate program offered through Google that allows website publishers and bloggers to track their metrics (such as user traffic).


If you have Google Analytics installed on your site, the people who approve the Google AdSense applications are likely to see you as a more serious website publisher. That’s because people who aren’t just amateurs are going to want to closely analyze their metrics.
To enroll in Google Analytics, just go to the site online and sign up.You will get tracking code that you can place on each page.
You could also sign up for the Google Webmaster program, which allows you to track critical errors to your website and fix them. You can also register online for Google Webmasters.. You could also add a sitemap to your website. If you are using WordPress, you can do this through Google XML Sitemaps., You will need to click on the “my ads” section of your AdSense account. Find the ad code (this is embed code). You need to put this on a page that receives traffic.


Place the ad code on the site that you are using to sign up for AdSense. You should carefully select the page you choose. You will want a page that has both content and receives regular visitors.
If you don’t place the ad code on an active page, it could take you a long time to get approved, if at all.You will be notified by email.

, Search engine optimization shows that you’re serious about your site.


The Google AdSense reviewers will look for things like whether you have a meta-description and meta title.
Keep your meta title at about 69 characters, including spaces, and keep your metal description about 156 characters, including spaces.

, Once you’ve signed in to your AdSense account for the first time, you will see a red bar at the top of your account. This means that you application is under review.


Google Adsense will start an automatic review after it detects that you’ve posted the ad code on a live in page of the site you’ve used to sign up. The entire site will be reviewed, though, not just that page.
It usually takes about 1-2 days for the review to be completed. You will get an email with details after your site is reviewed. If you application is reviewed, you will start seeing ads appear automatically on your site. You won’t see the red alert in your account anymore
Once your application is fully approved, ads will automatically start to show in your AdSense for content ad units, and the red alert in your account will disappear.

For example, if your blog is adult-oriented or illegal, Google reserves the right to deny you entry into the AdSense program. You can read more about Google AdSense policies on their website.;
, AdSense runs on a pay-per-click system, meaning you only get paid when people click on the advertisements on your blog. One way to increase the number of clicks you receive is to increase the total number of visitors to your website.


Write high quality and unique content. In order to draw in as many visitors as you can, your blog must be full of unique content that visitors cannot find anywhere else. Not only that, but your content must be high quality. Uniqueness will draw them in and high quality will keep them coming back for more.
Optimize your content for search engines. There is an entire paradigm of blog design known as Search Engine Optimization (SEO) which works to make sure that your blog content will be indexed by search engines and shown to visitors who search for relevant keywords.
Promote your blog on the Internet. When you visit another blog that covers topics related to your own blog, you may want to comment on their blog posts and leave a link back to yours. Seek out forums and communities that fall into your target niche and let them know that you're running a related blog.

, The AdSense program allows you to choose where to display the advertisements and the color scheme of the advertisements. Changing the location of your advertisements can mean the difference between numerous clicks and no clicks at all. Choose a location that is free from clutter and immediately visible upon visit.


The recent trend with AdSense bloggers is to place their advertisement locations in line with their blog posts. For example, you may want to put your advertisements below every post on your blog. This way, the advertisements are visible yet they blend in with the blog's design.
Place your advertisements near the top and left of the main page. According to research conducted by Google, advertisements in these locations tend to fare better than elsewhere. This is likely due to the advertisements' immediate visibility upon visiting the blog.

, If you're blogging on mobile technology but your advertisements are for pet health and pet care, your visitors are not likely to click. On the other hand, if you're blogging about computer games and your advertisements are for high quality keyboards and mice, you're more likely to catch your visitors' eyes.


One way to ensure that AdSense delivers relevant advertisements to your blog is to make sure that your blog's content is specific and focused. Instead of running a golf blog, you may want to run a golf blog for women or a blog dedicated to reviewing golf clubs. The more specific your content is, the more targeted your advertisements will be.

Analyze your content.,
Fine tune advertisements.,
Optimize your ad placement and site design.,
Learn how AdSense works.",How to Earn Money Through Google Adsense2," In designing any kind of ad campaign, it's crucial to know who your target is. If you're writing a food blog that caters to single men on a budget, for example, you've narrowed the scope of who you will be appealing to. You've also got a very good focal point for your ads. What are things single men who cook drawn to? Here are some possibilities: dating, cars, movies, politics, and live music.


Think about who frequents your website, write down what you feel are the most important characteristics of your viewers.

, While AdSense will auto-populate your page with what they feel are relevant ads, use their tools to provide tighter controls.


Set up channels. Channels are like labels that let you group your ad units your way—by color, category, or pages. By setting up channels, you can get detailed reports on the performance of your ad units, and use that to your advantage. For example:

Use one style of ad on one group of pages, and another style on another group. Track and compare the performance of the two styles, and pick the best performer.
Compare performance on pages that focus on different things. For example, if your pages about gardening perform better than your pages on cooking, you might consider adding more to your gardening pages.
If you have separate domains, set up a channel to track each of them to see which is generating the most clicks.



, Google has found there are places where ads are more effective, and places where they are less effective.


Ads that appear when you first arrive at your page (i.e., ""above the fold"" as they say in the newspaper world) tend to be more effective than those that are below the fold.
Ads on the upper-left tend to perform much better than ads on the lower right.
Ads directly above the primary content, and ads that appear at the bottom of the page and above the footer tend to perform very well.
Wider ads are generally more successful, as they are much easier to read.
Ads that display images or video perform very well.
Using colors that complement your website colors will make them more readable, and so more effective.

, AdSense automatically sends ads to your site based on a few different criteria:



Contextual targeting. AdSense crawlers scan your page, analyze your content, and serve up ads designed match your content. They do this using keyword analysis, word frequency, font size, and the link structure of the web.

Placement targeting. This allows advertisers to choose to run their ads on specific subsections of a publisher's website. If your website matches an advertiser's criteria, their ad will appear on your page.

Interest-based advertising. This lets advertisers reach users based on their interests and the user's previous interactions with them, such as a visit to their website. Google's Ads Preferences Manager allows users themselves to choose their interest categories, which further helps advertisers focus their ad campaigns. This method is good for monetizing your site more efficiently, as it increases the value for advertisers and provides a more relevant experience for users.

Manage your expectations.,
Traffic.,
Cost Per Click (CPC).,
Click-through Rate (CTR).,
Revenue per 1000 impressions (RPM).,
Content is king.,
Start building keyword-rich pages.",How to Earn Money Through Google Adsense3," When you sign up for AdSense, you'll want to know what kind of revenue can you expect to see. There is a lot that goes into what kind of return you can expect, and managing those things will help you maximize your earning potential.

, First and foremost, in order to generate any kind of revenue from AdSense, you must have people clicking on your ads. In order for this to happen, you need to have people on your site, reading your content! Whether you have a business website or a personal blog, the rule is the same: Get the word out!


Heavily trafficked large sites can see over a million hits a day, whereas a blog might feel lucky if they have 100 visitors a day.
For every thousand page impressions (views) you receive, you may earn from $.05 to $5. Yes, that's a broad range—over a month, that is between $1.50 and $150.00! Where in that range you can expect to frequent depends entirely on you, your site, and your promotion efforts.

, This paid every time somebody clicks an ad on your page. No, you can't click your own ad—Google will see this, and shut you down so fast your head will spin. The advertisers set the price for these ads, and they can vary greatly.


An advertiser may spend a lot on a per-click basis, but that ad may generate very little interest on your site.
An ad that may generate $.03 per click may get 100 hits, but that doesn't add up to much.

, This is the percentage of visitors to your site compared to how many of them actually clicked on an ad. If 100 people came to your site, and 1 of them clicked an ad, your CTR is 1%, and that's not an unreasonable number. You can see how getting more traffic to your site will really make a difference.

, This is an estimate of how much you might receive if you have 1000 impressions (page views).


If you made, for example, $1 for 100 impressions, your RPM would be $10. There is no guarantee you'll make that, but it's a good way to check the overall performance of your site.

, The quality of your content is an important factor in understanding your earning potential. If your site provides rich, compelling content and a great user experience, you will have more interested users. Google's crawlers will also have an easier time determining the type of ad content would best fit on your site. Interested users + targeted ads = $$$

, Liberally seed with well researched, profitable keywords, and get lots of high-quality links to your site.


If your site is about topics such as debt consolidation, web hosting or asbestos-related cancer, you’ll earn much more per click than if it’s about free puppies.
If you concentrate only on top-paying keywords, you’ll face stiff competition. What you want are keywords that are high in demand and low in supply, so do some careful keyword research before you build your pages.

Choose a good username.,
Prepare the right sort of profile picture.,
Tell a story through the pictures you post.,
Describe yourself simply and effectively.,
Be honest and don't make up stories.,
Be clear about the type of partner you have in your mind.,
Be open to connecting with potential partners on on a social media platform.",How to Write an Online Dating Profile for Men," Never appear too desperate, like (hotguywaiting23) or boasting like (coolguy8). Choose a username which shows that you are honest and funny. Be very sharp about selecting this name; do not think it's just a username and it does nothing for you, as it is part of the whole package when people check out your profile. The best choice is a name that makes people smile.


Some examples might be: SensitiveGuy45, Handsomeonce56, Certaintoloveyou*6, Funlovinghippie or FriendlySoul22.
Avoid choosing a name that sounds abusive or dirty.;
, Don't try to put all of your body in a photo. Just take the head (face) and ensure that it is a shot showing you with a smile. It will tell those viewing your picture that you are approachable.


Putting on a serious expression can work sometimes but avoid appearing boastful, vain or deadly dull.

, Put in photos taken with your friends, hanging out with buddies, doing the things you enjoy such as exercise, football, gardening, etc. Try to add photos which describe the real you. You might even post some funny pictures where you are dressed up as a clown or something else amusing.


Avoid selfies where you are half naked or shirtless.This will give the impression that you might be a flirt or self-absorbed.

, In the ""About me"" section, do not write a long paragraph describing yourself. Instead, focus on keeping it clear and simple. Talk about your interests and highlight three great things about yourself.

, Just explain who you are, proudly .If you do not know how to dance, then don't add it as a pastime of yours. More importantly, never say you are good at or love something just to sound impressive; you really must enjoy or be able to do that activity.

, This will make things easier and you will sound exclusive rather than the type who feels that it's easy come, easy go.


This means explaining the character and behavior traits you are hoping for in a partner. Words such as ""sexy"", ""hot"" or ""buffed"" are not useful in this context and can scare off potential partners.

, Chat through facebook or WhatsApp. Slowly move on to Skype. Then, it might be time to suggest that the two of you meet each other some time and end up doing something interesting to both of you.

Know what you want.,
Try to keep the focus on him/her.,
Don't come off as needy or creepy.,
Learn when to stop and let go.,
Don't be too specific and straightforward right away.",How to Write an Introductory Email on an Online Dating Site," This should be self-explanatory, but more often than not, people forget to be specific. What is it that you want out of sending this email? Are you sending a mass email to see who replies first or are you interested in this particular person? If you're sending a mass email, good luck. If you're genuinely interested, then he/she will think you've sent a mass email. To avoid this, make it a point that you have checked out his/her profile by commenting on something that he/she either liked or disliked (try to comment positively and make it something that you two have in common).;
, Don't go on about how much you work out at the gym or how good your hair looks. That's no way to introduce yourself. Instead, try to find things you have in common or that you are curious about (be appropriate and mature here) and show him/her that you are curious about them (they will think it's flattering).

, If you start off with  ""I'm so lonely and need someone to talk to. Will you please go on a date with me or at least respond back to my email"" then you've already struck out. Being confident is what sells, but don't be overly confident. But don't try to be sell yourself as someone else, tell them who you are and be upfront. Don't pretend to like something or be someone you're know just to score a date. That's not fun for you and eventually it will catch up with you.

, Even if you think the person you sent the email to could be the love of your life, you have to prepare yourself for the harsh reality of rejection - not hearing back from him/her. If they don't respond the first time, it's not a good idea to send another email until they respond - if this is your goal, then you won't ever be successful. Again, if they didn't respond the first time, what makes you think harassing he/she is a successful way to create a spark? It's possible to get kicked off the dating site by sending such emails, too. It's not worth it.

, Though most people will respond well to physical compliments, doesn't mean it should be your default introduction. If he/she has posted a stunning picture, creepy remarks such as, ""When I look into your beautiful eyes, I see a new world and I want to explore this new beautiful world."" This doesn't help you, it hurts you and your credibility. Unless you want a one-way ticket to the trash icon, then focus on something other than physical appearance.

Most sites also offer a Heading/Catch Phrase/Tag Line that appears in the searches to draw people into your profile. Humor often works best. It engages people by creating a reaction in their mind of laughter, a pleasure-seeking bait of wanting to laugh more if they read what else you have to say. I myself used: “We can always say we met at the supermarket“, or something quirky like: “Seeking out all the toilet paper scrunchers!“

,


A lot of us introverts are camera shy but having a photo is essential for any online dating profile. In most sites you can choose to filter people out without a photo. Whenever someone performs a search for a match, the only details that appear in the search results are your username, age, location, tagline and your photo. So what will make a person take more interest in learning more about you than any of the other 50 profiles in the search result? How attractive they find you. Selecting a photo with someone significantly less attractive than yourself would create the perfect perceptual contrast of increasing your appeal.

, But for the more ethical:


Current photos are ideal. Many people use old photos of their former and more attractive selves. It’s an ingenious idea at the beginning… until you have to meet the person you’re talking with, and have to reassure them that they didn’t sleep in and arrive 20 years late for your date…
More than one photo allows for people to get a more three dimensional idea of what you look like in different contexts. Preferably include at least one head shot and one full body shot.
Be original and grab people's attention to receive higher responses. This could be perfect if you’re a bit shy and don’t want to show a picture of yourself. For example, you could put one picture up of you wearing a costume, or one where you draw a smiley face on a piece of paper and cover your face with it. These kinds of pictures will add a touch of quirky playfulness, while adding a sense of mystery so that people want more.
Details in picking the image will make all the difference. If you’re aiming at attracting geeks or nerds then photos with your glasses on or playing your favorite video games will work wonders. If you’d like an adventurer like yourself, a photo of yourself rock climbing is perfect. Also keep in mind the small things like lighting in the photo, clothes you’re wearing and even the size of your pupils. A psychology study analyzing pupil sizes discovered that we find large pupils more inviting and attractive, just as I mentioned in another article.;
, How often have you seen the same repetitive: “I love to have fun and be spontaneous!!!“, as opposed to what? Not liking to have fun? And saying you’re spontaneous makes it sound planned. Listing sports, movies, music and travel as your interests is uninteresting, most people like a certain sport, movie, song or place to go to. Also, generalizing your tastes by saying for instance “I like all kinds of music” is just a falsified cover-up to make yourself appear that you’re cultured, when in fact you’re actually dispassionate and boring. Writing: “I like to visit India because it’s such an ancient culture rich with variety, spirituality, acceptance and color” would be much more revealing of who you are. Here are some helpful hints:

,


The opening lines are pivotal for the success of your self bio. Just like in many writing formats, how you open your paragraphs will either hook your reader in and entice them to read further or will dull them away. It will be difficult, but craft the first sentence very carefully.

, The length should preferably be around 300 words. The internet generation is one of impatience, nobody likes reading 3-mouse-scroll-downs lengths of text. Too little text however and you’ll come across as empty, lazy, lifeless and boring. Too much and you’re obsessive, psycho and neurotic.

, Spelling is one of the pet-peeves of many. Spelling words correctly makes your writing flow a lot more smoothly, as does using punctuation and new paragraphs. If your reader unconsciously feels the tension of having to decipher your spelling mistakes, then that anxiety will also influence their perception of you. Furthermore, your choice of words can change the meaning of what you want to convey entirely. “I don’t want to die alone” is a common fear. “I want someone to die with” is a suicide pact.

, If you consider yourself caring, instead of writing that, why not share that you enjoy cooking for your parents or coaching your nephews soccer team?

, For instance: what it is you aspire to do in life, what hobbies bring you the greatest joy, what qualities you value in others. The more important things you reveal about yourself, whether favorite movie or favorite ice cream flavor, the more chances someone will read your profile and think: “wow, this person sounds so much like me“.

, Instead of stating: “No old creepy men”, “I’d like someone around my age to be able to grow old with” sounds much more warm and positive. Instead of “No non-christians”, “My religion plays a huge role in my life” is much more welcoming.

, Be unique.

Refrain from providing your personal contact details on your profile.,
Trust your instincts.,
Use free email accounts.,
Use an anonymous phone service to chat via your mobile.,
Look for questionable characteristics.,
Request a recent photo.,
Use paid online dating services.,
When you first meet ensure you visit a public place.",How to Use Online Dating Sites Safely," Providing your home details i.e. phone number and address on your profile is an easy way for someone to track down where you live or work. Therefore, in the initial stages of online dating keep your personal information to yourself. Once you get to know your date you can determine how much information you would like to provide. Remember, even by discovering your first and last name you can be tracked on social websites. Therefore, try to create a “tag” or nickname that you can use on dating sites. In terms of phone communication, see tip 4.;
, Sometimes you just know when something is not right! It is always important to use common sense, as your instinct is a powerful tool when dating and great way to measure when to build a relationship or turn and run. As you begin to read personal profiles, respond to emails or speak on the phone your instincts will help tell you if something is right or not. If you are in any doubt, be careful, back off, or proceed carefully!

, Should you decide to move your date from the anonymous email provided by the majority of online dating services i.e. chocolate lover@oceanlovers.co.uk to providing an email address that isn't your regular one. Sign up for a free Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo!, account that you use just for online dating. Don't put your full name in the “from” field, only your first name or your “tag”. This will protect you from anyone trying to search your normal email address to find out more information about you on social websites.

, When it's time to move your communication to the next level (talking on the phone), never give out your home or work phone number. Either provide a cell phone number, use Skype to communicate, or use an anonymous phone service such as Paginglist.com. It’s just an added protection barrier until you get to know the person better.

, As you chat on the phone or via email you may be able to start to pick out characteristics of the other person. Do they seem to be short tempered? Are they controlling? Do they avoid some of your questions? Ask how long ago was their last relationship and how long did it last? If you ask a range of questions can tell you if they are Mr or Mrs Right or if it's time to move on. But try not to be too personal too soon as you don’t want to scare them off!

, If your contact does not have a photo on their profile request a recent one. It's important for you to get a good look at the person you may eventually meet. Plus your instincts from your communications and their photos may provide you with valuable insight into the person. If a person lies about their photo or profile then that is a red flag to no longer pursue the relationship.

, Free online dating services provide a greater opportunity for potentially dangerous individuals. They don't ever have to provide a credit card or other information that identifies them. There is definitely truth to the saying, ""you get what you pay for"". Use safe dating websites recommendations on facebook or twitter. Alternatively search online for recommended sites from dating magazines.

, When it's time to meet up arrange to meet in a public place and provide your own transportation. Never accept an offer to be picked up from your house on the first date. Make sure you tell someone ie a friend, where you are going. Your first meeting will tell you a great deal about the other person. Be thinking about what questions to ask your date on route!

Evaluate length.",How to Write a Bio for a Dating Site," Before writing the bio, go through the site and read about exactly how that particular platform matches individuals with their soul-mates. You could learn something that you could use to write your bio or profile.


Use available tools or templates. Some dating sites offer tools to help you put together a bio or profile. These are targeted to the site setup and might help you organize your personal details.
Use surveys or questionnaire tools. Other dating sites also offer surveys that will help you learn about yourself as you are writing.;
, It may help to compile a list of actual details that you want included in your online bio.


Avoid giving out excessive amounts of private data. Although these sites may be restricted to members, you still don't want to reveal too much personal information about yourself. Be sure to only include details that you are comfortable with revealing.
Tell the truth. Lying on online dating profiles can raise bigger issues later if you successfully find people to date. Be fair and present yourself realistically for the best results.

, Some of the best online dating bios have a real focus on practicality and clear statements about who the person is or is not looking for. There's no need to overstate this, but some kind of focus often helps.

, Another key to a winning dating site bio is using well-varied, catchy vocabulary throughout the profile. Avoid wooden-sounding phrases or cliches, and above all, be yourself.


Use humor well. Again, there is a balance: too much joking around can come off as campy or affected, while a humorless profile doesn't usually work well, either. Take a look at a range of existing bios from other writers and try to incorporate the best ones into your bio using your own unique style and expressions.

, No one is going to read through a book about your life, so keep the bio to a reasonable length.

If you choose the latter, look for an email from Airbnb; the company will send you a verification message. Click the link to verify your account.


If you already have an Airbnb account, you can simply click “Log In” from the home page and enter your information to get started.;
, If you want to host through Airbnb, a complete profile is crucial: it gives potential renters the impression that you are serious, professional, and trustworthy. Start by entering the basic, required information: your name, birthday, gender, and so on. Add your work or school information as well.

, After entering your basic information, click the “Photos and Video” button on the dashboard, which is on the left side of your screen. To add your photo, select “Take a photo with your webcam” or “Upload a file from your computer,” or, alternatively, drag and drop a photo into the box. To add a video greeting, click the “Create a new video button,” and follow the instructions.


Make sure that any photo you use is clear and that users can see your face. Again, you want to appear professional and trustworthy.

, Click on the “Trust and Verification” section of the site. Add as much verification as you can: your email address, phone number, and social media accounts. Then click the “Verify Me” button to scan and upload a copy of your driver’s license, passport, or other government-issued ID.

, The section after “Trust and Verification” is “Reviews,” but since you won’t have any of those yet, skip to the “References” section. Add email addresses for your friends and family members, and click “Send Request Emails.” Airbnb has already composed the email for you.

, The most important part of this process, of course, is to ensure that you are getting paid for hosting. Fill out this section carefully.

, Click “List Your Space” on the upper right of the home page, and choose your home type. If you have an apartment, flat, or unit in a larger building, choose “Apartment.” If you have a single-family house or a townhouse, choose “House.” If you have neither, click the drop-down menu for “Others.” Add the number of people you can accommodate, and the city where you live, then click “Continue.”

, After you click “Continue,” a message will appear that says, “We’ve created your listing. 6 more steps to list your space.” Click the blue “Finish my listing” button below the message, and go to the next step – the calendar. Choose “Always” if your listing will be available all the time, “Sometimes” if you need to specify certain dates, and “One Time” if you want to offer your space for a single finite period.

, Click on the next section, “Pricing.” Enter your desired price per night in the box, and choose the currency from the menu below.


Price your rental appropriately, offering the space for the amount that you would be willing to pay. You want, of course, to make as much money as possible, but if you charge too much, travelers will either choose a different rental or rent from you but provide negative feedback because they did not feel they got their money’s worth.

, Go to the next section, “Overview.” Create a title for your listing and type it into the first text box. Underneath that, type a summary of your listing. Scroll down to input any extra details.


Aim for a creative, eye-catching title, and optimize your summary: remember, the title and summary are the first items to appear when potential renters use search engines to find accommodations.

, Most people will not want to rent unless there are clear pictures of the space, so provide plenty of attractive photos. Click “Photos,” then the blue button that reads “Add Photos.” Browse and choose pictures of your place, upload them, and arrange the pictures by clicking and dragging them into the desired order.


The first picture you add will be the main picture of your listing and the first photo potential guests will see during their searches, so choose wisely.
You can also add captions to your pictures, so that potential guests will know what they are looking at. Simply type in the text box underneath the photo.

, Click “Amenities,” and a comprehensive list will appear, divided into four sections: common, extras, special features, and home safety. Go through the list carefully, and check all amenities available at your place.


Be honest and careful when you select your amenities. Remember, once they reserve your space, guests will expect that those amenities be available upon arrival.

, Go to “Address,” and click the blue button labeled “Add Address.” Choose your country, then enter your full street address. Click “Next” to save the information.

, Go to “Listing.” You will be prompted to enter the number of bedrooms, beds, and bathrooms and to verify type of space and the number of people you can accommodate.

, Once you have entered all the pertinent information, a yellow “List Space” button will appear on the lower left portion of your screen. You can click it to officially offer your space to renters.


If you want to review your profile and information before finalizing the listing, click the “Preview” button on the upper right side of your screen. Make sure you like what you see, then choose “List Space.”

, From your home page, you can click on “Hosting” to manage everything related to renting your space. Before you do anything else, you should familiarize yourself with Airbnb’s policies. Click on “Policy” to read about everything that is expected of you as a host.

, When you go to your profile, you will see an “Alerts” label on your dashboard. Airbnb uses the “Alerts” section to let you know if you have a message or reservation request.

, Click on the “Inbox” button to see the details of any reservation requests that have appeared. You can reply with questions if necessary, but definitely double-check your availability and respond within 24 hours.

, From the “Hosting” page, you can click on “Manage Listings” at any time to edit and update your information. Make sure to handle this task regularly, editing availability on your calendar and noting any changes in prices or amenities. Potential guests may be annoyed to discover that you haven’t maintained your listing page to reflect current availability or changes in the space.

, From the “Hosting” page, click on “Pricing” to see advanced options. Your standard nightly rate should appear there already. In addition, though, you can offer special weekly or monthly rates. Consider doing that to make travelers who want to stay for a week or more feel like they are getting a good deal.

, From the “Hosting” page, you can click on “Standby Guests” to note that you are willing to host last-minute travelers.

, If you want more people to view your listing, click on “Post to Craigslist,” and a list of options will appear. Edit any relevant information, then click the blue “Post to Craigslist” button below. When Craigslist users click on your ad, they will be redirected to your Airbnb listing.

, Every Airbnb host is ranked in search results. Click on “Search Rankings” to see your ranking and its breakdown.

, Under “Account,” you can update your account settings (including your password), change your payment preferences, view your transaction history, and see any reviews that your guests have provided.


In addition, you can click “Get Reservations” to send your listing directly to people you know.

, Once you receive a reservation request, Airbnb will provide you with contact information for your guests; once you confirm the request, your guests will receive all of your contact information and the precise address for your place. Use this information to discuss important details, including arrival and departure times and how your guests will get their keys.

, Before your guests arrive, clean and scrub all your floors, counters, and windows. Make sure your bathroom is as clean as possible. Empty all trash, and double check that you have stocked all necessary supplies: sheets, towels, paper products, etc.


Consider leaving a welcoming note and gift as well. A bottle of wine or a treat from a local bakery does a lot to set the right tone for your guests.

, If possible, welcome your guests personally, and spend a little time with them. Show them your place and give them any information they may need. If you will not see your guests in person, make sure to leave a note and a list of any information they might need.

, Once your guests are settled, let them know that they can call, text, or email you if they have any questions, problems, or concerns. Check your phone and email often to see if they have tried to reach you.

, After your guests leave, you will receive and email and an alert reminding you to review them. Provide a short and accurate review.

, Your guests will also have the opportunity to review your rental space. This review will be visible to other potential guests who are searching for accommodations on Airbnb. If there are negative components to this review, take them seriously – this is your opportunity to learn what your guests thought about your place and how you can improve the experience for future renters.

Notice his stated age and whether his profile suggest that is his true age.,
Beware of suspicious photos.,
Check his weight.,
Notice what he says he wants in a relationship.,
Read between the lines.,
Notice what he's looking for in a partner: If he says he likes women in all shapes and sizes (one in a million!)",How to Translate What a Guy Puts on His Online Dating Profile," Most dating sites have an algorithm that calculates the age of the person based the date of birth that is entered into it. Obviously, anyone can put any age they like, it's not necessarily their true age! This would have to be taken into account of the person's demeanor and what else they put in their profile.;
, As long as the picture provided is a close up of their face and it's not hidden by huge sunglasses that would make Jackie Onassis jealous or a hat reminiscent of Elton John - you would have a pretty clear idea of whether their age would be genuine. If the age provided says 19 for example but the photo has a guy with grey streaked hair and a receding hairline, unless there was a lot of genetic unluckiness for the guy - you might consider pausing before emailing him.

, If the guy has chosen the top weight range and being with an overweight person is not on your agenda - then don't email him. He's been honest with you so you must return the favour. Likewise the same with someone in the really low weight range - most of the time these guys would be quite active, so if you are not then don't go there. If your idea of a blissful weekend starts and ends with time on the couch watching movies - you probably won't be happy with bike rides all over the countryside for the next 40 years of your existence.

, If their ad says, ""I want someone who enjoys nightclubbing"" and you don't enjoy nightclubbing (even though he's really cute!) don't go there. You won't be able to change his mind or him at all and you'd be setting yourself up for a fall. If his ad says that he's 'keeping options open' and not something like 'waiting for my Princess Right', this generally means that he's not into commitment and doesn't want to settle down at this point in his life.

, If he says that he'd like to meet for 'coffee' one night, this could mean one of two things. First, he loves coffee and can't get enough of it at anytime of the day or night and wants to share this with you. On the other hand (and this is something I've experienced personally) 'Coffee' can translate to SEX. Be honest and upfront and say something like, ""Oh, I love coffee! We can try that new Bistro bar in town"" sets the tone that you've taken notice of what he likes to do but saved yourself embarrassment so as not to misconstrue the word 'coffee'.

, then go for it. If he has stipulated that he prefers small Asian women and you are a curvy redhead with a few extra pounds - don't bother - you'd be setting yourself up for a fall. You cannot change his preference any more than you can be dishonest with yourself about what you like in a man. Be prepared to compromise though, dating is not all about rules and regulations, sometimes what guys put in their profile is negotiable. Sometimes you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you meet THE ONE. Just have fun and above all - be yourself.

Don't settle; however, understand that the saying you can't judge a book by its cover can be very true. If you can't find anyone interesting in the current profiles, understand that new ones appear daily on popular sites.;
, Put up several recent photographs of yourself -- in both indoor and outdoor light, also a variety of full body shots as well as close ups of your face. Do not put the classic ""Myspace angle"" photos or any glamour pictures. If posting a photo online makes you uneasy consider using a private photo sharing service such as www.protectedpix.com. Using the 'teaser image' feature you can modify your photo to give an idea of what you look like without someone being able to actually identify you. You can show your original photo to someone after you screen them and decide that you are interested.

, Don't put all of your focus on online dating. Don't seem so desperate that the internet is your last and only hope to find that someone special. For all you know the right person is out at the library, coffee shop, or buying groceries. You have to be positive and think that way as well. People are not attracted to desperation.

, Check a few times a week to see if anyone new has shown up that may interest you.

, Do not hound the same person over and over, send them a message or two and after that leave them alone if they don't return your contact -- they're probably not interested.

, When writing things about yourself tell people what kind of person you are looking for. Be humorous and upbeat, but be clear about what your interests are and the type of individual you are interested in. If you won't date a smoker, a drinker, someone with children, make that clear (but not rudely) in your profile. Keep in mind that some smokers, drinkers, single parents may still (for whatever reasons) contact you.

, Some of the online dating websites are becoming more sophisticated in the way they match up people, but that does not mean that they cannot make mistakes. Always check someone out for yourself (Google, Dogpile, etc.) before you accept a date from them. Just because an emotionless computer thinks you may be a good match for someone does not mean that you are. Look their profile over and email/call them a few times before making the decision to meet.

, Always have a phone conversation with a match before any initial meeting. Be highly cautious of anyone who does not want to speak on the phone before meeting, or comes up with repeated excuses as to why they cannot meet you. Have no further contact if a match does this.

, Be cautious with the information that you provide a potential match. Do not give specific details about where you live or where you are employed.

, Take note of any discrepancies in the details the person provides you -- it's usually an indication that the person is misleading you.

, Always have the first few meetings and dates in a public place and always let a relative or friend know where you are going and who you are meeting. Never invite someone to your home during an initial meeting. Do not drink heavily and do not allow anyone but the wait staff and yourself near your drink.

, Have a friend or relative call or text you during your initial meeting to see if you're fine.

, Be alert to red flags, such as a person repeatedly canceling meetings, asking for money, or pressuring you for personal information or sex (including nude photos) early in your acquaintanceship. Cut off contact completely if any of these occur.

, Be optimistic and upbeat, but be realistic that even the most accurate profile and photograph does not always correlate to real life chemistry between two people. Sometimes two individuals simply won't click, but sometimes they will. Good luck!

Note any age difference in which you are the older one.,
Look for the following descriptions in their profile:


self employed, a professional (for example, an engineer) working overseas
a widower with a child (or just widowed)
they claim to live near you, in your country, currently away but will be returning soon.

,
Do a photo check.,
Check other photos you receive.,
Note discrepancies that are a dead giveaway.,
Look closely at emails they send you.,
Talk.,
Be suspicious of rapid escalation.,
Watch out for the catch.",How to Spot an Online Dating Scammer," Online dating scammers usually target people older than themselves. In the case of a male scammer, they often target middle aged women in their 50's to 60's. They believe these people to be ideal targets as they are usually richer and more vulnerable.;
,, Save a copy of their profile picture. Use Google image search. Check the results. Are they already marked up as scammers or is the return illegitimate in some way? Report to the dating site giving the evidence, including any website links.

, Look for signs that don't seem to gel with who you understand this person to be. For example, check the background, landscapes and even clocks or calendars. Can you see identifying features that do not match with the picture this person has built up of themselves?

, For example:


They say they have been away, yet their profile shows them online (most likely chatting up some other victim online).
The profile shows geographic inconsistencies, often referencing places that are not in geographic proximity to where they live.

, The scammer will send you an email which is full of inconsistencies, often getting their own name or your name wrong. It will be badly written and repeat itself. Watch for these other signs:


Their command of your language deteriorates with time. They may even start out having no clue about grammar or punctuation.
They make mistakes, in that their ""story"" begins to contradict itself here and there.
They mix pronouns (he/she, him/her).
They mention things that seem entirely unrelated to the profile they've built up of themselves, or that seem too revealing and even unbelievable.

, Phone conversations can often unravel a fake. When you hear this person on the phone, note whether they have a slight accent and use awkward phrases; if their accent does not match their supposed origin, be suspicious. Ask them probing questions and trust your gut instinct about the validity of the replies.


If phoning, beware a cell phone number that does not match the area in which they claim to live. This often means that the person is not in the same country at all. Match the cell phone number and the area code with the state or province they claim to live in.
If you spot a number discrepancy, beware excuses. They may tell you they've just moved or didn't bother to change it when they did because it would be too hard to contact all their friends with a new number.

, If the person suggests that the communication switch to phone calls and texting ASAP, be alarmed. Then, if the phone calls and texting rapidly escalate in expressions of love and passion, and within a matter of 5 to 6 weeks they tell you that they have fallen in love, be very alarmed.


Over-the-top expressions of feelings for you even though you haven't met are a warning sign.

, When they think they have you on their hook, this is when they reel you in. They will tell you they are on their way home to be with you to start a new life together. But then out of the blue they will say they have a financial emergency. They will ask for money to be sent to them immediately to get them out of a fix. If you do not send them money or insist on safeguards in the sending of any, they will pull out the trust card, saying: Where there is no trust, there can be no relationship. Take that as your cue to walk away for good.


Think about why it is that this person has all the time in the world to text or email you but cannot manage to meet you in person. That's a telling sign of the faker.

You want to meet real women online and flirt your way into a meet up? Get on dating sites and use dating apps.Use all of them. If you want to be seducing a woman soon, you need to get on all of the following:


Tinder
Down (aka Bang with Friends)
Pure
OkCupid
eHarmony
Match
Meet Up;
, Yes, real pictures, not pictures of Channing Tatum. Change them up occasionally to attract attention to your profile. Keep them current so your date recognizes you at a glance without disappointment, or you're wasting your time.


Make sure they highlight your best attributes. No x-rated shots, or ridiculous drunken night selfies. Also, nobody cares about your car. You're trying to attract women, not a bunch of dudes from AutoZone.

, Most apps and sites require you to fill in a short bio section to describe yourself. What do you say? Just the truth. If you want to attract women that you'll be attracted to and who will be attracted to you, then it's a good idea to not try to make yourself sound like something that you're not.


Use specific and honest details. What's a regular day like for you? What do you like to do? What do you enjoy? You don't have to make yourself look ""good,"" or sound ""smart"" to attract a woman's attention. You just need to let your personal sense of humor be on display. That'll be easier to keep up anyway.
Look at other profiles for good examples, before you put up much about yourself. Avoid things you see that seem lame, or seem too desperate. try to remember: Lists of travel locations and books you've read can all start to look the same. try to be unique.Don't focus too much on what you are or aren't looking for in a woman because it can rule out both the ones you want and don't want to meet. At the same time, it's good to use words like ""casual"" and ""hang out"" if you're not interested in a big relationship, but are interested in hook-ups.

, This is the fun part. Just cruise around the site for a while and see who catches your eye, and whether or not that woman might be good to get to know for a while. Then you can turn on the charm.


Keep an eye out for good buzz-words. If a woman puts up that she's not interested in a long-term relationship right now, that might be someone to check out if you're not either. Depending on what you're interested in, keep an eye out for someone who has the same interests and goals.
Keep an eye out for obviously bad signs, too. Anyone who says they ""Don't want any drama"" is obviously a drama-creator. Anyone who says they
Most dating apps will filter so that you only see people in your area, so you don't have to worry about traveling or trying to figure out too many logistics. It's a good idea to avoid starting a long-distance relationship online, unless that's what you're looking for.

, try to remember: For every message you send to a woman, she might get 25-100 others. What are you going to say that will catch her attention? What can you say that will stand out from the crowd? Be personal, specific, funny, and keep it light, above all.


Find a specific thing on her profile, or a picture to tease her about. If she has a picture of herself riding a horse in the mountains, write something like, ""That horse looks like it would really do some damage to linoleum floors. I guess they probably hassle you about it when you ride it into saloons and such. Good thing I have a car if you ever want to meet for a drink.""
Write different messages to each person. Copy-pasted messages stand out like turds in punch bowls. Give a woman the courtesy of actually having something to say to her.
Avoid coming off as whitebread, or basic. Don't use phrases like, ""I'm just a regular average guy, pretty laid back and I like having a good time."" So what? Who doesn't? Aim a little higher.
Don't go overboard on compliments because chances are she's so used to hearing them that she wouldn't even notice you.

, People don't like to admit it, but meeting women online is a numbers game. Send out lots of messages, every day, and get to know as many different girls as possible. You have to be willing to put in some hours looking at different profiles, finding girls you'd like to talk to, and actually talking to them. There's no shortcut. You have to do the work.


Don't get fixated on seducing one woman. There's going to be a lot of rejection involved in this. Spread the love around.

, This is an absolute must. If you reach out and send someone a message, it's obvious that you're interested. Saying so out loud will only make you look desperate and needy, or insecure. You want to seem like the opposite of that. You want to seem like a mysterious and magnetic personality that she must get to know. In person.


Lots of guys launch into compliments and really seem to over-do it. Many women will respond to this, but they're not really interested. If you want to actually get with a girl, start an emotional connection and a conversation, not an empty compliment.

, Some studies show that when we feel both positive and negative emotions at the same time, there is a kind of magnetic reaction that happens, which is often attraction.A common tactic that works especially well online is to gently and kindly tease a woman while you're chatting via text, email, or IM, about something.Just be friendly and joking with a woman. Don't be flat-out mean. There's a difference between saying something gently teasing, ""That picture of you on a horse makes me scared you're going to out-drink me and shoot me in the chest with your six gun. But I don't know if you have that in you..."" and saying something like, ""A woman who likes horses. Typical."" That's not funny, or charming.

, Pick something in her profile, or something that you notice about her in a picture and start there. Never start a chat with nothing but, ""hey"" or ""what up."" That doesn't give you any spark. You're going to get nowhere starting a conversation with nothing.If you can't find anything you want to say other than, ""Jeez you're hot and I'd love to hang out,"" lead with a silly or random question to get talking about something more interested: ""I'd like to say something more interesting, but I'm a little stunned by your picture. To get around this, I have to ask: If you had twenty minutes left on earth, what would you do first?""

, Ask questions to get a woman talking, flirting comfortably, and being comfortable with you. Listen to what she says and follow up with witty responses that will keep her interested. You want to make her want to talk to you.


Ask open-ended questions, not closed ones. ""What's up?"" is always going to be, ""Not much."" Instead, say, ""What have you been doing since we talked last?"" or better yet, ask follow-up questions. If she mentions a recent trip, ask, ""What was that like? What was your favorite part? What was the worst thing you ate?"" Give her things to say.
Don't push it, and wait patiently for her messages. If you haven't gotten a response right away, don't write again until you do. If the messages drop dead after you gave her something specifically to respond to, the conversation is dead.

, Guys come off like single-minded hounds way too often on the Internet. If you want to stand out, that's not the way to do it. If you're chatting on a dating site, she knows you're interested.


Sometimes, a little innuendo is fine, but keep it G-rated. If you're describing anything graphic, that's not going to be flirtatious, it's just going to be pornographic. Wouldn't you rather wait for the real thing?
Never, under any circumstances, should your first message involve any kind of sex joke or reference to a sex act, or a reference to what's between your legs. This isn't a funny way to stand out. It's a juvenile joke that only other dudes will think is funny.

, Ideally, you want to be in demand. When she think of you, she should be thinking that she wants more. Often, online chats and conversations will kind of peter out naturally, and you'll both just run out of things to say. Before it gets to that, try to cut it off by saying something like, ""Well, I've got to get going. My cat is hungry and is looking at me sideways. I'm scared for my face.""


It's generally good to wait a bit before you talk again, but if you're really having a good conversation, try to keep it going as long as possible. Instead of transitioning to, ""Well, I better get going,"" transition to, ""Hey, crazy thought. What if we continued this over a drink tomorrow night?""

, Generally, you should have a couple of chats, texts back and forth, or funny conversations on the phone before you try to get a woman to meet you somewhere. It might seem like you're being patient, but it might look to her like, ""Hey, I think you're really pretty, oh haha you're funny to, want to meet me right now??"" If you lead too quickly, it'll be a turn off.


There's no good rule of thumb, because every one and every conversation is different. try to feel out each girl you're talking to and wait until she says something positive to you, then don't be pushy.
Once you've asked, don't bring it up again until she does. You put it out there, so it's unlikely she'll forget that you're interested.

, Women aren't interested in meeting man-boys. If your only interests are Xbox, goofing off online, and watching UFC, those aren't things that girls you hope to hook up with need to know about you. Focus on what you're doing right and how well you're put together, and let a little of the other stuff creep in to show you've got a funny side.


Want to come off like someone who's got it together? Talk about what creative projects you've got going on, but without getting into the nitty gritty.
Come up with a great way to summarize yourself: ""Novelist, explorer of the halfpipe, and body-mod aficionado"" sounds a lot better than, ""Drop out English major with a skateboard and a septum piercing.""

, If you want to go from ""funny online chat guy"" to ""guy who goes home with someone,"" you need to learn how to come off as a mysterious sexual force online. That involves a little bit of dynamic mystery in your chatting skills. Pull back a little and don't reveal too much about yourself.


Don't be too enthusiastic about anything. Don't overdo it with the, ""Hahahahaha ur so funny!!!"" when she makes a joke. Instead, just write, ""Ha"" and keep the conversation moving forward with your own contributions to the fun.

, After you've hooked a woman who enjoys talking to you, it's time to pull the trigger and ask her if she wants to go out. There's no big secret to this, other than doing it specifically instead of vaguely. Don't ask someone if they want to get a drink with you ""sometime,"" say, ""I know this place that does a great happy hour on Fridays. Interested? I'll be there anyway with some friends.""


Keep your first meeting casual. Meet her with some friends so she feels comfortable, or make it a big and fun event that will be pressure free. Good way to do things.

, There's no use in barking up the wrong tree. If something isn't working out, it's much better to stop before you make a mistake. If you don't get a quick response, don't just keep sending messages, or start thinking that you're writing messages in a vacuum. She's getting them. If she's not responding, it's because she doesn't want to. Take it easy, and put your efforts elsewhere.


You never know when a woman might cycle back through her contact list and say, ""Gee, that guy was kind of interesting, maybe I'll send him a message."" Never lash out if you get rejected. It's really easy to post that stuff to Facebook and make you look like a total idiot.

Face-to-face meetings help matchmakers get a sense of their clients’ personalities. Full-service, in-person matchmaking companies are more expensive than customer-driven or algorithmic services.The price for this type of service can range from $5000 to $50,000 and up.
These services typically include pre-date guidance and post-date feedback.
Pick a niche service if you have specific religious, cultural or sexual preferences.;
, Ask how the company started and how long they have been in the business. Also enquire about the company’s Better Business Bureau rating.Additionally, see how the company defines success—is it marriage or relationships that last for a year?

, While matchmakers are not required to have certification, some of them do. Ask the company if their matchmakers are certified or trained. If they are trained, ask about the training process.For example, “What does the training process entail and how long is it?” and “Is there a formal process for clients to submit complaints about matchmakers?”

, If a company will not provide references, then view this as a red flag. High-quality services should be willing to provide you with references from former clients. Contact clients and ask them about their previous experiences with the company.Additionally, see if you can get a reference from a client that is currently using the company’s services.

, This is the first step of the screening process. It is generally a lengthy application that asks detailed questions about your demographics, background, and relationship status. You will also need to provide a photograph.Many high-quality services have a screening process that consists of an online application, a background check, and an in-person interview.

, If your online application is accepted, then the company will schedule an in-person interview with you. The interviewer will ask more in-depth questions about your background, personality, and what you are looking for in a potential mate.The agency may ask you, ""What is your ideal vacation?"" ""How do you typically spend your Saturday morning?"" ""What is your ideal date?"" and ""What qualities do you value most in a person?""
Make sure to answer the interviewer’s questions truthfully so the service can find matches that meet your needs and expectations.

, Matchmaking services typically have a variety of membership packages that you can choose from. Generally, the difference between the packages are the amount of dates offered or the number months the service agrees to work with you, as well as the type of services offered with the package. Once you decide on a package, you will pay a flat fee upfront.For example, you may pay $1,000 for four pre-arranged dates, which may include counseling or guidance services.
If you decide to cancel your membership, you may be able to get a full or partial refund, however, it depends on the service's terms and conditions.

, A good matchmaker will make you feel comfortable and hopeful. They should have a sincere desire to understand your preferences and find the best possible match for you. They should also be forthcoming about the number of potential candidates they currently have. Use the interview to ask the matchmaker questions about their services and personal success, such as:“How long have you been working with the company?”
“What qualities do you bring to matchmaking that help aid in your success?”
“Will you meet potential matches for me on my behalf?”
“How big is your pool of potential candidates?”

, You may be contacted within a week, or it may take longer for the service to find a potential match for you. Once a match is found, you will be notified. Then review the match’s information and agree (or not) to set up a date.Depending on the service, men may be required to contact the woman to set up a date.

, For the first date, choose a meeting place that is casual and comfortable. This will help reduce any anxieties you have about the first date. Make sure to come to agreement about the place and time for the date.Your service may act as the primary liaison and set up the first date for you, i.e., location and meeting time.

, After your first date, contact the agency and provide them with some feedback. Let them know how well the match fit your expectations. Also let them know what you liked or disliked about the process and service.Always alert your service if something has changed in your application so they can adjust accordingly.

, If you are interested in seeing a person for a second time, let your agency know. They will contact the person for you to see if they would like to go on a second date as well. If the person agrees to a second date, the agency may pre-arrange the date for you, or you may be able to contact the person yourself to set the date up.If the date did not go well, let the agency know and they will set up another date with a different person.

Add a Gmail e-mail account to Mail as an IMAP account type.,





Organizing Mailboxes in Gmail.,

Managing messages in ALL MAIL.",How to Use a Gmail Imap Account in Thunderbird or Mac Mail,"
When you set up an IMAP account in Mail, you are actually setting up the ability to synchronize your email between the server (at gmail.com) and on your computer - in fact, on as many computers as you care to set up in this manner. This means that while logged on to the server if you delete a message in a Mailbox that same message will be deleted from the same Mailbox in Mail on your computer in seconds (if your Mail application is open on your computer at the time, or it will be deleted when you next open your Mail application). Or, if you are logged in to a computer and delete a message in a Mailbox in Mail then the same message is deleted in the same Mailbox on the server in seconds. This works no matter which Mailbox in Gmail you are working in.
Any Mailbox that you create in Gmail on the server automatically gets created in Mail on your computer, and vice versa. But keep in mind that on your computer you can create a Mailbox in two different places in Mail. One place is as a child of the account and the other place is as a child of the Local account in Thunderbird or of ON MY MAC in Mac Mail. Mailboxes created in those latter two places are completely independent of your account. If you move a message from a Mailbox to any of your local Mailboxes, it is deleted from the Mailbox in but will still be found in ALL MAIL in .
,







Figure 1 shows the default organization of Mailboxes in Mac Mail for a Gmail IMAP account. The arrows to the left of the Inbox, Sent, Trash, and Junk Mailboxes indicates that more than one email account is associated with those Mailboxes. Ignore them for this purpose. The Sent, Trash, and Junk Mailboxes are actually local to the Mac. The one that really matters for synchronization purposes is the Inbox. Notice that the Gmail section doesn't show an Inbox.






Figure 2 shows the default Mailbox organization in Thunderbird. The Drafts, Templates, Sent, and Trash Mailboxes in Thunderbird are also local to the computer, the Inbox being the only one here that is synchronized with Gmail. Keep in mind that if you start a new message on the computer and save it to the Drafts Mailbox, it is not synchronized to the Gmail server or to other computers. But if you start a new message on the Gmail server and save it to Drafts, it will show up in the Drafts Mailbox under on any computer, but not in the local Drafts Mailbox.






Figure 3 shows the default Mailbox organization in Gmail on the server. What you don't see here is All Mail. That's because it is at the very end of all the Mailboxes I've created, and it's tucked in a Label called ""4 more"" (yours might be different) along with Trash.
Figure 4 shows the rest of the Gmail Mailboxes.
Any Mailbox created for the purpose of organizing your messages will come after these.


,
The All Mail Mailbox in could throw you for a loop. When you delete a message in any Mailbox of Mail, it moves to the Trash Mailbox in Mail, not to the Trash Mailbox in . However, if you delete a message in any of the Gmail Mailboxes, they go to the Trash Mailbox in Gmail. Then, back in Mail, you find that the Trash in has the deleted message because it is one of the synchronized Mailboxes. When you delete the contents of the Trash Mailbox in , it goes to the Trash Mailbox in Mail, and you then have to empty the trash again. So it goes. Now let's say that you deleted a message in All Mail that you hadn't read yet. Look again. It's back in All Mail. To understand what just happened you have to go to the Gmail server and look in All Mail there. You might notice that the message is tagged as still being in the Inbox but also tagged as being in the /Trash. See Figure 5. The deleted message found it's way back in All Mail because it is an archived message.
Not to be too surprising here, but there will be lots of times that you think you removed messages in Mailboxes on the computer and then discover that a lot of the same messages are still in All Mail. Remember, I said that All Mail is an archive of messages. So please don't go ranting that something is dreadfully wrong. If you don't want the archived message in All Mail, delete it, but do so while logged into the Gmail server - not in the computer. Just make sure that you are deleting something that you don't ever want to see again. And remember, after deleting messages from All Mail, you then need to empty the Trash."

If you forward your emails, beware of the spam filter - you cannot turn off the spam filter in the Google Apps account, so take the measures below to avoid losing important emails.",How to Manage Your Google Apps Email Account," If you like your old email setup (e.g. you've already got your folders/labels and email filters set up) you don't have to change. You can just go to ""Settings"" in the Google Apps email account, and set up email forwarding to your old account.;
,


Your new account has an ""untrained"" spam filter, which will be overactive in sending good emails to the spam folder. You can reduce this by these steps:








Import your contacts from your old email account - if an email comes from someone in your existing contacts list, the spam filter is less likely to think it's spam.






In your old account, go to contacts or address book and look for an ""export"" function. If you can, export to a .csv file.
In your new Google Apps account, click contacts, choose ""Import"" and select the file you exported from your old account. This should be complete.
To improve the spam filter, and catch the good emails that still get caught, regularly log into your Google Apps account. Check through the spam folder, select the good emails and click ""Not spam"".

Storing information; it’s better to save information as a document on your computer or in the cloud
Reminding you what needs to be done; rather use a to-do list or calendar for this;
,


Use a ‘follow up’ or ‘respond’ label for things you must do. You should then add these to your diary or ‘to do’ list.
Use ‘awaiting response’ when you’re waiting for someone else
Use ‘urgent’ for things that must be done as soon as possible

Use the Google Inbox app exclusively.",How to Switch from Gmail to Google Inbox," These two concepts are the backbone of the Google Inbox system, and taking a little time to understand how they work will make transitioning from Gmail to Google Inbox much simpler.



Labels are a way to sort your incoming mail automatically by using rules and applying categories to messages. These work very similarly to labels, rules, and filters in Gmail (your old labels and rules are even still here).

Bundles are collections of new messages in your inbox that have the same labels. These bundles are a sort of holding area for your incoming messages, and help keep your inbox from overflowing with individual messages. Opening a bundle will allow you to see all of the new messages you have received with that bundle's label. Bundling is enabled on a label-by-label basis.;
, Google Inbox has several premade labels that it will attempt to sort the bulk of your email into, such as purchase receipts, travel itineraries, social media updates, and more. Each of the premade labels has a unique icon.


Any labels that you had previously created in Gmail will be listed below the premade ones.

,, You'll want to be able to know at a glance what kind of messages the label will contain.

, Select ""From"" to choose the type of rule you want to add.


From - Any email sent from the email address or name you specify will be added to the label.
To - Any email addressed to the email address or name you specify will be added to the label.
Subject - Any subject that matches the subject you enter will be added to the label.
Includes - Any message body that has the keyword(s) you specify will be added to the label.
Excludes - Any message body that doesn't have the keyword(s) you specify will be added to the label.

, You can add multiple rules to one label to really customize the types of messages that get sorted into it. Only emails that meet all of the rules for the label will get sorted into it.

, Any future emails you receive that match all the label rules will be added to that label. Emails that you have already received will not be automatically sorted into the label.

, You can find a list of all your labels in the Google Inbox menu (☰).


All of the labels that are currently bundled, such as your premade bundles like Travel and Finance, will be listed under the system folders (Sent, Spam, etc.).
Labels that are set to skip the inbox entirely are listed next.
Labels that you do not have bundled are listed at the bottom of the menu.

, This is located at the top of the open label.

,


When bundling is enabled, any messages received in that label will be collected together in your inbox. The collection will be labeled with the label's name, and unread messages will be bolded. Expanding the bundle will let you see all of the messages in that bundle that have not yet been marked as Done.
When bundling is disabled, new messages with that label will not be gathered in one place in your inbox, and will appear at the top when they arrive. If bundling is disabled, you can check the ""Skip the inbox"" box and any message with that bundle will automatically be marked as Done (archived).

, By default, bundles are set to appear at the top of the inbox when a new message arrives in that label. You can change this to once a day or once a week.


If you set the interval to daily or weekly, you will not be notified when new messages arrive. Instead, the bundle will appear at the top of your inbox at the designated time if new messages have arrived.
If your label has important messages, you should probably set the bundle to appear as soon as new messages arrive. This will ensure that you receive your important messages immediately.

, You can turn notifications on or off for each bundled label. This can only be done from mobile devices.


If enabled, you will receive a notification whenever the bundle appears back in your inbox.

, The ""Move to"" button looks like three stacked dots.


Google Inbox works best when the majority of your emails are labeled. This allows you to use the bundle settings to keep your inbox clean.

, You can create a new label by selecting ""Create new"" at the bottom of the list.

, This will ensure that all new messages from that sender will be paced in the label as well.

, Marking a message as Done will remove it from your inbox. It can still be found at any time. Doing this for all the messages you no longer need will keep your inbox very clean.

, Swiping a bundle of messages will mark all of the messages in that bundle as Done at once.

, You can click the Checkmark for a bundle to mark every message in the Bundle Done at the same time.

, Messages that have been marked as Done can be found in the Done folder of the Google Inbox menu (☰), or in their specific label's folder.

, Snoozing a message or reminder will allow you to deal with items at a later time, or set an email to appear when you arrive at a location. When an email or reminder reaches its Snooze time, it will reappear at the top of your inbox.


Snoozing an item hides it from your inbox until the set date and time.

, You will be prompted when you want to Snooze the item until.

, You will be prompted when you want to Snooze the item until.

, Want a certain message to appear when you get to work? Need a shopping list to come up when you get to the store? You can use the Snooze function to hide a message until you reach a specific destination. Click here for detailed instructions.


You need to enable location services for Google Inbox on your mobile device before you can set location-based Snoozes.

, If you use your computer to check your email, start visiting inbox.google.com instead of mail.google.com.


At the time of this writing, the Google Chrome browser is the only one supported. Support for more browsers will be available soon.

, If you're using the Google Inbox mobile app, you'll want to turn off any Gmail notifications so you don't get bombarded when receiving new messages.


Android - Open the Gmail app, tap the Menu button and select Settings from the bottom of the menu. Select your Google account and uncheck the Notifications box.
iOS - Open the Settings app and tap Notifications. Find and open the Gmail option. Toggle Notifications off.

, If necessary, hide your old Gmail app or even uninstall it. There are very few things that you can't do in the Google Inbox app that you can in Gmail.

, You will then be redirected back to the home page.

, A menu will pop up and from here you will see the triangle-shaped icon labeled ""Drive"". Click on it and you will be redirected to the ""My Drive"" main screen.

, This creates a new untitled document that you can now edit just as you would on other word processors such as Microsoft Word.

, First, create a running header by clicking on the ""Insert"" option on the top left of the toolbar and select ""Header"" from the drop down menu. Click the box next to the ""Different first page header/footer"" pop up to place a check mark into it. Make sure the blinking cursor is on the left hand side of the page and type ""Running head:"" followed by the title of your paper in all capital letters so it looks like this: ""Running head: TITLE OF YOUR PAPER"".

, Click the ""Insert"" tab on the top left again and hover your cursor over the ""Page number"" option. Select the first choice in the pop up images that appear, with the numbers proceeding in sequence on the top right of the preview pictures of the pages. Clicking that will cause a number 1 to appear right after your title in the header.


This is where it gets a little tricky. Click before the number one to put your blinking cursor before the number one and after the last word of your title. Then press the ""tab"" key and/or spacebar on your keyboard to bring the number one all the way to the right hand side of the page. This step is so tedious because although Microsoft Word has a way to input two separate pieces of information in the header and justify one to the far left and one to the far right, Google Docs does not have a way to do this, thus we manually justify the page number to the right. After you have your running head and title to the left of the header and your page number on the right, exit the header by clicking anywhere else on the page outside of the header field.

, Do this by first clicking on the icon in the toolbar with the centered horizontal lines and the pop up message ""Center (Ctrl+Shift+E)"" when you hover over it with the mouse. Further to the right is the line spacing icon, composed of a vertical arrow pointing up and down and more horizontal lines. Hovering over this icon will prompt a pop up message that says ""Line spacing"". Click this icon, and from the drop down menu that appears, select ""Double"".

, This does not need to be precise.

, ""Title of Your Paper"". Press enter.

, Include first and last name (middle initial is optional). Do NOT include titles (Dr., Mrs., Mr., etc..) or degrees (PhD, Master's, etc..). Press enter.

, Press enter.

, You have made your APA title page via Google Drive! Good luck with the rest of your paper!

There are a variety of keylogger programs available for free or for purchase online, with varying degrees of stealthiness. Be sure to research all of your options carefully. Popular programs include:


Actual Keylogger
Spyrix Free Keylogger
BlackBox Express
KidLogger
NetBull
Lola

, This will require administrator access to the target's computer. On many computers, the password will be ""admin"" or will just be blank.


The process for installing the keylogger varies depending on the program you are using.
Installing a keylogger without the other person knowing is illegal.

, Start the service so that it begins recording keystrokes. The process for this will vary depending on the program you are using. You may have to configure the program to record keys if it has multiple functions.

, The keylogger will likely capture a lot of information. You can filter based on the window that the user is typing in.

, Some keyloggers will send the logs to your email. Others will require you to export them from the computer that the program is running on. Browse through the logs until you find what you suspect to be the target's Gmail password. You may be able to filter by the Gmail login page.


If the keylogger doesn't send you the logs via email, you'll need to access the program on the computer you installed it on to view them.

Safari - Click the Safari menu and select ""Preferences."" Click the ""Passwords"" tab.

, Use the search bar in the password manager to search for ""google"". This is the quickest way to narrow down the list of passwords. Look for the ""accounts.google.com"" entry for the target's Gmail address.

, Select the password and then click the ""Show"" or ""Show Password"" button. You may have to enter the administrator password for the computer before the passwords are displayed.

, Make note of the password as well as the exact Gmail address. Close the password manager when you are done to cover your tracks.

, If the target has not enabled two-factor authentication, then you should be able to access the account. The target will likely be notified that a login has occurred from an unknown browser.

This cookie allows the user to stay logged in, even if they leave Gmail. A packet sniffer can find cookies being transferred over a wireless network. When you find a Gmail cookie, you can open it on your computer and potentially access your target's inbox. You'll need to be connected to the same wireless network as your target.


This method will not work if your target has encryption enabled (https://). This is enabled by default in Gmail, so its usefulness is limited.Using a packet sniffer on a public network to intercept traffic is illegal.

, Wireshark is a free network monitoring utility that you can download from wireshark.org. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Installing Wireshark is a straightforward process. Follow the prompts like you would with most programs.During installation, make sure to install the TShark component. This is essential for grabbing cookies over the wireless network. You will also need to install ""WinPcap.""

, This is a Java program that will will find and intercept cookies being sent across the wireless network. Cookie Cadger doesn't need to be installed. It works the same in every operating system.


You will need to have Java 7 installed in order to use Cookie Cadger. You can download Java from java.com/download. See How to Install Java for more details.

, You will need to be connected to the same wireless network as your target. This means you'll need to be close.

Inform the people you’re living with.,

Store away personal belongings that are not for use.,
Fulfill agreements you said yes to.,
Politely explain any house rules you have.,
Provide for their needs.,
Be as courteous and as accommodating as you can be.",How to Be a Good Airbnb Host," If you’re not the only one living in your house, it’s very important that you let your housemates in on your plans. Ideally, inform them of wanting to put your home up on Airbnb. Barring that, at least tell them ahead of time that due to signing up at Airbnb, you are now expecting guests. This way, when your guests arrive, your family or friends who live with you won’t be caught unprepared or, worse, unwelcoming.;
, A house being a reflection of its owner, keeping it spic and span will leave a great first impression. Make sure that furniture is free of dust, carpets and floors are vacuumed, broken fixtures are fixed, and that anything that looks like trash is junked.

, Take care to move any personal items that you’d really prefer not to be touched or used by your guests to your (restricted) personal area or to a secure location, such as a locked closet or a safe.

, If you agreed to include airport/seaport/train pickups, then by all means be at the terminal when your guests roll in. Pick them up on the agreed-upon date and time. They’ve come a long way and are probably quite weary.

, You may have already discussed this before both parties agreed on the reservation. Nonetheless, explaining your dos and don’ts again in person will allow guests to ask questions and help to avoid misunderstanding.

, Since your guests are paying customers, make sure that their needs are met as promised. Needless to say, toiletries and personal hygiene items should be in adequate supply.


If the reservation includes meals, ask your guests ahead of time if there are particular local dishes they have in mind. While you’re at it, ask them about food allergies, if any. Part of taking care of your guests is making sure you stick to the reservation terms.

, Just give it your best. Not running a hotel doesn’t mean you can’t be a great host. Extending little courtesies to your guests and making them feel at home can be very rewarding for you too.


If your guests act in ways you find rude or overstepping, address these concerns immediately and in private. Always keep your cool, and remember it could very well be nothing more than a cultural thing. Not letting issues fester will make for a great stay both for your guests and for you as a host.

The program will show photos in their respective folders.

,, Here is a brief rundown to help you get started:


The first button, ""Crop"", is pretty obvious. By clicking on it, you can cut out a part of your image. You can choose a manual size, or choose one of the preset ratios. Click ""Apply"" when you are finished cropping.
The second button, ""Straighten"", can fix a slanting horizon. Click on it, and use the grid and slider to rotate the photo until straight. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.
The third button, ""Redeye"", is also pretty self-explanatory. If you click it, Picasa will automatically fix any red eyes on a photo and indicate them with a green square. If the program has missed any eyes, you can drag a box around them with your mouse and the program will fix them. If Picasa boxed anything that is not a red eye, you can click on the box for the program to ignore it. Click ""Apply"" when you are done!
The fourth button, ""I'm Feeling Lucky"" adjusts the lighting and colour of your photo, to what the program thinks is a better shade. This button is handy for fixing hazy and dull photos.
The fifth button, ""Auto Contrast"" heightens the contrast of your photo to a better level.
The sixth button, ""Auto Colour"" improves the colour of your photo and works well on dull photos.
The seventh button, ""Retouch"" can remove dust spots on your photo, which helps a lot if you had dust on your camera lens. Click the ""Retouch"" button and then click on a blemish on the photo, then move the mouse around the spot until it is removed. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.
The eighth button, ""Text"" can add text onto your photograph. Click the button and then click anywhere on the photo to start typing. Use the appearing text box on the left to alter the font, size, colour and transparency of the text. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.
The ninth and last button, ""Fill Light"", can lighten your photo if it is too dark. Move the slider up and down until your photo is perfectly lighted.

, The following explanations clarify the use of the tuning tool:


The ""Fill Light"" slider has the same purpose as the last button on the ""Basic"" editing box. Slide it up and down to lighten your photo. Useful for when you forget to switch on your flash.
The ""Highlights"" slider makes the light colours on your photograph lighter and more obvious. Use it when you want the light parts in your photo to stand out.
The ""Shadows"" slider serves the opposite purpose the ""Highlights"" one. Use it when you want to make the dark parts of your photo darker.
The ""Colour Temperature"" slider changes the ""warmth"" of your photo. Blue is cold and red is warm. Move the slider to the left if you want to turn your photo bluer and move it right if you want to turn your photo redder.
The ""Neutral Colour Picker"" removes colour cast from photos. Click on the eye-dropper icon and then on a neutral black, grey or white area of the photo to adjust the colour.

,


""Sharpen"" sharpens the edges in your photograph. Use this when your photo is slightly fuzzy and out of focus. Click on ""Sharpen"" and then move the ""Amount"" slider until you are happy with the changes. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.
""Sepia"" gives your photo an old-fashioned sepia tone.
""B&W"" turns your photo into an old-fashioned black and white shot.
""Warmify"" turns the 'colour temperature' (mentioned above) in your photo warmer.
""Film grain"" gives your photo an old-fashioned film grain. This button combined with ""Sepia"" or ""B&W"" turns modern photographs into lovely old-looking shots.
""Tint"" washes your photo in a colour of your choice. Click on the button and pick a colour with the eyedropper icon to wash your photo with. Then move the ""Colour Preservation"" slider until you are happy with the results. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.
""Saturation"" heightens your photo's saturation. Click on it and then move the ""Amount"" slider to the desired effect. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.
""Soft focus"" softens the photo focus around a point of your choice. This tool is handy for making a single object in a photo stand out. Click it, and then move the ""Size"" and ""Amount"" sliders until you are happy with the effects. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.
""Glow"" makes your photo glow, especially the lighter coloured areas. Click it, and then move the ""Intensity"" and ""Radius"" sliders until you are happy with the effects. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.
""Filtered B&W"" makes a photo look as though it was taken with a black and white camera and a colour filter. Click it and then pick a colour to use for the filter. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.
""Focal B&W"" turns your entire photo into black and white, except around a single point of your choice. Click it and move the pointer on the photo to the desired point. Then move the ""Size"" and ""Sharpness"" sliders until you are happy with the effect. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.
""Graduated Tint"" tints only the top part of your photo, which makes it useful for editing sky-photos. Click it and then pick a colour to use for the tint. Then move the ""Feather"" and ""Shade"" sliders until you are happy with the effect. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.

Preferably choose a position with a lot of natural light. Hang each piece on a hanger individually.


You may want to iron each piece, but it is not necessary yet – it may be best to just keep moving and update your database later with individual items that really bother you un-ironed.
You may want to position each piece in the same orientation on the hangers for a sleek effect (e.g. the hanger always faces left).;
, Do not use the camera flash (you can adjust the lighting later in Picasa). Try to frame each article so that there is a little empty space around it. Some particular things to watch for include:


For shoes: Find a well-lit patch of clear floor space, preferably with a lot of natural light. Place each pair in a 'V' shape and photograph such that you can see one shoe from the front and one shoe from the side, then proceed as suggested above.
For purses: Hang directly on the door or wall hook, and photograph as suggested above.

You may want to play with the 'Highlights' slider. On the 'Basic Fixes' tab, use the 'Straighten' feature to orient your photo, 'Crop' to cut out as much surrounding distractions, and finally 'Auto Contrast' to bring out the article's coloring. If the article has detailing or texture that is not easily seen in the photo, adjust the 'Fill Light' slider to the right just until you can better make out the article's features.

, Using the 'Tag' tool, to the right (if it is not visible, select 'Tags' under 'View' in the toolbar), add descriptive words for each item. Tag every article with 'wardrobe', so you can more easily distinguish it from the rest of your photos.


Include short tags for colors, fabric, type of article (e.g. 'skirt', 'blouse'), seasons, designer, store, and any terms that you personally use to describe the article (for example, 'first date', 'favorite', 'Mike's wedding').
Most importantly, tag each item with all the contexts in which you'd wear it (for example, 'work', 'casual', 'dressy', 'formal', 'club', 'school').
You can include multiple tags for each category (for example, 'blouse', 'shirt', and 'top'; 'summer' and 'spring'), just make sure to include them each as separate tags. You can add more tags later!
You can also tag your photos with 'needs alteration', 'donate', 'needs repair', or 'needs cleaning', so you know what to grab on your way to the thrift store or the dry cleaner's.

Do they have at least one pleasant picture? Is/Are the picture(s) clear and in focus? Are there red flags in their essays - Do you see signs of anger towards family or previous partners? Are there recent ugly breakups or a history of unsuccessful relationships? If so, be extra cautious and use common sense.;
, On some sites and in some smaller cities, often your friends might know or have even met this person. Get their feedback! If nothing else, it can be fun to trade stories.

Reexamine your photos.,
Change your profile headline.,
Improve your description.,
Enlist the help of a friend.",How to Refine Your Online Dating Profile," If you do not have a photo in your profile, add one; many people skip over profiles without photos. Make sure your photo is of good quality and appealing. Try to avoid photos containing other people, or where a person (especially of the opposite sex) is cropped out, leaving a gap or part of their body - this can look tacky. Also, change your photos once in a while - a new photo might catch the attention of someone who skipped over your profile first time.;
, A new headline could catch someone's attention who never noticed your profile before. Try to write something catchy, not the same old line everyone uses - be creative and stand out.





, Keep it short - many people do not have the time to read long profiles. Give people a short teaser of what you are about, and let them contact you to find out more - give them a conversation starter. Let people know what you are looking for, but be flexible about age, height, looks and other details or you might exclude everyone who views your profile. Try not to sound arrogant in your profile - show people what you have to offer, not what you expect from them.

, Having a friend read your profile is a great way to spot problems you may have missed, and get some constructive criticism on things to add. It is especially helpful if your friend is of the sex you are looking to attract - they will know best what appeals to them and what does not.

Really, women just want to see that you look like a nice, normal, friendly, and approachable guy…they don’t want to date someone who looks like they belong in an insane asylum, you feel us?

, The truth is, like most men, women want to date men who are fit. However, this isn’t always the rule. Really, women just want to see the product before they go and purchase it. If you have a nice body, then a shot of you playing tennis or running on the beach are always good shots.

, So if you have a cute tush and can accentuate it by wearing tight pants, go for it. But just remember, no shots of your privates. Yes, there’s a difference between private shots and butt shots. Most men post private shots and it’s old. But women find “cute butts” – well – cute. But ONLY if they really are cute.

, So go ahead and post some goofy photos of you being a clown (but not too goofy).

Find a site that is reputable. Stay away from the sleazy sites. It would be good to find a site that specializes in your interests such as gay dating, black dating, and even specialized religious sites.;
, If they ask for your credit card, be assured they will charge you after that trial period 'unless' you make sure you cancel prior to that date (see tip below).

, Do not lie about your weight and interests, or show a photo of you when you were much younger. After all, the idea of Internet dating is to actually meet in person eventually.

, No telephone number, no address, no last name. If things go well, you can do this later.

, Create a new email address for yourself to use only for dating sites. Do not give out your personal Internet address.

, With practice, you can tell a lot about the other person from how he responds to questions, and what he says on email.

, Call him, but make sure you use the phone blocker if you use your home phone. If you have a cell phone, use that! If he refuses to give you his phone number, be wary. He may be married or have ulterior motives, but he may be just as wary as you are. Instead of talking on the phone, suggest a meeting in a neutral place. (see below)

, Most of the time, men with web cams want to show themselves naked. This is a great big ""Red Flag"".

, This is a ""Red Flag"".

, Don't be put off if he asks to meet you. Ask him where he would like to meet. Be wary if he suggests meeting at his place or yours. This is another Red Flag; stop communicating with him immediately. Always meet in a public, neutral place, preferably during the day.

, Only after you have gotten to know him well and feel safe around him should you invite him over dinner, etc. Also tell a friend or family member that you are meeting someone for the first time, where you're meeting, and what his name is. Also give them his phone number if you have it.

Bite the bullet and just call them.,
Suggest meeting up.",How to Move from Online Dating to Phone," There is no reason for you to start sharing too much information about yourself in an email. When you meet someone for the first time offline - in a bar, church, party - your conversation would be very general. No secret sharing. No therapy sessions. So use that principle when writing emails to a potential date.;
, Answering emails too quickly will give your potential date the impression that you have nothing else to do. It will also make it easier for the conversation to start turning into countless email banters. On the other hand, answering emails after one week will make the other person lose interest. So be excited when you get a response to your email, but wait a little bit (one or two days) before you click the 'reply' button.

, The only way you can move conversation from email to phone is to offer your date your phone number.

, Someone has to dial the other person's number for this to work. And if you're the one who wants to move away from emails already, call them . Of course, it is courteous to send a brief text SMS asking them if it's a good time - or when is a good time - to call. But when you get the go-ahead, call them.

, It doesn't matter how long the first phone call last. You can play by ear and if you feel that there's some kind of connection, suggest few places to meet for a 'short coffee or drinks'. After all, you don't want to be stuck in endless phone conversations either.

, Yahoo and MSN offer, with a few exceptions, global instant messaging, and usually these services are free.

, Think about whether you are interested in developing your romance into something permanent, and how far you are willing to go if you do.

, Since you are going online looking for romance, chances are you may be looking across cultural boundaries for a certain type of person you wouldn't expect to find at a local grocery store or laundry.

, It is a reality that with so many troops deployed and many more people working far from home for contractors, missions, and other reasons, that even long term married couples rely on online romance to keep the fire burning while they are separated.

, ""Plentyoffish.com"" is a Canadian based website with live chat, photo personals, and global searches that is free to use in all of its formats.

, Remember, these profiles go out into the net for potentially millions of people to look at, so be careful what you put on to begin with. If you post a picture, you may end up standing in a supermarket checkout line beside someone you saw online the previous night, wondering, does he/she recognise me?

, If you are a 5'6"" tall guy, and your profile reads 6'2"", it will be hard to pass off as a typo if you ever meet.

, If you are using these for other communications, set up a new account specifically for these romantic encounters.

"
Avoid flimsy tactics.,
Introduce yourself via email.,
Mention something about his profile.,
Ask for him to contact you.,
Keep it short.,
Instead, give him your name, mention something that caught your eye in his profile, ask him to contact you if he’s interested, and sign off.

,
Send only one email.",How to Pick up Men Online,"


Don’t send him a wink because that really doesn’t tell him anything. And don’t just say “hi” and then expect him to do the rest. You’re online here; you need to do something significant. Send him an email. Make your move like a grown up.;
,


Chances are, he hasn’t yet seen your profile, so this is the first impression you’ll be making on him. Mention your name and mention what caught your eye about his profile. Give him a little insight into who you are.

,


Take note of what he has written in his profile and mention something about it in your email. Is he a meat lover? Does he go hiking for fun? Is he a single dad? Mentioning something personal demonstrates that you’re not just sending out a generic email by the boatload to myriad men.

,


Let him know that not only are you interested in him, but you want to hear back from him and you would potentially like to engage in a conversation at some point. The point is to let him know that you want him to take action as well, now that you have made the first move.

,


No one likes to read novellas online, so keep your email short, simple and concise. There’s no need to fill it up with useless banter because the last thing you want him to think is that you’re a chatter bug.

,,


Once you have written to him, do not write to him again until he writes to you. If he doesn’t write to you, then he’s not interested, move on. And yes, he did get your email; don’t start creating drama. He’s not interested, move on.

Choose an online dating site.,
Note that the above points are domain names to niche online sites, which have the .com missing per WikiHow linking policy.

,
Start building your profile.",How to Meet Girls Online1," If you're looking to date around, an online dating site is a safer bet than regular social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. Here are a few you can consider:


Free sites: PlentyofFish, OkCupid Tastebuds.fm (based on taste in music), PassionsNetwork, DateHookup, Mamba (Russian-based).
Paid sites: Match.com, eHarmony, True.com, Lavalife, Lovestruck (UK, Hong Kong and Singapore), Zoosk, Meetic.
If finding a partner who shares your religion is important to you, consider:

Christians: ChristianMingle, ChristianCafe, RainbowChristians (LGBT)
Catholics: CatholicMatch
Jews: JDate, SawYouAtSinai
Mormons: LDSSingles, MormonDating, LDSplanet
Muslims: Muslima, ShaadiConnections
Buddhists: BuddhistConnect
Seventh-day Adventists: Adventist Singles Connection
Pagans: AonghusOg
Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains and others: ShaadiConnections.
Atheists: FreeThinkerMatch

;
,, This is probably the most important step in the whole process. Your profile is your first impression in the online dating world, and it can make or break whether potential partners are interested in you. Consider these areas:


Your username. Consider basing it in your initials, favorite number, or favorite hobby. Avoid using words like ""hot,"" ""sexy,"" ""daddy,"" or any sexualized descriptor in your username — most women will read it as creepy.
Choose a good profile picture. Your profile picture should follow three rules: it should be recent, provide a good look at your face, and make you seem approachable. If you don't currently have a photo that fits this description, take a new one! Bring along a camera next time you go to a social event, and ask a friend to take a quick snap of you.

Avoid professional headshots. They're too stilted for an online dating site, and you'll look like you're trying too hard.


Your bio. Most websites will provide a short bio or ""about me"" section for you to fill in. Don't write a novel, but do provide enough information that potential partners will feel like they're gaining a sense of who you are. You can discuss your hobbies, your goals, what you look for in a relationship, any children you have, or whatever else defines you as a person.

Resist the urge to vent about your previous relationship. ""Recently divorced from a lying, cheating harlot"" reads as ""bitter and angry"" instead of ""dateable and balanced.""


Your interests. Some sites will have a separate area for you to list interests or hobbies. Sports, musical genres or groups, crafts, historical periods, movie genres, types of food, travel destinations, and books are all appropriate topics for this part of your profile.
Who you're interested in meeting. Try not to be too restrictive on these parameters. You never know — your soulmate might only be a year or two older than the top age you specify. Keep your ranges broad, and remember that you're not obligated to date everyone who contacts you.

If you're asked to describe in writing the type of girl you'd like to meet, this is the place to knock it out of the park. Don't say ""I just want someone to talk to"" — no girl wants to be ""just someone to talk to"" when another man will call her a princess or the light of his life. Talk up your future partner in the best terms you can muster. For instance, you might try something like ""I'm looking for the woman of my dreams, who will share my passion for cooking, cycling and honesty, and who will allow me to treat her like the queen she is.""


Your contact settings. Some sites allow you to pick and choose who can see your profile or contact you. If you want to get a lot of responses, make sure it's easy for people to message or email you.

Be a gentleman.,
Stand out.,
Know how to keep a conversation rolling.,
Always leave her wanting more.,
Express gratitude.,
Handle rejection with grace.,
Don't push a date too soon.,
Keep your head up.",How to Meet Girls Online2," If your mother taught you manners, now is the time to break them out. (If not, that's why you're here!) Being polite and kind to everyone you interact with communicates that you're a quality person, online and off, who's worthy of respect and attention. Pay particular attention to these points:


Use correct grammar and spelling. Capitalize proper nouns and the beginning of sentences, and run your message through spell check first if you're unsure. (Most word processors or email clients now have spell check if your browser does not.)
Make a polite introduction. If someone messages you, note that you were delighted to receive their message and give out a little more information about yourself. If you message someone, tell her more about yourself and express that you'd love to get to know her.
Keep it elegant. Remember, if she wanted to meet a slouchy, rude, abrupt barfly, she would have gone to the bar. Instead, she came to the Internet to meet guys like you, so try to step it up a bit. Don't ask what she's wearing or what her figure is like, don't push for pictures right away, and don't ask for highly personal specifics at first (such as where she works or her full name). Instead, focus on her personal interests, her goals, and anything you share in common.

, Most women who use online dating sites get a lot of messages. If you decide to send a lady something, try to make it compelling and different from the rest of what she sees. Ask her a question about her profile, make a tasteful joke, or just be bold and say something like ""You're gorgeous, and you seem fascinating. I'd love nothing more than getting to know you.""

, So you've gotten a nice girl to notice you — now what? How you manage the conversation will determine where the connection goes, but it's easier than you might think. Here's how to continue interacting with her:


Let her talk about herself. Keep in mind that most people are comfortable talking about themselves, because it's a topic they know well. Nervousness might tempt you to keep the conversation focused on yourself, but resist. A big part of being a good conversationalist is being a good listener.
Ask her questions that are thought-provoking, but not too personal. Asking your potential ladylove what she does for fun on the weekends is perfectly fine; asking her if she's divorced or had a hysterectomy is not. Though you might learn this information later, now is not the time. Keep your questions focused on things like what she does to relax, where she's from, where she went to school, what kind of entertainment (books, music, movies, television) she likes, whether she's an animal-lover, etc.
Follow that old adage and steer clear of sex, politics, money and religion. (The obvious exception to this is discussing religion if you're using a religious dating site.) There's a reason why these are forbidden topics when you're first getting to know someone.

, Bow out of the chat session before it gets too stale, or don't be too quick to return her emails. Lowering supply increases demand, and she'll be more interested if you don't immediately give everything away. Be interested, but restrained. (That is, don't send her multiple emails per day at first, or constantly ping her on chat.) Let her come to you a little bit.

, Every so often, let the women you're talking to know how much you appreciate their attention. It doesn't have to be cheesy — something as simple as ""I've really enjoyed getting to know you so far"" or ""Thanks for responding to my message"" will suffice.


If you go on a date with someone you met online, take this a step further. Send her a tasteful, simple bouquet (that is, not two-dozen blood-red roses) the next day with a small note saying that you enjoyed her company. It'll get more mileage than you might think.

, If it doesn't work out, don't get bitter. Instead, say farewell like a gentleman and wish her all the best. Your polite send-off might cause her to circle back later, at which point you can evaluate if you're still interested.


For example, you could say ""I'm sorry we didn't connect, but I wish you all the best"" or ""Good luck finding who you're looking for, and let me know if you ever change your mind.""

, A woman will automatically read you as creepy and only after her body if you start angling for a date too early. Instead, try to be patient and enjoy this period of getting to know her spirit and mind. If things work out, you'll have plenty of time later to bask in her physical presence.


Allow her to let you know when she's ready to meet. You can throw out a no-pressure signal like, ""Just so you know, I'd be thrilled to take you on a date whenever you're ready, but I'm willing to wait. When the time is right for you, let me know.""

, You might encounter a lot of rejection online, as everyone does in the real world. Don't let it get you down, though. The right girl for you is out there somewhere, and maybe you're meant to appreciate her more after getting turned down by the wrong girl(s). Stay positive!

"
"
Decide exactly what kind of people you're looking to meet in order find the relevant websites and applications.,
Consider how much information you're willing to share.,
Consider the level of intimacy you're looking to have with the people you meet online.,
Carefully decide how you can put your best foot forward.,
Keep your profile honest.,
Complete your profile in its entirety.,
Familiarize yourself with the social etiquette of the website or application.,
Engage with the online community!,
Stay safe, and always proceed with caution.,
Respectfully ask if the other person wants to meet up in real life.,
Show up before your arranged meeting time, and groom yourself well.",How to Meet Someone Online," Since most of the relevant websites and online applications will cater to different types of meet-ups, it's important to know from the get-go who you're looking to meet. For example, while eHarmony and Tinder are both great for meeting potential romantic partners, eHarmony is often frequented by individuals interested in serious, monogamous relationships, and Tinder is mostly populated by individuals interested in hook-ups.;
, Websites greatly differ in the amount of information they ask of you and the publicity of that information. Online forums for shared interests, such as GradCafe or Heaven Games, are often open to the entire internet, but demand little information of you. Some social profile sites, such as Facebook, demand a lot of personal information, but then permit you to restrict your privacy as far as you desire.

, Websites also greatly differ in the amount of intimacy their participants expect to share. Online dating websites and applications are often designed with the ultimate aim of meeting people in person. Specialized forums, on the other hand, are designed to facilitate interactions with many different people for the purpose of sharing information, and are often unlikely to lead to either personal relationships or meet-ups in real life.


Note that websites and applications that do not select or filter for your specific location make it harder to meet any of your online conversants in person. Practically, your fellow wine-lover a continent apart will not be able to fly in to grab a drink with you.

, What people see of you on the Internet will determine how you will be perceived--there are no second impressions in the online world. If you're posting a picture of your face for a dating site, choose a flattering image taken with a quality camera. If you're writing a short description of yourself on a forum, choose to highlight your most exciting and unique interests. Write in complete sentences and and with proper spelling. Keep everything short and to the point; people often spend little time composing their judgment of you.


What your ""best foot"" is depends on the online venue. Before creating your real profile, it can help to create a blank profile to browse a site--this way you can see what kinds of profiles are expected of users.

, While it is important to maintain whatever level of privacy you feel is appropriate, it is also important to be truthful in whatever information you do put out on the Internet. If you ever intend to meet your online conversants in person, you want to ensure that they're interested in meeting the real you. Additionally, staying truthful is an important element in building trust in an online world often considered dangerous and unsafe.

, Filling out your entire online profile is useful in getting others to engage with and respond to you. It makes you seem invested in the website or application, it makes you appear more trustworthy, and it makes you seem more interesting and worth talking to.

, Each website and application entails different social expectations, some of which may be unmentioned. Browse the Internet to determine what forms these expectations can take. It is often considered common courtesy, for example, to message a distant acquaintance on Facebook with a brief greeting before adding them as a friend. If a website or application does list any social expectations, of course, it is good practice to follow them. Many online forums, including the more updated and newfangled Reddit, will list their rules of engagement. Breaking these rules can lead to social exclusion and, at worst, banishment from the site or application.


Note that online forums will often contain different messaging boards with their own unique sets of rules--don't presume that one subforum's rules will necessarily apply to another subforum. For example, Reddit's messaging board ""askphilosophy"" permits you to post open-ended questions, but its messaging board ""philosophy"" only permits you to post questions that are followed by some sort of argument or position.

, Meeting people online can be incredibly intimidating, but at some point the only way to succeed is simply by going forth and actually engaging people! Remember that the relative anonymity of the Internet means that you'll be able to retreat from uncomfortable situations at any time, which is helpful to remember if you end up needing to escape an awkward interaction. On the other hand, this same anonymity is what enables certain individuals to act more rashly or harshly than they otherwise would, and so it is important to disengage with these individuals and realize that their opinions have no bearing on the real, offline you.

, The anonymity of the Internet also means that you can never quite be assured of who you are dealing with. Never give out more personal information than you are comfortable giving out. Never agree to go anywhere or do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Trust your gut feeling about a situation.


If you ever feel threatened, reach out out to the moderators of the website or application or find the link to report the individual in question. If you need additional support, you can contact a cyberbullying hotline managed by people who understand your situation.

, You may never have any intention of meeting your online conversants offline, but if you do, it's important to ask them appropriately and respectfully. Don't ask any information of them you wouldn't like to provide yourself. Offer a safe, public space for meeting up (for both your protection and theirs!).


Choose a venue that gives you both the chance to converse as long as you desire with the possibility of leaving at any time. Going for a movie would be a bad choice, for example, because it is unacceptable to talk during a film. Dinner makes for a bad first meet-up as well, since it can be awkward to leave a meal before finishing if you or your conversant is feeling uncomfortable.
If the website or application does not normally lead to real-world meet-ups, as with many online forums dedicated to shared interests, proceed with an extra level of care. Done offhandedly and with little thought, your request can seem intimidating or suspicious.

, Meeting online conversants offline is not all that different from meeting anyone else in the real world. You can't impress someone if you aren't trying to impress them. Treat the other like you would a friend you hadn't seen in years: with warmth, interest, and a respectful degree of personal space and distance. Keep in mind, however, that you are mutually strangers to one another, and that you both know very little still about the other--it takes time to build intimacy, and online intimacy is worlds apart from offline intimacy!

Find your snoozed email and reminders if needed.",How to Snooze an Email or Reminder in Google Inbox," Generally, you'll probably snooze emails from your inbox, but if you want to, you can find an email in your ""done"" folder or under any of your labels and snooze from there, too.;
, There are a few ways to do this:



From your inbox in the app: You can swipe left to snooze it right from your inbox or email folder. As you swipe, you'll see an orange background appear, with a clock on it.

From your inbox on desktop: If you're using the desktop version of Inbox, you can just hover over the email snippet to find the Snooze clock. You can select it straight from there, rather than opening the email up.

From the email itself: If you want to open up the email first, go for it. Then click the clock at the top of the email. You'll find it near the right-hand side, between the pin and the ""done"" checkmark.

, You can select a preset option or customize your own:



Later today, Tomorrow, and Next week are preset options; next to each one, you'll see the exact time and day when Inbox will return the email or reminder to your inbox and notify you. You can also select the Someday option; this will keep the email or reminder in your Snoozed list, towards the bottom, until you manually move it or change the time setting.

Pick a date & time lets you select an exact time. Hit the option and then fill in the date and time you want. Make sure you click Save when you're done.

Pick place lets you select an actual location for the snoozed email or reminder to resurface. You can enter an address (the app will make suggestions as you type, for quicker selection), and Google will push the message back into your inbox when you're there. This comes in very handy if you want a reminder to buy milk next time you're at the store! If you're entering a new location/address, make sure you click Save when you're done.

If you want to save an address to use it again later, hit the Name this place toggle and enter a name.



Last will select the last snooze option that you used, in case you want to use it again.

, When the snooze time is up, or you've reached the chosen location, the email or reminder will pop back into your inbox, with a notification, just like a new message. Just in time!

, If you need to make any changes to your settings or want to unsnooze an email early, hit the main Google Inbox menu in the top left corner (☰). From the left-hand menu, select Snoozed. This will show all your currently snoozed email, organized by time and location of when they're due to ""resurface"".


To adjust a set snooze time/place, repeat the process above. Either swipe left on the email/reminder or click the clock and you can set a new snooze setting.
If you want to turn off snoozing for an email/reminder altogether, rather than adjust it, just hit the ""done"" checkmark on the email, or swipe it right, to move it to your Done folder. Or you can hit the pin icon to pin it back to your inbox immediately.

Labels are Google Inbox's way of organizing your incoming email messages. You can apply labels to messages according to the category of your choice, such as ""Family"", ""Work"", or any other category you'd like. You can configure labels so that the right incoming messages are sent to the right label automatically.
A bundle is a collection of new messages in your inbox that share the same label. Bundles act as holding places for the new messages in your inbox, preventing your inbox from filling up with individual messages. Bundling is enabled on a label-by-label basis.;
, Google Inbox will create a few labels which it will attempt to automatically sort a lot of your email into. Any labels you've previously created in Gmail will be listed below the pre-made ones.

, This will allow you to add a category to sort new messages into.

, Enter a name for the label that is descriptive enough for you to know at a glance what types of messages it will contain.

, When you receive an email that meets any of the rules you create, it will be sorted into that label. Tap ""From"" to choose the type of rule.


From - Any email sent from the email address or name you specify will be added to the label.
To - Any email addressed to the email address or name you specify will be added to the label.
Subject - Any subject that matches the subject you enter will be added to the label.
Includes - Any message body that has the keyword(s) you specify will be added to the label.
Excludes - Any message body that doesn't have the keyword(s) you specify will be added to the label.

, You can add multiple rules to each label so that you get exactly the emails you want. Tap ""And..."" when creating rules to add more. Only emails that meet all of the rules will be included in the label.

, Any future emails that match your rules will be added to the label. Your label rules will not automatically add emails that you had already received before creating the label.

, When creating a new label, it will automatically be set to ""bundle"" together new messages in that label in your inbox. You can verify this by looking at the ""Bundle messages in inbox"" slider.


When bundling is turned on for a label, any messages received in that label will be collected together in your inbox. The collection will be labeled with the label's name, and unread messages will be bolded. Expanding the bundle will let you see all of the messages in that bundle that have not yet been marked as Done.

, By default, the bundle will appear at the top of your inbox whenever a new message with that label arrives. If you don't need to check new messages in that label immediately (marketing messages, automated statements, etc.), you can set the bundle to only appear once a day or once a week.


If the bundles is set to appear once a day or once a week, it will not appear as soon as a new email arrives. The bundle will not appear if no new messages were received.
Labels with important and time-sensitive emails should have their bundles set to appear as soon as new messages are received.

, When notifications are turned on, you will receive a notification on your mobile device whenever the bundle appears in your inbox.


If the bundle is set to appear whenever you receive a new message, you will receive a notification when you receive the message. If the bundle is set to appear once daily or weekly and notifications are turned on, you will receive a notification at the time the bundle appears back in your inbox.
You can only change notification settings from your mobile device.

, Your bundled label will appear in your inbox based on the ""Show bundle"" settings you set earlier. Tapping a bundle in your inbox will expand it and show all of the messages it contains.


You can view all of the messages in a label, and not just the ones bundled in your inbox, by opening the Google Inbox menu and selecting the label from the list.

, If you are finished with all of the messages that are currently in a bundle, you can mark the entire bundle as Done so that all of the messages are removed from the inbox at once.


If you are using the mobile app, swipe the bundle to the right in your inbox.
If you are using the website, click the Checkmark button that appears when you hover over a bundle in your inbox.

Weight - If you are carrying it around, this is information you will want to know

Lens Mount - There are various types of lens and while most cameras will use the same mount for their make of camera, some don't. It is good information to have.

, Here you see that it had a steady decline until recently?? Nikon have a big sale??

,, You might want to do this to see how they compare with each other. For the most part, digital cameras, on Flickr, seemed to decline a bit. At least 2 of the Nikons. The D800 was all over the place and the Canon did fairly well but has a similar pattern as the 2 Nikons. Maybe, it's the iPhone?

Avoid using colors.,

Avoid using the phrase 'A/S/L' or its variations.,
If you want to PM someone, that is chat privately, like in an IM, ask first.",How to Use Proper Chat Room Etiquette,";
, Simply asking for help, saying you need help, or telling the room you have a question will not turn attention towards you. People are not mind readers, and they cannot help you unless you ask for it. Be specific in what you are looking for, and provide all relevant details to your question.

, This is important in any situation, but even more so in a chat room, because only text is seen, and you can not see facial expressions or hear tones of voice.

, Patience is a virtue.

,, mIRC users will be able to see them, but the more hardcore irc users will see nothing but garbage. Often, IRC channels have a mode that will prevent your message from being displayed if it contains color codes.

, It is hard on the eyes to read and considered rude. It is the Internet equivalent to shouting. If you want to call attention to a particular word or phrase, Do so in the same manner that you would in conversation. Just ask, and see who answers.

, ASL is the common greeting and asking for a persons age/sex/location. Considered rude and unnecessary in most chat rooms, often you will give the impression that you are either ignorant or have no real reason to be there. If you want to know something about a person, stick around a while and find out. People are more willing to reveal such personal details about themselves once they get to know you and feel more comfortable around you. You wouldn't instantly walk up to a person in a bar and ask them for their age, or where they live, so don't do it in chat. Or, read their profile.

, It is an invasion of privacy to assume that you can open an instant message window with someone you do not know.

Keep it classy.,
Take your chat elsewhere.",How to Meet and Chat With Girls on Omegle1," Omegle allows you to search for other chatters with similar interests. Enter in some interests that appeal to girls in order to increase your chances of being paired with a female.


Examples include popular music groups and singers, female-centric hobbies, and television shows and movies with a primarily-female audience.;
, It can be tough to get a conversation with a stranger going, so be prepared with a few lines you can start off any conversation with. Ask her how her day is going, if she's seen such-and-such movie/band/show, if she's ever traveled, etc.See this guide for more details and tips on breaking the ice in a conversation.

, If you start off the conversation asking if the other person is female, you're bound to drive most people away. Let the conversation happen a bit, and you'll likely be able to figure out the truth after a little while.


If you are doing a video chat, make sure that the other person is real. It is fairly easy to fake a video using a recording, so ensure that the person is actually talking to you live.

, When you first start chatting with someone, keep the topic of conversation light and easy. Ask her about the place she lives, what she’s into, what she’s studying at school, her hobbies, etc.

, You’ll be able to keep her attention a lot longer if you two have something in common. If she brings up something you’re interested in, be sure to let her know!

, It can be tempting to brag and expand the truth when chatting online, but you’ll get a lot farther if you stay humble. Avoid boasting, and try not to talk about yourself too much.

, Humor is a great way to break the ice, but you have to be careful with it. It can be hard to express inflection and subtlety when typing, which can cause a joke to totally lose its meaning. Avoid offensive jokes.


Try telling a funny story about something that happened to you. It not only paints you as someone who's humble and able to laugh at themselves, but it can also do wonders for breaking the ice. She may have a similar story!

, Avoid being rude or crass. Nothing will end a conversation faster than you saying something lewd or inappropriate. Always be a gentleman, and judge the conversation before taking that leap.


Don't get angry is she doesn't want to continue the conversation. Dust yourself off and find a new chat partner. Don't take out your frustrations on her.

, If the two of you are hitting it off, it may be time to exchange contact information for a better chat program. This will ensure that you can chat with each other at leisure. Popular programs include Skype and AIM. Avoid using any service that includes your real name, such as Facebook, until you've gotten to know each other better.

Don’t give out personal information.,
Don’t meet in person.,

Don't bully the other person.",How to Meet and Chat With Girls on Omegle2," Omegle is a chat with a stranger. Even if you feel like you know the other person, they are still a complete stranger to you. There is also a very good chance that the other person is lying about who they are. Staying safe online is very important, especially when interacting with strangers.

, Avoid setting up any real-life meetings unless you have been chatting for a while through other means. Even then, make sure the meeting place is safe and that both of your feel totally comfortable with the idea.

, If you’re talking to a minor, you can get into a lot of trouble, especially if the talk turns sexual. Anyone over the age of 13 can use Omegle, so exercise caution and common sense when chatting.

, Cyberbullying is a serious issue, and there can be a tendency to be harsh because you are anonymous. Remember that the person on the other end is a real person, with feelings just like you. Bullying can cause significant emotional damage, and should be avoided at all costs. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything."

Try to talk every day for at least an hour or longer.,
Avoid distraction.,
Use programs that enable you to talk to them, such as the voice conversation feature of MSN or Skype or Facebook.,
Enforce the sense of closeness by asking him to play music for you over Voice Conversation, or using Voice Clips.,
To keep the spice in the relationship, send each other random playful emails at unusual or unexpected times of the day.,Remember important events, such as a test they've been stressing about, and email them a good luck card (plenty of websites allow you to do so for free)

,
Play games together online.,
Consider making a joint email account if you don't want anyone else to accidentally read an email your significant other sends you or vice versa.,
Play the Anywhere Anytime Anyhow game, which works great if you both have Blackberries (which allow instant email updates) where one person emails the other person a task and no matter what the person's doing, they have to complete the task (make the tasks fun!),
Be romantic and send the other person random gifts, which can work even if the couple lives in different countries by checking out websites that delivers flowers/teddies in their country and placing an order online.

,
Use MSN to your advantage or Facebook.,
Be involved in the other person's life.,
Having a fight online is probably one of the worst things because its so easy to cut someone out if Internet is the only connection between you two.,
Limit joking/sarcasm to phone conversations.,
Try each time you guys talk to make it interesting, don't make it to look like a boring chat, or she/he will lose interest in you!",How to Maintain an Online Relationship," Take out time to be online, and work around your schedules to have an uninterrupted hour together everyday. If this is not possible, try to get in touch through short email messages or SMS.;
, When you're talking to your significant other, talk to them exclusively, even if it's just for a little bit. It's like the online equivalent of a date or talking on the phone, and if you can give them your undivided attention then, why not online as well?

, MSN and Emails are good, but nothing beats talking to someone.

, If you both like, you could sing favorite songs together over VC, and take turns to play music for each other.

, There's nothing more pleasant than coming home after a long day and finding an unexpected sweet email waiting for you.

,, MSN offers some good online games, and several PC games can be played with a partner, such as Audi or games at Facebook like Tetris. This once again gives a feeling of closeness despite not being physically together.

, Make it something to do with you both, such as your names or birthdays or even favorite songs/bands, and send emails from your account to that account for them to read.

, or Use Facebook chat box.

,, For MSN users, let your display pictures be pictures of the two of you, and sync your MSN nicks (such as both use a line from a song you both like, or have your personal message as a countdown for when you see them next).

, Sometimes having an online relationship can really work for you in the sense that you have things written down (in emails or conversations) and they make good reference to go over in case you're bad with names or can't keep incidents straight in you head, or simply want to double check something they said. Ask them specific questions which show that you're involved in their life.

, Also it's hard to tell the tone from a bunch of words written on a page. Always, always, always take a step back, calm down before hastily replying and back off if you need to. Sometimes you may not mean something harsh, but the other person won't realize that and get hurt.

, Sometimes people get mixed messages from being unable to tell the tone, and don't understand if it was said in a jocular manner or if the other person meant it.

, Usually, when you run out of ideas, or if you do the other should come up with other chat ideas, remember that running out of things to say will sooner or later go to a breakup!

You can change your screen name and headline any time.,
OK, now on to the essays.,
Don’t be afraid to get a second opinion about your profile from a friend or two.",How to Improve Your Online Dating Profile,"


Do the photos best represent you? Do you even have photos up? It’s important to post pictures since most members will only look at profiles with photos. It’s also important to upload your best quality photos. Otherwise, you’re taking a gamble with potential hook-ups who may pass on you solely based on a bad picture. If you’ve had the same photos up for awhile, upload new ones. Include appealing photos that show a variety of sides: playful, sexy, flirtatious, seductive etc. Don’t upload photos of you standing next to your sports car or swarmed around half naked girls. Women consider these type of photos extremely tacky. Another great way to catch someone’s eye is to periodically rotate the order of your photos. Active members will often notice.;
, A new handle and headline could help spark interest in your profile. Do you have a catchy headline or is it blah?

, Are your essays brief or long? Do you come across as confident or arrogant? Do you suggest in your essays that you’re open to meeting a variety of people or are you being picky? Most online daters don’t have the time to read long essays, and the majority is also turned off by arrogance. Another reason you might not be getting results is because your requirements are too rigid. The more flexible you are with looks, age, height, weight and location, the better your chances of getting responses. Another indication that it’s time to redo your essays is if you’re not getting the kind of responses you want. Remember to be as specific as you can about what you’re looking for.

, Have your buddies look it over and ask for their honest opinions. After all, who knows you better than your friends? They might be able to spot things in your profile that you wouldn’t have noticed or realized. An even better idea is to have a female friend take a look at it, since they’re the sex you’re trying to appeal to.

If you are using an older version of Windows, try downloading version 6.35 instead.;
, Once the file is downloaded, open it and install mIRC by following the easy steps on the installation wizard. The installation process usually does not take longer than a few minutes.


Select the ""Full"" installation type if you have not downloaded mIRC before.

, When the installation is complete, check the boxes next to ""Start mIRC"" and ""mIRC Help."" Having the help file open might come in handy during your first session, in case you get stuck trying to do something that is not explained in this guide.

, One of the windows that opens will be called ""About mIRC"" and will ask you to register or continue. mIRC is free to use for 30 days, after which you will need to pay a one-time fee of $20 to register the software. For now, just click Continue to try it out. Follow the instructions in the next section to get started chatting.

, Each time you open mIRC and click past the screen asking you to register, you'll be taken to a screen that asks for your information. Type in the name you would like other people to see in the ""Nickname"" box, as well as an ""Alternative"" name that will be used in case someone is already using your nickname when you join a chat channel. In older versions, the ""Full Name"" and ""Email Address"" are also required, although almost no one uses their real information.In version 7.36, these fields do not appear to be mandatory.

, Click Connect and you'll be taken to a list of Chat channels. Select one of them and click Join to be taken to that channel. You could also type the name of a channel into the text field and click the Join button to the right of that field.


If you get an error message when trying to join a chat channel, see the troubleshooting section below.
If you accidentally closed this window, you can join a channel by using the Commands menu at the top of the screen.

, First, make sure you are connected to the same network as the people you're trying to chat with. Open the options menu by pressing Alt O on the keyboard, then select a server in the same network as your friends. Each network appears as a folder with a name like ""Usenet"" or ""DALnet,"" and has a list of servers underneath it. Select any server in the network your friends are using, then click OK. Now you can join the chat channel as described above.

, Type in the text field at the bottom of the chat window, and hit ""enter"" or ""return"" on your keyboard to submit your chat message.

, The list of names on the right side of a chat window tell you everyone who is currently in the channel. Double click one of the names to open a private chat between just the two of you.


You can also right-click a user name to select from a list of options, including starting a private chat (""Query"") or looking at the user's profile (""Info"").

, To join another channel, click Commands at the top of the MIRC window, and select Join channel. Type in the name of the channel you wish to join, and click OK to open a new chat window.


Alternatively, return to the main mIRC window and type in ""/join"" followed by the name of your channel. Include the # symbol at the beginning of your channel name.

, mIRC comes with a list of popular channels, which you can view by clicking Tools → Channels List or by pressing Alt L. Choose a network from the drop-down menu under ""File,"" then click Get List. Once this list has loaded, you can return to the same screen and search for different topics in that network using the ""Text"" field.

, Many online communities have their own IRC chat, and will list the network and channel name on their forum or website. You can also search through large databases of channel names at sites such as Netsplit and SearchIRC.

, In the main mIRC screen, simply type in ""/join #"" followed by the name of a channel you wish to create, such as ""/join #wikihow"". If the channel doesn't already exist in your network, it will be created.


You can also use commands to make your channel private and invite select users to join you.

, If you type in anything beginning with a ""/"" in mIRC chat, the program will interpret it as a command instead of normal text. You've already learned about /join, but try exploring other options as well, or just learn a few useful ones:/invite Jack #wikihow will send a message to the user Jack asking him to visit channel #wikihow.

/me dances for joy will print the message ""(your nickname) dances for joy,"" without the usual colon (:) that separates your name from the chat message.

/ignore spammer will block you from seeing all messages from anyone with the nickname ""spammer.""

/help followed by the name of any command (such as /help ignore) will tell you more about how to use the command.

, If you can't connect to any channels, click the Tools menu at the top of the screen and select Options. Alternatively, use the keyboard command Alt O. Once the window is open, follow the instructions below to solve your issue.

, According to mIRC Help, the most common way to solve a connection issue is to connect to a different server. Click ""Servers"" on the left of the options menu, underneath ""Connect."" Select any server on the list, preferably one located near your geographic location. Select ""OK"" to switch to that server.


The servers are organized in different folders, such as ""EFnet"" and ""DALnet."" Each folder has its own collection of channels. If you're trying to join a specific channel, you'll need to know which network its own.

, If you can't use any of the servers, you may be using the wrong ""port,"" or entrance to the server. Select the server you wish to connect to and click ""Edit"" to change this. Most servers use port 6667, while servers in the DALnet network usually use port 7000 instead.Enter this number in the ""ports"" field and click ""OK.""

, Click on ""Identd"" on the left of the options menu, underneath ""Connect."" Make sure the ""Enable Identd server"" box is checked, so you can identify yourself to the IRC network of servers.

, Choose ""Options"" from the categories list and tick the box next to ""Connect on startup."" This will help you connect easily next time you try to use mIRC. You can also tick the box that says ""Reconnect on disconnection"" so you don't have to reconnect manually every time you lose your connection on mIRC.

, If you still can't connect, or if you encounter a more specific problem, read the mIRC help file that was downloaded with the program. You can also take a look at the extensive mIRC frequently asked questions webpage, or download it for off-line use.

Make arrangements to visit as much as you need to feel comfortable.

Be prepared for the ups and downs.,
Arrange a meeting with family and friends as soon as possible.",How to Make Your Online Lover a Reality," Once you have found Mr/Ms Right, be completely honest about who you are and what you are looking for. This is not the time to play. Many people use the internet to pretend. However, when you are dating remember that you are playing with people's hearts and minds. This is not the time to play unless you tell everyone you are playing.;
, Be very creative with your words, thoughts and actions. Remember you may be at a distance and you have the computer separating you, so you need to come on a little stronger than you would face to face.

, You can be casual in your conversation. Be alive, interested and energetic in your conversation. Avoid expressing loneliness and despair.

, This does not have to take up your day, but just 5-10 minutes here and there throughout the day can really make a difference.

, You will still need to see if this is the one all the way to the bank.

You've got the account, now what?,
Try an online dating profile makeover.,
First mission on giving you an online dating profile makeover is to talk about the pictures.,
Do not use pictures of you with your friends, or you at a party.,
First go to a tanning salon and a spa.,
Now if you do not have a digital camera, do not worry.,
Ok, now what you want is a decent head shot .,
The next thing you want to do is describe yourself accurately and honestly.,
Lastly, if you have a problem on any dating site with a member, and you feel uncomfortable with any communication, please remember to let the webmaster or owner of the online dating site know so that something may be done to keep your online dating experience a safe and successful one.

",How to Make Over Your Online Dating Profile," Ok, so you have an online dating site profile, or maybe you have several on different sites. You have some witty things in there about yourself and you put a couple of pictures you found from a couple years ago that look decent. Now, you’re sitting there and you're wondering why the responses aren’t coming in like you expected.;
, I am going to give you some helpful tips that will help your dating profile get the responses you want, and also help you feel better about yourself.

, What you want to do here is simple; get several pictures taken of yourself that will be recent and nice. You do not want to use pictures that are too revealing or too sexy. This will give the wrong impression.

, Do not use webcam pictures or video pictures that are grainy.


Do not take the picture yourself out of focus or from some crazy angle.
Do not use glamour shots, or old outdated photo’s because if you meet someone, they will eventually see the REAL you.

, Get a manicure and pedicure. Get a hair cut and for the men, shave your face and women get a facial. Now, for the best part, go shopping and get yourself something that you feel good about wearing. Treat yourself to a really nice day out doing all this.

, You can get yourself a disposable camera and take it to any drugstore or Walmart and get them developed and ask for a digital disk also. Now you have pictures you can add to your profile.

, Make sure you have someone take this picture with a lot of light so there is no need for a flash. Make sure to smile! Next take several pictures of yourself with a full standing view. Do not make the background to busy to distract people from seeing the real you.

, Do not be misleading and most importantly, do not give to much personal information. And finally, be courteous and answer all responses to your online dating profile quickly and politely. If you are not interested in someone who responds to your online dating profile, let them down politely.

Determine why you want to be in an internet relationship.,
Find an online community or service specific to your desires.,
Avoid sites that may be catered to desires and needs that are different from yours.,
Acquaint yourself with the rules of the online community in which you choose to seek romance.,
Respect others' feelings as you would in real life.,
Should you decide that you would like to take your relationship with your online paramour into the real world, be prepared for the possibility that he or she may not feel the same way.,
If a meeting outside the online world is decided upon, follow all the same rules you would if you were going on a blind date.",How to Have a Relationship over the Internet," Is it because you consider yourself non-sexual, but still romantic? Is it because you would like to experience romance through a virtual version of yourself? Is it because you are living in a remote location? Depending on your reasons, you may want to try different sites or methods for jumping in.;
, For example, if you want to embark on a romance in which you get to experience the relationship through a virtual version of yourself (perhaps a version that looks different or has a different history than you), you might want to try a site in which you live through an avatar, such as Second Life. Alternatively, if you want to have an online relationship because you seek romance, but not sex, there are specific sites for that as well., For example, do not go to an online dating site that presents married couples with kids as their success stories. An online-only relationship is not about such monumental real-life outcomes.

, As with shopping malls and dance clubs, there are going to be things you should or should not do of acceptable conduct. On some sites, for example, it might be unacceptable to approach another user with graphic requests. On other sites, this might be part of the culture.

, There are real people behind the words, icons, and avatars with which you are interacting. If, for example, you decide to be exclusively involved with one person in a community, do not cheat by becoming romantically involved with another.

, Some people are just in it for fun. Others might be agoraphobic, ashamed of their appearance, married, or in a completely different place.

, Be safe. Meet in a public place. Tell friends where you will be. Watch and listen for questionable behavior.Be optimistic, but prepared for potential disappointment.

New messages in a label can then be grouped, or ""bundled"", in your inbox. When you receive a new message in a bundled label, the bundle will be moved to the top of your inbox.


Bundles make organizing your incoming messages much simpler, and let you see at a glance what your new messages are about.
Google Inbox automatically bundles certain types of messages into the Travel, Purchases, Finance, Social, Updates, Forums, and Promos labels.;
, Bundles will appear in your inbox based on their delivery time settings. Tapping the bundle will show all of the new messages that are in it.


Depending on the content of your bundle, you may be able to scroll right and left to see everything in the bundle.
These instructions work the same for the browser version of Google Inbox.

, Your bundled labels will be listed first, followed by your unbundled labels.


Labels that are unbundled will show each new message with that label as it arrives.

, After you're finished with a message, you can swipe it to the right or tap the checkmark to mark it as Done. This will hide it from the inbox.

, You can mark all of the messages in a bundle as done by ""Sweeping"" the bundle. Swipe the bundle to the right in your inbox or tap the Sweep button when the bundle is open to mark every message in the bundle as Done. This will hide the bundle from the inbox (until a new message in the bundle is received)

,, You can do this by selecting a bundle from your Inbox, or by opening the Google Inbox menu and selecting any of your bundled or unbundled labels.



Click here for instructions on creating new labels.

, It looks like a gear at the top of the screen.

, Every label can be bundled in your inbox. This will group all incoming messages that match the label under the label's name in your inbox.


Tap the ""Bundle message's in inbox"" slider to turn bundling ON or OFF.

, This option only appears when bundling is switched off.

, You can set your bundled messages to only appear once a day or once a week, which can be useful for messages that don't require immediate action.


By default, bundled messages will appear in your inbox as soon as they are received.

, Tap the notifications slider ON or OFF to toggle your notification settings. If notifications are off, your phone will not alert you when a new message in the bundle is received.

, By adding new messages to the appropriate bundle, your bundles will become more effective.

Tap the menu button at the top of the screen.
Select the bundle you want to move the message(s) into.

For an Apple device, click here to download the app, and for an Android device, click here.;
, Google will ask you to sign in to your Gmail account within the Inbox app. This just takes a flash, and then you'll be good to start using the app.

, Some features of Google Inbox are very similar to Gmail but have their own names. Becoming familiar with these terms will help as you get used to Inbox:


Inbox lets you mark any email or reminder as ""Done"" by selecting the checkmark next to or above it, or swiping to the right. This is similar to Gmail's archive; it doesn't delete the item, but moves it out of your inbox and places it in your ""Done"" folder.
Inbox uses ""Move to Trash"" in place of Gmail's ""Delete"".
Inbox uses ""Move to Spam"" in place of Gmail's ""Report Spam.""
Both services use ""Compose"" to mean write a new email.
Inbox's ""Pinning"" is very similar to starring an email in Gmail. This marks it for your attention and keeps it in your inbox.

, You'll see most emails listed chronologically, similar to your regular Gmail inbox. However, by default certain types of emails are bundled together by label to maximize inbox efficiency. These bundles gather all your recent emails from a label in one spot, rather than having them take up extra vertical space in your inbox. Read more on this below.


To navigate through a bundled set of emails, find the topic/label in your inbox list, and then open it to see all of the emails it contains. Tap or click on any particular email to expand it.

, Labels and bundles are two of the main functions of Google Inbox, and mastering them will allow you to maximize your email efficiency.



Labels are how Google Inbox sorts your incoming mail. By setting filters when creating a label, you can sort your incoming mail into categories that are useful to you. Google Inbox comes with several premade labels that it will attempt to sort the bulk of your mail into.

Bundles collect all new mail for that label in one spot in your inbox. These bundles act as a holding area for your new mail, keeping your inbox uncluttered. Each l;abel can have its own bundle in your inbox, and bundling is enabled on a label-by-label basis. When a label is unbundled, each individual message will appear in your inbox.

, Press the three little lines (☰) in the top left-hand corner to open your menu. This menu will show you the standard email folders, with some fresh Inbox spin:


You'll see your Inbox, Snoozed, and Done labels at the top. ""Inbox"" contains new emails and reminders, the ""Snoozed"" section contains emails you've asked the app to remind you about later, and ""Done"" contains all the emails and reminders you've marked as completely handled.
You'll also see folders for Drafts, Sent, Reminders, Trash, and Spam. Click on any of these to see the contained messages, much as you would in classic Gmail.
Beneath the system folders, you'll find all of the labels you've created. These will be sorted by Bundled and Unbundled. Any labels that you created in Gmail can be found here.

, If you want to create a new label to sort specific emails into, you can quickly create a new label from with the Google Inbox app or website. When creating a new label, you can choose whether or not you want it to be bundled in your inbox.



Click here for detailed instructions on creating new labels and bundles.

, By default, Inbox sets up bundled labels for emails related to Travel, Purchases, Finance, Social, Updates, Forums, and Promos. Inbox will attempt to automatically sort the majority of your mail into these categories. You can change the settings for any of your labels to bundle or unbundle them.


Open the Google Inbox menu (☰).
Select the label you want to change settings for.
Click or tap the Settings button (it looks like a gear).

,


You can select whether to bundle the messages under that label or display them each separately in your inbox.
You can select whether to show the bundle each time as messages arrive, or only once per day or once per week.
You can select whether you want notifications on or off for emails which have that label attached (mobile only).

, For example, if you set up a label for all emails from your mother-in-law, and want them to skip your inbox altogether and be marked as done without notifying you, your Inbox label settings will get the job done!

, When you receive a new email, it'll show up in your inbox, unless you have it set to skip the inbox and go straight to ""Done."" When you get a new email, you can view the subject, sender, and a snippet of the contents direct from your inbox. To read the rest, click on it and the email will expand.


From the expanded email view, you'll be able to reply or forward the email, as usual. You'll also be able to pin it, snooze it, mark it done, or group it by label(s).

, One big feature of Inbox is that you can ""pin"" any important emails that need your attention. This will keep them in your inbox, and is similar to starring important emails in Gmail.


When you select the Pin toggle at the top of your inbox, only pinned emails will appear. Use this to get an overview of what emails you have sitting in your inbox that still require your attention.
When you're done with an email, you can remove it from your pinned list by tapping the pin again. You can also mark it done and remove it from your inbox by clicking the Done checkmark.

, If you don't want to deal with an email right now but know that you will need it again later, you can press the clock at the top, or swipe the email left from your inbox. Set either one of the default time options or pick your own date/time or place, and Google Inbox will drop the email into the top of your inbox again at the right time.

, Hit the checkmark or swipe the email right to do this. Marking an email done is like archiving it: If you've read it, replied as needed, and decided you don't need to pin or snooze it, you can mark it done and get it out of your inbox.


Emails marked as done are still available in the ""Done"" folder or under any label that they're categorized as, but they won't clutter up your inbox anymore.

, If you want to add or change a label on an email you're reading, click the three dots in the top right-hand corner. This will open a menu that says ""Move to.""


Click on whatever label/folder you want to apply, and Inbox will take care of the re-labeling for you.

, Inbox retains the powerful search feature of Gmail. To find an email by sender, subject, or contents, click on the magnifying glass at the top right-hand corner of the app and enter your query.


The app will pull up any matching results, and you can select one to read in detail.
See this guide for details on searching Google Inbox.

, If you want to select more than one email from your current list of messages, you can click the circle to the left of the email. It will either have an icon or avatar, or the first letter of the sender's name. When you click it, it'll turn into a checkmark.

You can keep selecting all the emails you want from the list, before hitting the trash can, pin icon, snooze icon, or done checkmark to move them all to that state.

, To reply to an email, click on the arrow in the circle button at the bottom-right, or simply scroll all the way down the email thread until you see the ""Reply"" or ""Reply to all"" textbox. Type your response and then click send.


If you want to expand the textbox to make it bigger, click the button that looks like an upwards and downwards arrow, in the top-right of the text area. This will pop out the whole email text area and give you more space to compose your reply.
If you want to reply to a certain message in the thread but not the whole thread, click the three dots next to the timestamp for that particular email message, then select ""Reply"" or ""Reply all."" You can also forward the email from there if you'd like.

, From your inbox, click the big red plus sign to start a new email. This will suggestion recipients you've recently corresponded with, or you can click the red ""Compose"" button again to start an email from a blank slate.


Make sure you fill out the ""To"" field with the recipient address and your subject and email contents before sending. You can add an attachment by clicking on the paper clip icon, if desired, and then send your email by selecting the paper airplane icon in the top right-hand corner.

, If you want to write yourself a reminder, you don't have to email yourself anymore: Inbox builds this feature right in. Select the big red plus sign from your inbox and then click Reminder (the icon is a string tied around a finger). Fill out what you want to remember.


Reminders are ""smart""; a drop-down menu will give you some options based on your location, contacts, and more. For example, you might select ""Call Bob"" or ""Call Bob's Hair Salon in New York, NY"" and Google will fill in the details for you.
Select the clock to set a time or place when you want Inbox to give you the reminder. If you don't set a time or place, the reminder will just go straight into your inbox, pinned at the current time.

Draw your dolls.,
Follow the rules.,
Share your dolls, whether on the Internet or in real life, so you can receive feedback, recognition, and constructive criticism.

",How to Doll," Some people say that Microsoft Paint is really all you need (which definitely is if your making simple ones, or your not a 'serious' doller), but some say you need special software. It's best to use a cheap or free program such as Paint or Gimp when you're beginning. Start by using pre-made bases until you're more skilled.


When dolling you can make the proportions as unrealistic or as realistic as you like, but just make sure you only draw things one pixel at a time, rather then quickly scribbling a picture.;
,


Don't copy what someone else made by changing the color or snatching the outline and call it your own. Not only is it wrong, but where's the feeling of accomplishment?
If you used someone's base, give proper credit. Include the base and a link. You could otherwise get in trouble for copyright.
Comply with the rules of the forum if you are posting your dolls on a forum. Common rules include:



No spamming
No attacking
No double-posting

, Now, we get started! Find a good 50x50 icon by searching dA or an image hosting service. If you have the means, which you should if you don't have a monstrously old computer without paint, you can make your own. You can crop an image, original or not, and save it as a .gif preferably (especially if it's animated), or as a .png if it contains a lot of transparencies.

, When you log in, go to your settings which can be found in the tool bar. While there, you can also change your ""signature"", which will show up whenever you make a comment on someone else's work. Look around at popular pieces of art and look at the sayings under people's comments to get some ideas, though you should just do something original. Signatures can get old and show that you would just rather sway with the crowd than be creative. Begin a journal also. If you have something interesting to say, say it. Many people like to know ""the-day-in-the-life-of"" and it certainly helps gain views when you have some fans.

, But, here comes the safety part! Do not steal someone else's work under any circumstances. It may seem tempting but you can get banned from certain areas (i.e. forums or the chat rooms) or possibly the entire website, unable to reclaim the screen name of your banned account. Art theft is also a felony and you can have charges pressed upon you.

, This is important, especially if you are trying to appeal to specific types of art critics. Creating digital art of Naruto, or Bleach, and of popular books like Harry Potter are good ways to gain page views though can be looked down upon by more talented members if your artistic ability doesn't show promise for original art work. Artistic topics can be overdone and the previous subjects have been overdone. If you have a camera, take lots of photos, but make sure the photography can be considered artistic and are within the guidelines of the site. This is not Myspace and do not ""cam whore"" for anything other than personal profile use.


If you draw fanart for something that's very popular, like Harry Potter, be aware that you will have a much harder time getting fans.

, Your first works will pale in comparison to works produced after practice, and they will also gain a slight following which will continue to grow as your skill improves. Practice makes perfect.

, When you feel ready, go out in the forums or chat rooms to help people get to know you and your art. Please do not be rude in the process. Simply talking nicely, or even just entering a chat room is enough to have people view your page. ""Advertising"" yourself can get you banned or ignored.

, Doing this will help your popularity on deviantART showing your art to those who have there deviantART homepage on ""newest"". This may add a new ""fan"" of your work or better said, a new friend. However, make sure it is of good quality and you did your best on it because if ever it may not be that good it won't bring in much attention.

, See what art is most popular by looking at the most popular in 24 hours, if you have enough time try doing their themes, see if you can also do it. If ever there is a certain new trend in fan art see if you'd like it too maybe you'd like this and decide to make fan arts too!

, If you're the drawing type of artist, why not start your own comics or if you're a writer at heart why not post some of your stories? There are a lot of bored artists on deviantART, if it's that good you'd probably even get fan art

, There are many different kinds of artists on deviantART and probably a lot who share many similarities as you. Asking for requests is one way to get your own art publicized by showing your own drawings of your characters and asking others to draw them will shine some light on your characters. Paying for commissions is one way to also show your work to artists who are not open for requests, but make sure you got some money, if not look for point commissions hopefully you can save up your points through the point-llama badge trade! Try to catch a kiri ban! Kiri bans are when you try to catch a certain amount of page views, usually it's a promotion for many artists, well recommended for those who can't pay for commissions in any way. Last of all, art trades, it's a benefit for both sides yet depending on the artist you choose to trade with, you might get rejected.

, If you want to browse art on a specific subject, use the following URL instead, following ""popular+"" with any word that describes what you're looking for:http://backend.deviantart.com/rss.xml?q=boost%3Apopular+topic

To search for multiple words, separate them with a plus (topic+topic). Compare the feeds for fish+bear compared to the feed for fishbear to see the difference.

, Each RSS reader or browser is organized a little differently. Many, but not all of them, will link directly to full-size images. Look for links to ""media files,"" or any links below the image that do not lead directly to the deviantART post.

There is an arrow button next to the typing space. Click it when you are done typing. Or you can press Return, or Enter as it is on my computer. This button, when clicked, will post your message for everyone to see.
You can add emoticons to your message. You can even buy more emoticons with ""xats"", which is the currency on Xat. But Xats are hard to get, so be sure that you don't use them unwisely and waste them!
Always remember that you should follow the rules of a chat box. Ask the owner of the chat box for rules,or if you already know them, just start to follow them as you come to the chat box.
Keep in mind that you could get Kicked or worse, Banned. Kicking doesn't really hurt you. It is just an expression of annoyance to the person who is being kicked. Banning does. It will suspend you from the chat box forever. Always follow the rules.

, Your posts can be seen here, too. You can also see the person's picture and username.


In this box, you can see your own picture and username too. You can click your username to edit your profile.

, It displays the total number of people, the people on or off, and the guests.


The total number of people registered as members on the chat box and the guests currently on are displayed there. It tells if they are on or not. A red guy means they're off, and a green guy means they are guests, and a blue guy means they are on.
By clicking on your name in the box, you can also change your profile.

, You will see a bar containing different links (like the doodle tool.) Explore these links carefully and find out what they do. You may need to use them someday.

The links are mostly for fun, but still you might need them someday, maybe for a certain chat box who are playing a doodling game or such.

, That's the whole point of it!

Alternatively, you can check the boxes next to any existing labels and click ""Apply"" to add the selected labels to a message.

Check the ""Also apply filter to matching conversations"" box to retroactively apply the filter to messages you've received.

, If you use the Inbox website or mobile app, you can use it to create and manage your labels. The process is virtually identical for both the website and the app, as the website's design is meant to mimic the mobile app.


Inbox is a new email service from Google. It works in conjunction with Gmail to help manage your daily email.

, You can swipe in from the left side of the screen to open the menu. It is open by default on the website. The ""Create new"" button can be found by scrolling to the bottom of your list of labels.

, You'll be able to select from most of the rules available in Gmail, including sender address, subject line, keywords, and exclusions. Tap or click the ""From"" menu to select different criteria.

, You'll be taken back to the label settings and your new rule will appear at the top.

, When you bundle messages in Inbox, all messages that have the same label will be collected together in one place. This can make it easier to find and manage multiple emails in a certain label.

If you do bundle, you can select when to push the bundle to the top of your inbox (every time a new message arrives, once a day, or once a week).

, You can browse all of your different labels in the Inbox menu. Selecting a label will display all of the messages in it. Bundled labels will also appear in your inbox if you have unread messages in them.

, If you receive a new message and want to quickly add it to an existing label, you can do so directly from the message.


Tap or click the ⋮ button at the top of the message.
Select the label you want to add it to. You can also choose to create a new label from this menu.

, From your Gmail inbox, click the ""apps"" button in the top right corner (it looks like a small square grid). Click ""more"", then click the ""Even more from Google"" option. You’ll be directed to Google’s Product page. Here, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the small ""Contact us"" link. This will take you to the Google Contact page, which has lots of options for getting in touch with Google about your Gmail problem.

, Once you access the contact page, you have several options for notifying Google of your questions or concerns. Your first is to use the reporting feature for online privacy and security problems. Under the ""Report a safety or abuse issue affecting a Google product"" header, select ""Gmail"" from the drop-down menu. On the next screen, browse through topics until you find one that matches your issue, then follow the on-screen instructions.Note that this option (and others in this article) may require you to include the message-ID of the email for which you experienced problems. To do this, you'll need to view the entire message header — instructions for doing this are available on the Gmail support website, support.google.com., If your Gmail account doesn't seem to work correctly — for instance, if it's not receiving messages your friends send you — there may be a technical issue keeping it from functioning properly. In this case, the Google Help Center, which has lots of information on how to fix common problems, is a wise choice. From the Contact page, click the ""Browse our help center"" option at the top of the page. On the next page, click ""Gmail"", then start browsing through the options for your exact issue.

, If you'd rather read and respond to actual human beings, the Google help forum may be the best option. Here, users are free to post their questions and problems and have them responded to by technical staff from Google. You can easily search through these past posts to find an answer to your problem by typing your problem into the search bar. If you don't find the information you're looking for, you can also start your own post, which others will be able to respond to.To get to the Help Forum, on the Contact page, simply click the ""Browse popular help forum discussions"" link underneath the Help Center button. On the next page, you can search for your issue by typing a description of it into the search bar.
If you don't get a satisfactory answer from your search, click the ""Post a Question"" link at the top of the screen to write your own post. Describe your problem as well as you can and a Google staff member or another user may be able to help you find a solution.

, For the most personal, in-depth level of customer support, try using Google's ""Helpouts"" service. This service allows users to schedule appointments with real experts on a huge variety of topics, then receive a live one-on-one tutorial session via video chat. For instance, if you're having trouble with your Gmail account, you might type ""Gmail"" into the Helpouts search bar to see a selection of Gmail experts who are available to help you.


To access the Helpouts service, simply go to helpouts.google.com. Alternatively, from the Contacts page, press the back button on your browser to return to the ""Even more from Google"" page, then click the link for the Helpouts service near the top of the page.
Note that since Help out sessions are essentially appointments with trained experts, they usually cost money (the price for each expert is clearly listed on his or her ad). However, some experts offer their first appointment for free.

, If you're having trouble accessing your Gmail account or sending and receiving messages, the problem may be due to a service outage on Google's end. To check the status of Google's App products (including Gmail), visit the Apps Status Dashboard at google.com/appsstatus. With this handy tool, you can see all past and present service issues for Google's online products — Gmail is at the very top of the dashboard.The dashboard is set up like a table or spreadsheet with dates running along the top and Google's apps running down the left side. Note that blank cells indicate no problems, while red or yellow dots respectively indicate service outages or minor issues on the indicated days.

, Technical problems are far from the only reason why you may want to contact Google. For instance, if you wanted to comment that you're unhappy with a new feature added to the service, rather than using the typical technical support resources, you'll probably want to use Google's feedback feature. This solution allows you to voice your thoughts to Google in as little as a minute with easy-to-follow onscreen suggestions, making it a time-saving choice for novice users or those with non-essential issues.


To use the feedback feature, navigate back to your Gmail inbox, then press the cog-shaped icon in the top right. In the drop-down menu, click ""Send feedback"". Follow the prompts in the window that pops up — you'll be asked to briefly describe your problem, visually highlight areas of the page that are giving you difficulties, and finally confirm your submission.

Connect to the server you wish to connect to.

,
Press 'Alt+R' or click the green box with /a in it to open the scripts menu.,
Before you start to make scripts in mIRC you should learn about aliases.

,
Play with your alias tab to begin with, making simple commands such as: /j /join $$1 - This command will allow you to just say ""/j #test"" and join the #test channel.

,
Learn about identifiers!,
Click the 'Remotes' tab to edit the script.ini file containing every scripts your client can use.,
Press 'OK' and ask someone to type !pie and someone's name.,
Test: !Pie Krystle

,
PieBot: Test just gave Krystle a pie!

,
If it doesn't work, make sure your script reads as follows: on :TEXT:!pie*:#:msg # $nick just gave $$1 a a pie!

,
Keep trying it out and experimenting.

,, (In mIRC 6.3+ it is now an image of a scroll.)

,,, Say ""/help remote identifiers"" for the help page that has a great list of them.

,


Type on *:, in the text area section of the Remotes window. That will make your script execute whatever the level (voice, halfop, operator, etc) of the user calling you for the script is.
Type TEXT: right next to it. TEXT will specify that the script will look in text queries. You could have replaced it with ACTION for /me commands. There are also Join, Connect, Part, Kick, Ban, Op, Dope, and many many others.
Type !pie*: next to that. That will specify the script to look for the word !pie followed with anything next to it (!pie hello will trigger the script as well as !pie face or simply !pie). The asterisk is a wildcard input, that tells the script to accept anything in it's place.
Type #: to activate the script in every channels you are in. You could also specify a certain channel (I.E. #wikihow:). You can substitute the # with a ? so it only responds to private messages (PM's) instead. Or use the wildcard input (Asterisk *) so it'll work for both.
Type msg # $nick just gave $$2 a pie! to send a message on the channel where the query has been executed. You should now have a full script in your script.ini file.

, When they type !pie (With someone's name) it should display the following sentence, replacing $nick with the name of the person who said ""!pie"" and $$1 with whatever they say after !pie as well. Example:

Choose a channel name.,
Join the chosen channel.,
Register the channel with the ChanServ bot.,
The channel is now registered!

,
When you want to become a channel operator again, ask ChanServ.",How to Set up Your Own IRC Channel on Freenode.Net," IRC channel names start with a #, and Freenode's policy dictates that ""off topic"" channels should start with ##; e.g. ##mychannel.;
,


Use the /join ##mychannel command.
If the channel was empty, it will be created and you will automatically become a ""channel operator"" (sometimes ""chanop"" or ""op""). Ops are allowed to manage the channel – for example, to ban abusers.
If the network doesn't give you op rights, it means the channel is already registered by somebody else.

, This makes sure nobody else can take over the channel.

These features include generating chat transcripts to review chat operator competence, leveraging web analytics to assess website performance, and tracking visitor behavior with the help of your application’s visitor monitoring attributes. You are already paying for all these features. You might as well use them.;
, Research past inquiries received through all your service channels, live chat, phone and email. Pick out the questions you receive frequently and script customized answers to these questions. Serve up these answers with a single mouse click each time your customers ask these questions through live chat. Make sure that the answers match the question 100% otherwise script an individualized response also called a free-hand response. Canned messages take only a mouse click to send to your customers and tend to save heavily on support resources.

, The faster your chat reps process chat queries, the more customer support dollars you will save.

Phone support is significantly more expensive than live chat support, according to dozens of studies.

Community based sites save you time because it means just about everyone on the site will be in your area and the site itself won't ask you a lot of personal questions or let a computer program determine potential compatibility with someone. If you do use a site that employs such profiling techniques, remember what each person has to say about himself or herself will tell you a lot more about the individual than how much money she claims to make or what his favorite food is.;

Give some of your interests, but be specific. Don't just say you like music. Who doesn't like music? List some bands and composers you like. If you like to exercise, what kind of exercise do you do? Oh, and always state your age and give the age range you're looking within. Your honesty will invariably save a lot of time.

, Always meet in a public place where you are sure there will be lots of people. Tell a friend where you are going or better yet bring one along. Any reasonable person you are thinking of meeting will be nervous too and will understand these precautions.

, Remember you and your date still don't know each other very well and because you have only just met in person, you will have to do a little more work to get to know each other. However, remember you don't have all the time in the world and you won't develop feelings for everyone you meet. The Internet has a full cast of weird, flakey and bitter people, but there are a lot of good people out there too, You just have to be willing to put in the work to find one.

Consider creating a safety plan.",How to Date Online Safely," It is easy to get too involved in online dating relationships; for some it can lead to an addiction. Some find themselves enjoying the flirtatious advances of the opposite sex, both in chat rooms and with on-line dating services. People get sucked into on-line relationships and become addicted to the world of on-line dating and chat rooms. For some it becomes an obsession. The classic story is a person who finds himself or herself divorced after 20+ years, followed by a string of unhappy relationships, and eventually finds solace in a chat room.;
, You can create a persona quite different from yourself. You can act out a part, instead of being a real person. There are characters online ready to prey on the unwary and naive.

, There is addiction, obsessiveness, vindictiveness, desperation, impulsiveness, and even downright guilt. Love is a powerful emotion. Do not follow your heart over your head. Don't journey outside your comfort zone and be overtaken by a seductive search for true companionship.

, Tell yourself, ""I'll keep the relationship at the e-mail level before deciding to talk on the phone!"" Yes, take baby steps to discover if you have a great deal in common. You can enjoy chat rooms, but be aware where it can lead you if you are not savvy.

, Why did you get into online dating--a success story from a friend, or just no luck anywhere else? Lots of books have been written on this subject. You must read a few if you are thinking of entering this medium.

, There are online safety tips that must be followed for children, not just yourself.

, It's easy to build relationships via the internet. The attraction to online dating is how easy it is to fill out a profile and suddenly have a list of ""Top 10"" matches. If you're too needy, you think how close you are to long walks on the beach and even experiencing a falling star together! Realize that for every one of the stories that you hear about meeting and dating the perfect man, there are stories of relationships that end traumatically when a date's wife answers the phone. Don't let an online dating experience go from the chat room to the psychiatrist's couch; temper your expectations and be prepared.

, Communication has gotten much faster with mobile phones, SMS, internet relay Chat, instant messaging, ICQ. You can be surfing the Web and up pops a message from a potential lover. The nice thing about Internet dating is that you can do it at your own pace without taking time away from work. But don't let that rush you into anything. There are unfortunately a lot of opportunities for the unsavory members of our society.

, Online dating has led to kidnapping and murder more than a couple of times, so make a plan with your friends.


Take a picture of the date's license plate and their face to send to a friend.
Ask your friend to call your twice within the date, preferably a couple hours a part.
For both calls and for texts, create code words that sound like every day sentences for in case you feel unsafe, in case you are alone with the date and they won't let you leave, or if you're in the process of being kidnapped.

Decide what type of online dating site best suits the type of people you are looking to meet as well as your budget.,
Subscribe.,
Take (at least) one good picture.,
Create your profile.,
Identify people you would like to meet.,
Check for reviews about them.,
Contact them.,
Talk by phone.",How to Find a Date Online," If you are looking to meet a broad spectrum of people, you might try a large public site like Match.com or Yahoo! personals. If you are looking to meet a specific type of person you might try a more niche-focused site like JDate or AsianFriendFinder.com.;
, Keep in mind, there is a broad range of prices for online dating sites. More expensive sites can charge as much as $50 per month. Most sites offer discounts for multiple months purchased at one time. When you are just starting, you should probably buy just one month and see how well you like that site. If you do and want to continue, you can re-subscribe for a larger number of months at a lower monthly rate. Many sites (like EZDate 123 and Plenty of Fish) also have free trials.

, Whether you are a male or female, having at least one flattering, recent photo will dramatically increase your chances for success. Profiles with good pics usually get as much as 10 to 20 times as many e-mails. If you get an overwhelming number of e-mails (often happens for especially attractive females), you can always choose to hide your pic later. If you don't have a good recent pic, some sites offer links to professional photographers. But usually just a digital camera with some decent lighting will do the trick.

, Each site asks for slightly different information and/or essays. Try to keep it simple, but if you're witty, let that show. Your opening line is important and usually what will set you apart from others. The best advice is to just be yourself, since you will find it is very difficult to be convincing acting like someone else. Even still, you definitely want to put your best foot forward. No need to disclose that you're still hurting from your recent break-up or you visit a therapist 5 times per week here. There will be time for that later once someone gets to see the fun, easy-going, more attractive side of you.

, Now for the fun part, browse through profiles or search by keywords to find the people you think you might like to meet. Women, don't feel like you have to wait for men to contact you. It is perfectly acceptable to make the first contact with a man, and you will often have excellent results when you do.

, Before you meet someone online, or even before you contact them, you should check to see if other people who have met them have entered reviews regarding the truthfulness of their profile. Do this by visiting a review site like and entering the correct dating site and profile ID for the person in question. If you date the person yourself, you can also enter a review yourself to help future people who will meet them.

, Send them an email or if you prefer, IM them. Be natural, be conversational, mention a detail from their profile so they know you really read it, and make a little joke. Humor is great for breaking the ice and starting the conversation.

, After you've traded enough emails to feel comfortable, the next step is usually to talk by phone. This gives you a chance to get to know the other person a little better and get a feel for whether you will have chemistry in person. Don't feel obligated to meet someone in person just because you have talked to them by phone. If you feel uncomfortable or not attracted, you can tell them, ""It's been great talking with you. I'm busy the rest of this week. Why don't we talk again next week."" This way you can harmlessly end the call without an outright rejection, and if you find you change your mind you can always call them or accept their call next week.

Be open minded.,
Be true to yourself.,
Do it your way and don't change for anyone.,
Be choosy.,
Don't be so desperate.",How to Date Online and Keep Your Self Respect," Online dating is nothing but going with the ever changing times. We look for work online, we shop online, we bank online, it is the way of the now and there is no loss of self respect in doing so. Other people are putting themselves out there trying to meet someone just like you and you should not deprive them of a wonderful human that is sensitive enough to feel concerned about putting themselves out there, after all that is the type of person you'd like to meet too.;
, Being concerned about your self respect while online dating is a show of your true identity and what strikes a chord with you and your moral make-up. If you did not feel a bit shy about putting yourself out there you would not be the humble, good heart that YOU are. It will exude from you in the profile that you post. Just because you decide to try to find someone compatible online as well as in everyday walking life does not mean that you have to morph into someone you do not know and like.

, There are plenty of people that are online that are not going to want to show you kindness, a lot that actually might want to get the best of you, so you must stick to whatever guidelines you use in your everyday life. If you wouldn't kinky talk with someone when you are staring them eyeball to eyeball then do not do it online just because they may want you to and because their picture and profile makes you think of Matthew McConaughey (or Eva Longoria or whatever!)does not mean you have to lose your self respect and do it for them. Do everything just as you would all the time.

, Keeping your self respect while dating online should be easy as long as you stick to who you are and what you truly want. You do not need to put it all out there and tell everyone that you are getting older and want kids in the next year, but you can use your radar and seek out those profiles that seem genuine. We all have an inner guide that tells us when something is not kosher with something and we need to use it while online dating. Read, read, read profiles (make it an all day Sunday thing if you like), pick out the best ones and reach out to say one a day.

, Do not be so inclined to meet someone that you take the first guy that emails you and run off to another state to meet him. Online dating can be a lengthy process and you could potentially be seeking for a year or more. That is okay because similar to other online meet sites, some people end up being just email friends or phone friends or whatever type of friend you like. You may even dismiss a lot of people as just not your type even though they are great for someone else. Keeping your standards keeps your self respect intact.

Finished.

",How to Converse with a Guy Online," Choose ""hey"" rather than ""hi"". Ask him, ""how's it going?"", or ""what's up?"". If he asks you the same thing, don't say ""same"" because that will give him an impression that you are dull. Tell him anything about your day, even if it was stupid. (Saying 'nothing' could make it a dead-end conversation.) That would make him laugh and think that you have a good sense of humor!;
, Don't tell him what a bad day you've had - at least at the first chat, save that until you know him better. Otherwise, you may come off as gloomy or boring.

, Get yourself a webcam, and get on to him. That not only gives him something to talk to, it gives him things to talk about. You can now show him things in the room or on yourself. If he has one too, ask if you can watch, if he doesn't offer. Be careful not to expose too much!

, Questions like ""Did you see that movie?"" is one of them. The answer would be either Yes or No. That's too short. Elaborate and say ""That movie looks pretty good. I wanna go see it sometime."" It can give both of you a new topic. Do not forget to reply to everything he said.

, Don't talk about yourself all the time, considering you may come off as self-centered and self-obsessed.

, When he says he has to go or if you have to go, say something like ""I'll see you tomorrow"" or ""talk to you later"". Something that will imply future plans or chats with him.

, Chat with him often enough to keep in touch, but not every single day. There is a chance it will become less and less special if it becomes too frequent.

, It's much better to ask him out in person. When it comes to more serious times in a relationship, never ask anybody out online. This also works with break-ups.

Stay out of the bathroom.,
Submit more than one photo.,
Look into the camera.,
Don’t be so serious.,
Use a photographer.",How to Create the Perfect Online Dating Photo," Perhaps you’re proud of your six-pack abs and want the world to see how hard you’ve worked to get them, but the truth is that no one respects any online dater who’s half-naked in their photo. And while it’s attractive to see a woman in her bikini, she will more often than not attract the wrong attention and give off the wrong vibe. So keep your clothes on and focus on your face.;
, Make sure that online daters can see your face; don’t sport sunglasses or a hat that shadows your features. People want to see your face; that’s the whole point of why they’re surfing through online dating profiles.

, While it’s great that you’re popular, and perhaps you just think you look great in a particular picture with all your friends, your online dating photo and profile are all about you.

, You’re better off using a real camera to take your photos and using those. Web cam shots never do a person justice.

, Opt for a more appropriate room of the house if you’d like to take a photo of yourself; I’m sure you have a mirror somewhere else in the house, too.

, People want to see you and submitting more than one photo of yourself can only work in your favor. Most profiles list how many photos are in your profile, so if someone is interested in you and sees that you have 3 more photos, guess what? Click. That’s what they’ll do onto your profile and perhaps a wink might go alongside it.

, Instead of trying to be artistic with your photos, opt instead to look straight into the camera and give your best eye contact.

, The last thing you want to do is come off as angry or too serious for your own good, especially if that’s not who you are at all. Don’t be afraid to show some teeth and give a genuine smile in your photos. You don’t have to go “all gums”, but it would be nice to see a slight tinge of happiness in your face.

, A digital camera and an honest friend will work wonders to help you get the right photos of yourself on your online dating profile.

Do not cheat.,
Do not stay with them if you do not feel comfortable with this relationship.,
Meet in a place with lots of people around when you both are comfortable.,
Consider not meeting with them and keeping your relationship as a friendship.

Don't feel that because you are male, you are not vulnerable; these precautions are for anyone contemplating such a relationship.

, Of course the picture needs to be of you and not some actor that you think the opposite sex will find attractive, but you do need to take the time to make sure the picture shows you in the best possible light. As far as physical first impressions go your picture in your online profile is that first impression so be honest with it but make it your best impression possible.

, Make sure that you ask simple questions like ""Oh, you have a band? What do you play?"" like a normal conversation. Learn as much as you can about him. Online relationships are the same as normal relationships, so conversations shouldn't be much different.

, Lying in any relationship is bad. You don't want to get caught in it later or forget what you said because you will feel foolish and your relationship won't be strong because you won't trust each other.

, Just because it is an online relationship, and it is easier to get away with cheating, does not mean you should cheat. It is not right by any means and it is not fair to the other person.

, If they seem pressuring to meet and you do not want to, stand your ground. It's better to be safe than sorry.

, This would include busy restaurants, busy shopping malls, and any other busy place you can go. Do not invite them to your home until your relationship is healthy, steady, and you have been with them for quite a while to ensure as much safety as possible.


Take friends with you on any meeting with someone you have only met online, even in a busy place.

,, Some of these online dating websites are getting pretty sophisticated in the way they match up people but that does not mean that they cannot make mistakes. Another important dating tip is to always check someone out for yourself before you accept a date from them. Just because an emotionless computer thinks you may be a good match for someone does not mean that you are. Look their profile over and email them a few times before making the decision to meet.

, Send small gifts such as chocolate, flowers, a card, etc. Send them to their place of work so they have something to cheer them up in the middle of the day. If they don't work, send them to their home. Don't make it too frequent, though, or they'll make it a habit of receiving those gifts.;
, When you're not talking online, go out on dates if they live nearby. Take them out to the movies, or a fair going on nearby. Small dates do wonders for these types of relationships.

, Take a break every once in a while from talking to them. You don't need to be conversing 24/7 and make sure it does not interfere with work/school/etc.

Sure, they may just be a lonely model, but how likely is that?;
, If someone is desperate to sound good, they may not remember that something like 6' and 95 lbs is not proportional, unless their diet is insane.

, It's up to you whether you're willing to get involved in an affair or not, but just remember this: if they've lied about their marital status, what else could they be lying about?

, A scammer's occupation is usually some type of ""Engineer"" for men and a ""Model"" for women. It's just another way to make themselves sound like a good pick. Engineers make heaps of money, and models normally look beautiful. Now doesn't that sound amazing?

, Use this to do a Google search to see if shows up on other websites. If the profile is for another photo or perhaps man or woman, this person may be using the words verbatim and is a fraudster.

If they list they have a specific car or boat; check what kind of mileage they get or brand of boat.
Ask about a particular restaurant in the city and Google the address.
Ask how to get there from another easily accessed address close to this; for example, McDonalds is on First Street there, so is that next to the XXXX? Google Maps will usually show street names and even a street picture to help you gauge the accuracy of the response.

, Scammers often use the phrase ""Remember the distance or color does not matter, but love matters a lot in life"". That phrase is used in a lot of love scam emails.

, Although they could simply enjoy IM chatting more, what they say in IM may not be reportable to the website, allowing their profile to stay up so they can draw in other people.

, While plenty of people have bad grammar or spelling, see if it's inconsistent with the way people speak from where they claim to be. Also, if it is audio chat, see if his/her accent is what he/she claimed it to be (if the scammer happened to mention that before, of course).

, Scammers do not like to answer personal questions about themselves and will often misspell the cities they say they are from. If they are unfamiliar with any of the local landmarks and attractions, this is another sign. If they claim to be from a foreign country, steer clear immediately, no matter how charming they are.

, At the very least, it will show you that they are the person in the picture. Even better, video chat with them if they have a webcam. It does not, however, mean that everything they say is the truth. Services like Chatroulette can be manipulated to show a photo of, say, celebrities, instead of their real selves.

, Early on if the relationship is getting 'established' it is not strange to ask your ""friend"" for a phone number or address where you can call spontaneously. Marrieds have to worry about spouses or children intercepting the call/visit. This will put most marrieds off quickly. As well, phone numbers and addresses are easily reverse engineered. Modern people finding sites can tell you if a 50 year old John Doe has ever resided at that address in their lives! If someone lives in Denver, Colorado, why do you need a country code for an African nation?

, This may include using pet names (e.g. hon, love, babe, sweetie, etc.) immediately, or discussing marriage after a few IM chats. They may also claim that destiny, fate, or God brought you guys together and that they can't live without you. Most of this is all things to lure you in.

, They often claim they are in the hospital and the doctor will not perform the operation they need until you send them money. They could also say that they're so in love that they need to see you, but they need money to come visit you.

Seek out a smile and a shape.,
Have a friend or relative be with you at the meeting location so that they can get a read on him or her.,
Tell the relative or friend to take a photo of you and the date before you go out just in case something happens to you and also have them take down the license plate discreetly.,
Discuss what you and the date will be wearing before you meet and have him or her bring flowers so that you can easily see this person from a distance.,
Consider using online social networking sites to find dates.,
Talk to your potential date about their last relationships.,
Avoid potential dates whose dating profile lists very specific characteristics.,
Watch out for men (or women) with extreme road rage.",How to Avoid a Bad Date from the Internet," Some men will avoid smiling to cover their ugly teeth and they will not stand in a photo or they will have someone take it far away so you can't see their ugly body shape or how short they are.;
, Discuss a code beforehand that you and the relative will use if you want to go out with him or her and one that you will use if you want them to help you get out of the date.

, Any other information about your date should be given to the relative or friend. If you don't have relatives or friends nearby, then be sure to leave your date's information on a nightstand by your bed or in an area of your living room where everyone can see it, if you should go missing. If you don't want to meet them in person right away, then have someone check them out before you meet them.

, This is a good way to find out if they lied about their appearance before you met them, if they did, then they deserve to be kept waiting and you just saved yourself some future heartache. Who wants to date a liar anyway?

, This is a site where you meet to go dancing specifically.

, Ask questions like, ""How did that relationship end?"" The way someone talks about their prior relationships will tell you a LOT about them.

, These folks are looking for ""Dream Date"" and they're more interested in physicality than personality.

, This can be a sign of more severe problems.

, What is the level of service they will give you? Is it just a rewrite of your current profile or will they manage everything from choosing your avatar, selecting a flattering photo, interview you to find our more about you, help you choose a site, and then assist with managing replies to your profile?

, How knowledgeable are they about the huge range of sites out there? Do they offer any tips and suggestions for starting conversations or where to go on the first date? Can they help your spot a scam on a dating site?

Don't use Chatroulette if you're under 18 or offended by graphic material.",How to Use Chatroulette," Chatroulette is a video-based chat service, so you won't be able to get much use out of it without the right gear and accessories. Make sure that your computer has a working webcam, that the latest version of Flash is installed on your computer, and that your speakers are working.


If you'd like to talk, make sure your microphone is working, as well. This isn't essential, as text chat is also possible.;
, At first, Chatroulette allowed absolutely anyone at all to use the site anonymously. However, to curtail malicious misuse, Chatroulette now requires users to sign up with a free account before using the site's features. Making an account requires choosing a username and specifying an email address and password for the account to be associated with.


To make an account, visit www.chatroulette.com (don't worry, you won't be exposed to anything graphic yet). Click the ""Start"" button in the top left of the window and you'll receive a pop-up prompting you to create an account.

, On the main Chatroulette screen, you should see two black squares on the left side of the screen. When you use Chatroulette, the bottom square will display your webcam feed, while the top square will display your partner's. Click the ""Preview your webcam"" button on the bottom square to activate your computer's webcam. If it is functioning correctly, you should see whatever is in front of its lens. Usually, this is your own gorgeous face!


When you preview your webcam you may receive a pop-up prompt asking for your permission to activate the webcam. In this case, simply click ""Ok"" or ""Accept"" or the equivalent option to turn your webcam on.

, When you've created an account and gotten your camera working, you're ready to spin the Chatroulette wheel! If you're not already there, visit www.chatroulette.com. When your mind is prepared and your nerves are steeled, click the ""Start"" button in the top left. Your mic and camera should activate and you'll enter into a chat session with a random user from anywhere in the world. Have fun!

, After you click the ""Start"" button, the text on the button will change to ""Next"". This button now allows you to instantly end video chat with the current user and switch to another random user. If you're sheepish, you may want to keep your mouse hovering over this button so that you can quickly skip over any offensive content.


Additionally, the ""Stop"" button in the upper left will immediately cut your video feed without reconnecting you to another user. As you can imagine, this button is useful when you'd like to stop the feed entirely.
Finally, if you come across offensive or exploitative content, click ""Report and next"". If a certain user is reported often enough within a certain amount of time, s/he will be temporarily blocked.

, Unfortunately, the internet is full of scammers, schemers, and creeps, and Chatroulette is no exception. Take stock of your surroundings - is there anything visible in your camera's field of vision that can identify you? If so, conceal these items or remove them entirely. Below are just a few of the types of things that can be used to identify you:


Your real name
Your address
Financial information
Birthmarks/tattoos

, It's easy to forget when you're hunched over a laptop screen at 3 o'clock in the morning that your partner can see you, too. Before going onto Chatroulette, you may want to take a moment to ensure that you and the area around you is looking as nice as possible. Style your hair, wash your face, and remove any garbage from the surrounding area to avoid harassment at the hands of a merciless stranger.


If you have different lighting options available, you may want to opt for a soft, warm light source, as, if you're like most people, you won't look your best in the harsh pale glow of a monitor.

, Despite its bad apples, Chatroulette is an incredible tool. If used correctly, Chatroulette allows you to strike a genuine connection with someone from another part of the globe that you would never have met otherwise. Make the most of this opportunity! Behave on Chatroulette as you would if you were actually meeting someone from another part of the world - be polite, friendly, and open-minded. Common sense will get you far!


Chatroulette does have a few rules for its use. These are displayed on the main Chatroulette page before you begin chatting and are:

Users cannot broadcast nudity or offer to do so
Users must be 18 or over
Users cannot broadcast spam (advertisements)
Users cannot fake the video stream of another person



, This is where the true fun lies in Chatroulette! Take advantage of the Chatroulette's randomness, world-wide reach, and relative anonymity to surprise and/or amuse a stranger! You may, for instance, want to prank unsuspecting partners by having a friend suddenly pop in front of the camera. Or, you may want to plan a hilarious lip synched song-and-dance performance. Your imagination and Chatroulette's rules for use are the only limits!

, This cannot be stated enough - Chatroulette is no place for children or the faint-of-heart. Though the majority of Chatroulette users are normal, everyday people, a significant minority are pranksters or perverts, many of whom are bold, brazen and malicious. A study published early in the site's run found that about 1 in 8 ""spins"" connected the user to ""R-rated"" content.Though recent efforts to curtail this misuse have had major success, it is still not entirely rare to encounter graphic content on Chatroulette.


Seriously, don't use Chatroulette if you're a kid and don't let your kids use Chatroulette if you're a parent. It's easy to see something truly horrible on Chatroulette. You've been warned!

Make sure you want to date online.,
Keep the profile simple.,
Understand that looks can be deceiving.,
Read between the lines.,
Don't get easily tricked.,
Talk about interesting things.,
Wear a watch.",How to Avoid an Online Dating Disaster (for Women),";
, Online dating allows you to write down exactly what you want. However, don’t get too carried away and write 10 pages of what you’re looking for. Not only will your ad be really specific in what is and is not acceptable, but you will sound horrifically shallow.

, Sometimes guys can send you pictures that have been taken years before, or they’ll send you one of the thousand where they look “normal.” Many guys with advanced computer skills embellish their images, making double chins vanish and muscles more defined. Even worse is a picture that isn’t even them to begin with.

, If the person you're thinking about has nothing to show but his rock hard abs, there is something wrong with him. If you see nothing but their rock hard abs, there is something wrong with you. If you agree to meet them without any knowledge of who they are, you’re only setting yourself up for disappointment.

, If you do, don’t run away or make some horrid excuse to leave. Be nice, stay and chat.

, If your date doesn't, you have every reason to leave because the more he begins to rant on about his inadequacies, the more you will begin to hate yourself for staying.

, It’s not just just an accessory to match your outfit, but it’s your get out of jail free card. When problems arise, you can use your watch to your advantage. Rather than being rude and checking your cell phone, you can casually check the time on your watch, and politely tell them when it's ""time to go."" Steve will be just another person you can file into your Rolodex of bad dating experiences, while your watch will continue to be by your side. Your watch: Your wingman. Your fashion statement. Your timepiece. So when you leave the house, don’t forget it.

Cross-platform


Chatzilla is available as an extension to SeaMonkey and Mozilla's popular Firefox browser.

Mibbit is a web based Ajax IRC client.

Opera includes a built-in IRC client.

Pidgin is a multi-platform instant messaging client which supports IRC, as well as AIM, Yahoo, Facebook and several other protocols.

Smuxi is an irssi-inspired, flexible, user-friendly and cross-platform IRC client for advanced users, targeting the GNOME desktop.
Several terminal based IRC clients exist; popular ones include WeeChat and irssi. These two in particular are very feature rich and highly extensible - especially the former. Note that these are usually made for Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and OS X.
There are numerous web clients that can be used to access IRC. These are often found on the website of the organization that has an IRC room or channel. These will usually limit you to access to a particular channel or network.

HexChat is the successor to the most popular Linux client for IRC XChat. It can probably be found in the software repository of your Linux distribution of choice. Unlike XChat before it, HexChat is completely open source software and free of charge on all platforms.


For Windows


mIRC is the most popular IRC client available for Windows due to it being so easily modifiable. It is known as shareware and you are granted a 30 day license in which to try the software, after which you may still use the software, but are given a message asking that you register it for a fee of $20.
Whilst mIRC is the most popular, there are a number of other free IRC clients available: ClicksAndWhistles, IceChat and many of the platform-independent IRC clients mentioned above.


For Linux


SourceForge hosts many IRC clients for Linux

This blurb also includes the terms of use that you will find on most IRC networks.

, IRC networks can contain numerous rooms, or channels, which are used to hone conversation, because there will often be one channel for a particular topic of conversation. You can join any of these quite easily, if they aren't password protected. First, however, you might need to find a channel to join; and this can be accomplished by using a common function of your client that lists all of the channels on the server. To do this varies from client-to-client.

, If you truly can't find one, most servers have a help channel (#help) where you can, of course, ask.

Consider installing a client script.,
Consider a pre-existing codebase for your bot.,
Consider writing your own bot.",How to Develop an IRC Bot1," Sometimes you just want a simple task done and don't want it to be an independent program. In that case, you can attach a script to an IRC client. This is pretty common to do with mIRC, which has a robust scripting engine and a wide variety of available scripts. This is the easiest option and highly recommended if you don't have much or any programming experience. For the rest of this guide, the instructions require some knowledge of computer programming to follow.
, There exist many open source and free programs that can help you set up your own customized bot quickly. One such example is Eggdrop, the oldest IRC bot still being maintained. PHP-IRC is also a popular library to use. Although it is no longer being maintained, it should still work well., For advanced IRC users and developers who already know their way around a programming language, this is a great option. You can use pretty much any language you want as long as it has socket support, but popular ones to use include Python, Lua, PHP, C, and Perl. If you don't know any of these but you do know another language, that's not a problem. You can usually find examples on the web in any language you want. For this article, we'll demonstrate using PHP. To use PHP, you'll need to have PHP-CLI installed on your computer or server.

PHP can be downloaded from php.net

PHP scripts can be executed from the command line. For additional information and help using PHP, see this PHP manual page.

Gather the connection details.,
Initialize the configuration in your script.,
Connect to the network.,
Register your bot.,
Keep fetching data from the socket using a loop.,
Write a ping handler.,
Join your channels.,
Respond to channel messages.,
Extend your bot.",How to Develop an IRC Bot2," You'll need to get the following information in order to connect successfully to the network.


Server: The domain name of the server used to connect to IRC, such as chat.freenode.net


Port: In most cases, this is 6667, but if you're not sure, check your own IRC client or the network's website.

Nickname: The nickname your bot should use. Keep in mind some special characters are usually not allowed (@#!~).

Ident: The ident field appears after the nickname when someone performs a WHOIS like this: nickname!ident@hostname


GECOS: This field typically holds a user's real name or a general description of the bot but you can put whatever you want in there.

Channel: You usually want your bot to be present in one or more channels. On most networks, these are prefixed with '#' but it might be something else.

, The most basic way to do this is by naming a few variables according to the configuration names above. You could also store them in a config file and parse them out, but for right now we'll just stick with the absolute necessities.

, To do this, you'll need to open a socket to the server on the specified port. You should also add some error handling code in this part in case the connection fails for whatever reason. In this case, PHP provides us some neat functions to handle the error effectively.

, This means supplying your nickname, ident, and GECOS to the server, not registering with NickServ. To do this, just write the NICK and USER commands to the server, followed by a carriage return and newline. It is imperative that you do it exactly as shown, because that is how it is specified in RFC1459, the specification for the IRC protocol. Note that the middle two parameters (in this case, * and 8) must be specified, but they are ignored by the server. Those two are only used between linked servers, not by a directly connecting client.

, If you didn't use a loop, your script would immediately terminate and the bot would be basically useless. In order to stay connected, you have to fetch data from the server, check for any input in the stream you want, and respond to it if so. Here, we're grabbing data using socket_read() to grab any data available for us. If there is, we keep on doing whatever's in the loop. It might be helpful to also output the raw data to the console so you can see what's going on from the bot's perspective.

, This is important. If you don't respond to pings in a timely manner, the server will disconnect you. Let's take care of that first. Pings look like this when sent from the server: PING :rajaniemi.freenode.net. The server doesn't have to put its name after the ':', it can supply whatever it wants. You *must* repeat back exactly what the server said, except using PONG.

, Okay, so we have a bot that connects to the network and responds to pings, but otherwise does nothing. For people to see and use your bot, it should be in a channel (otherwise you'd have to tell it to respond to private messages).


To do this, we'll check for server status codes 376 or 422. 376 means the MOTD (message of the day) finished. 422 means there wasn't any MOTD to send. That MOTD is just something the server sends when you connect, but it is a good indicator for when we can start joining channels.
You'll need to issue a JOIN command. This command can be followed by one or more channels separated by a comma.
Notice that the data the server sends is conveniently delimited by spaces. This way we can split the data and reference it using an array index.

, Now for the fun part. Your bot's joined the channel, so now you can use it for what you wanted to. Let's create an example command called @moo.


Note the offset where messages begin (this applies to both channels and private messages). It is always in the same place.
You can handle commands with spaces in them by splicing the chunked data back together ($d). That's beyond the scope of this article.
If the target is a channel (such as #botters-test), then you reply to that. If it's a private message, this bit will be your bot's nickname! You must then reply using the sender's nickname, not yours (otherwise you'd be talking to yourself, and that's just silly).

, You can add many new features using the above implementation. There are many other commands that can be issued to the IRC network, such as managing ops, kicking and banning, setting the topic, among many other features."

Keep safe.,
Enjoy your chat time.",How to Behave in Internet Chat Rooms," Whether you are interested in unusual pets, horoscopes or classic music there is likely to be a chat room, discussion board or forum that caters for you. Have a search to find one you like the look of.;
, The site will most likely have a rules or frequently asked questions page, read them carefully. Many sites are very specific about what is allowed and what isn't, and you don't want to start off on the wrong foot.

, To join the site you will need to input a User name. It's not necessary for this to be your real name - use any you like. Many websites also like you to create a profile, this gives you a chance to let the other Users know a little about you - however it's not the place to enter any personal details, not even your surname. Your town is as specific as you need to be.

, Before you post a message, or jump into the conversation, 'lurk' a little. Get a feel for the topic being discussed and the tone being used. This also stops you from repeating another User's posting.

, When you are ready to post a message keep it to the same topic and be concise. No one will read a long involved block of text. On the same note, don't waste peoples time by posting gibberish or by repeating yourself, this will make you very unpopular.


If you are making a specific comment about an earlier message, include that part of the message as a quote with your response below.







, Dominating the conversation is a no no, as is making rude comments. If you wouldn't do it in real life, don't do it on the internet.

, Although the internet is less formal than other forms of written communication the same grammatical rules apply.


The only exception may be the use of acronyms such as BTW - 'by the way', LOL - 'laugh out loud' or FYI - 'for your information'. These acronyms change and develop all the time, so keep up with the zeitgeist.






Never type in capitals, as it looks like you are shouting, which is rude.






Avoid using excessive punctuation. You may think it emphasizes your point but it can make your comments appear sarcastic, or even condescending.






Read your message before you post it to make sure the meaning is clear, and to check for any mistakes.







, Online communication lacks the tone and body language that we use to express ourselves in face to face conversations. Therefore the use of smilies, or emoticons, are often applied to clarify the meaning of a posting. There are thousands of variations of these, if you are not sure of a particular smilies meaning have a quick internet search. Use these sparingly, a posting littered with smilies can make it difficult to read.

, All web chat rooms, forums and message boards have a moderator. Report any abusive messages to them. If you are the one posting the offending message the moderator may well eject you from the site.

, Don't give out any personal details - this includes your address, phone number, bank details, full name, passwords or work place. Be suspicious of people who ask to meet you in person. There is no guarantee that they have been honest about who they really are.

, Approach it with a good sense of humour, a desire to make and maintain friendships and to discuss topics actively and calmly.

, That is no porn and no rude jokes or comments. That will get you instantly banned from the channel.

, As most IRC channels will give you a warning or you could just be kicked and banned from the channel without warning. But some IRC channels may not be as strict as others about this. Play it safe and do not do it.

, And if you are on a Linux channel do not talk about Windows. As many channels may mistake this for trolling and that will get you banned. This applies even more if you are criticizing the other operating system.

, As you don't know the members very well and a lot of people don't like this. And may get offended by it. And you could end up getting a warning from a channel bot or human op. And it will also make you unpopular and you do not want to get on the wrong side of people.

, That is do not type lines and lines of text in your conversation or many sentences. As many IRC channels forbid this. If you are having a conversation with other members on IRC, it is best to type very short sentences. If you have to paste, use a pastebin.

, That is if you are a Windows XP user do not say ""I hate Windows Vista."" As many people take this the wrong way on IRC chat. Even if you do feel this way save it for the forums, not the IRC channel.

, Do not get into an argument as you will only end up being banned from the channel. Also if someone is rude to you, do not respond back, as this will also get you banned. Moderators do not care who started the argument. So if someone is rude to you, just ignore them. Would you do the same if someone in a bar challenged you to a fight? If not, don't do the same here!

2 stars - Poor
3 stars - Average
4 stars - Very Good
5 stars - Excellent

, The title should concisely describe your trip, and you may want to add information such as what you thought of the place you traveled to/visited, and the specific things that were good or bad. For example, instead of writing ""Awful Trip!!!"" try writing ""The Trip Was Awful - Rude Service and Compromised Sleep Quality."" Other travelers reading your review will understand your opinion better if you write a concise and specific title of your review, rather than just writing something such as ""Awful Trip"" and ""Very, Very Good""' about the place you visited.

, Start by including information about who you traveled with and what you traveled for. Then you can get to the information about your actual trip and the quality of things, such as the value for money and what you thought of the service. You can also provide a little background information, such as what you thought of the rooms if you are reviewing a hotel or vacation rental, your opinion on the rides/things you got to see or do if you are reviewing an attraction, and what you ordered if you're reviewing a restaurant. You want to provide information about what you did at the place you visited, as this is one thing that travelers want to know.


Try not to provide too much background information. Your readers want to know about the actual trip as well.


, You might have traveled with family, on a business trip, or just traveled solo to get time to yourself. You can tell readers what your trip is for by choosing one of the options under ""What sort of trip was this?"" The options are as follows: ""Business,"" ""Couples,"" ""Family,"" ""Friends"" and ""Solo.""

, One thing your readers want to know is the time and date when you took your trip. You can inform them about this by clicking the selection bar to select the recent month when you traveled.

, Rating other aspects of your trip will tell your readers what you thought of each aspect (value, cleanliness, service, etc.) You can do this by clicking on the circles for each option under ""Could you say a little more about it? (optional).""

, If you want to preview your review, click on ""Preview your review.""


Remember to check the box that confirms that you understand that TripAdvisor has a zero-tolerance policy for fake reviews.

Listen.,
Be respectful.

,
Don't have side conversations.,
Realize why you are banned.,
Don't evade an IRC ban.,
Don't even bother arguing against your ban if you know you are wrong.,
Be friends with an OP.,
Repent and take care never to repeat whatever action got you banned in the first place.,
Don't push it.",How to Behave on IRC," When you first enter the chat room, listen for a few minutes to figure out what people are talking about. Feel free to join in, but don't push your topic. Wait for it to come up naturally.

,, If you are just talking with one other person, that could be annoying to the other members of the chat room. Take those conversations to email, Facebook, Twitter, another social networking site, or even text.

, You may already know what you have done, so think about whether your choice was a good or bad one. Remember, you're the one who is responsible for your actions.;
, Take the punishment into account, and respect the operator's decision. Avoid logging in with another account, period. You may be banned from the channel forever just for doing this once. If you want to know exactly what you did wrong, try messaging one of the operators. Don't bother network staff unless they are also ops for the particular channel (listed by name on access list), they won't deal with you. Preferably message the op that banned you, although if they are abusive feel free to at least report their misconduct to another.

, If you don't understand, follow the previous step. You will obviously lose and be permanently or if lucky long term banned if you argue with an operator or physically threaten to harm them. This can even include an implicit threat such as saying you'd like them to suffer. This is also the crime of a malicious communication / harassment if done repeatedly in some countries e.g. the UK so don't even consider it especially in these countries!

,


If you are an enemy with the ops in a channel, you most likely will not get unbanned. If you are friends with an op, on the other hand, you may get unbanned from the channel. You can easily make friends with an op by being respectful of their decisions, being kind to them, and being on your best behavior.

,


Promise that you will never do the action again, and ask for forgiveness. You will be untrusted and banned again, quite possibly permanently, if you do it another time.

,


If the ban stays, or you get yelled at for asking for mercy, then let it go and don't ever go back. It's not worth the ire of the IRC operators you may get from harassing the OP's.

These are things to look out for; you don't want to date or hook up with someone who carries negative energy or unresolved baggage–they could impose it on you!, If you're wary of appearing desperate after ""liking"" a guy on OkCupid, give it a day before you message him. Test the waters by crafting a message with a few lines. Ask what his hobbies are or where he likes to go in the city. Stand out from other suitors by responding to something from his dating profile. Point out your shared love or distaste for animals or grilled cheese. Ask what he thinks of a certain movie from the genre he likes. Ask him about his hometown, places he's travelled, books or TV shows he's been watching. If he's interested in you he should respond with a longer chunk of text and some questions about you. If answers seem generic and messaging slows down to responses every several days, it's probably time to move on to another online interest., By now you should be messaging back and forth with a day or less in between messages, and you're still interested to see him. It's time to plan an IRL (in real life) meeting! Depending on your personality, you can ask him directly. For example:


""Do you want to talk about this more over a beer?""
""What are you up to this weekend? Wanna get brunch?""
""Want to crash the mall like Avril Lavigne in Complicated?""
""I've been dying to see this movie, wanna see it and get dinner after?""
If you really prefer him to make the first move, mention the idea of getting together in passing and see how he responds. ""I love eating breakfast at any time of the day!"" or ""I'd be down to see a Cubs game any day!"" (Make sure you really mean it.)

, Sometimes a guy needs time to read your profile and also figure out whether you two would get along. Other times, a guy is too underdeveloped for online dating and just won't respond. There isn't much you can do at this point, but don't pester him for an answer., Arrange to meet up, hang out or whatever you decide to call it. Ask him tons of questions about him and try to comment on the music or decor of the venue if there's nothing to talk about.

, It's a polite thing to do and people appreciate knowing whether or not the other party is still interested. Still interested in him? Say you had a good time and mention some kind of in-joke you had established during the meeting.


Texting hopefully leads to chatting and soon the planning of another date...! If there really wasn't chemistry, say it was great to meet and that you ""just don't feel a connection"". This way, everyone leaves on the same page and his online dating experience would be a lot less offhanded.

Be prepared for rejection.",How to Ask a Guy Out Online (for Straight Women)2,"  Your friend should be a pretty good judge of character and know if he's already dating someone. From there you can ask them to set up a hangout for all of you. This way your attempt to meet him won't be obvious or creepy.

, If you feel daring, send him a message along with a friend request saying ""Hey, just thought I'd say hi as I notice we have a lot of mutual friends."", Or send him a message a week later asking if he'd like to hang out or join in on some gathering with your friends. Throw tons of eye contact or look at him when he seems unaware of you doing that. That should tickle his interest., If you're at a hangout with lots of friends, sit next to him and try to have a one-on-one conversation. Otherwise, show your interest by asking if you can buy him a drink or make him one if you're at a house party. Ask him how you know your friends to ease him into conversation about what he does and things he likes., Send him a two-liner saying it was great to see him and ask if he would like to get coffee or lunch sometime. Keep it casual. If rapport between the two of you is already flirtatious, you can set the tone by saying ""Great! It's a date ;)""

, If he's a mature and caring person, he would directly tell you he's not interested. If he doesn't ever respond, assume it's a ""no"". It's inconsiderate of someone to avoid responding to questions they are afraid to answer, and you shouldn't waste any time waiting on his interest. Commend yourself yourself for taking the leap!

On the other hand, if he says he's ""busy"" or ""maybe"" without an explanation, take it as a cue that he's letting you off nicely. The ball is in his court, after all. He'll reach out if he wants to hang out some other time. Remember, a rejection would be much better than an insincere date!

Sign up for an online dating service.,
Make your dating profile honest.,
Use a flattering profile picture.,
Keep some mystery.",How to Flirt Online," If you want someone to talk to you, you need to have something to talk about. Whether you know the person in ""real"" life or just from a dating profile page, it's impossible to find a connection if all you've got to say is ""hey"" or ""ur cute.""


Don't start conversations with, ""hey"" or ""what up."" It doesn't give you anywhere to go. Start with an interesting question or an observation, or a comment. Even if it's small, start with, ""Whoa, whoa-whoa. There's no way I can't ask you about your new profile picture. Is that a waterfall? Please dish.""
Don't start with a line. Innuendo or crude jokes aren't the way to get someone interested. Read the next section for more specific advice for picking conversation topics.;
, People like talking when it's easy. If you want to have a fun, flirty conversation, make it easy for the other person to have it by asking them questions and being a good ""listener"" to their responses.


Ask lots of follow-up questions. If the waterfall profile picture was in Cancun last summer, ask about the trip. How was it? What was the most ridiculous thing you saw there? Worst thing you ate?
Don't pry. Asking questions like, ""That sounds so fun! I'd be scared to try sky-diving. How was it?"" is one thing. But the answer to ""How can you afford to sky-dive when you work in the service industry?"" isn't any of your business.

, It's hard to define flirting exactly. Lots of people just want to look for a connection, some kind of electricity. Often, this has to do with your sense of humor and your playfulness. Let your sense of humor come through. If you think it's funny to reference obscure Wu-Tang Clan songs, or random facts while you're talking, then do it. Be yourself. If someone doesn't think that's funny, they're better off with someone else.


Sometimes, gentle teasing can be flirty and electric, or it can make you come off like a jerk. It might be funny to one person to say, ""Whoa nice waterfall picture. That looks cold. Plus those plants are wack. Nice try though."" To others, not so much.

, Flirting needs someone to be at the other end of the line or it won't spark. Respond to as many messages as you can when you see them, and show the other person that you enjoy the exchange between the two of you.


""Leaving them waiting"" is the rallying cry of people with no dates. If you want to chat online, be there to chat. If you want to ignore people's messages, go do something else.
If someone else isn't talking to you, leave them alone. There's no sense in peppering them with a million interesting and well-formed questions that they're going to respond ""lol"" to.

, The best flirtatious conversations end with the other person wanting more. You want to leave them thinking about you, and wishing that you'd log back on for more chatting. Before the conversation runs out of steam, it's a good idea to cut it short and leave them thinking about you.


Look for a high note that might be difficult to top. If you get someone really laughing, but can't think of anywhere to go beyond that, just end the conversation: ""Good talking to you. Gotta feed the dog, though. He's about to eat me.""

, Invest some effort into flirting, but don't expect a lot of return initially until you ""click"" with the right person. If you can't start a conversation with someone, you can't start a conversation. Flirt around. Have fun. Have lots of conversations, and keep them light.


On the other hand, don't give up too easily. Online chats can take some time to get to know someone. As mentioned earlier, keep it lighthearted and stay approachable.

, If you want to flirt and find a genuine connection with someone, it's important to be yourself, not the self-promoting Facebook version of yourself. It's all too easy to come off as conceited online, the more you talk about yourself and your accomplishments. So don't. Just be you.


Write the same way you talk. You don't need to make yourself ""sound smart"" or try to use words you wouldn't normally use to flirt. It'll come off as fake and awkward.On the other hand, self-deprecating humor can sometimes be funny, but it can also sometimes come off as desperate or annoying. It's good to talk about yourself in positive ways.

, Flirting is just like having a regular conversation, but more fun. Go into expecting that you're going to laugh and you're going to have a good time, not like you're going to get a date with someone, or make them fall in love with you. That's too weird. Just chat like you would with a new friend.Take advantage of the Internet as a resource. Just read a funny article or saw a funny .gif or a cute video? Pass it on. Something to share and talk about.Different people like to talk about different things. To one person, it might be flirty to tell long stories and talk about serious subjects, while to another it might be dull. To one person, it might be flirty to talk about partying, while to others it could be a turn-off. Read each person and adjust.

, Online flirting is a marathon, not a sprint. There's no reason to rush right into talking about what you want, or planning a date, or figuring out where you're going to move in with all the children you're going to have. Whoa there. Just focus on having a few laughs and seeing if you like someone.


Don't go right for the crude sexual references. Some innuendo can be flirty with the right person, but only once you've gotten to know someone. If if feels pornographic, it's not flirting.
Avoid blurting out ""I love you"" on the basis of five minutes of chat and one profile photo. That will be an immediate relationship killer. It's okay to tell the other person that you think they're lovely, fascinating and gorgeous, but leave out love language until you both seem to know each other quite a lot better. If you wouldn't say it flirting in real life, don't say it online.

, If you're in class with someone you're chatting with, talk about class. If you're in the same town, talk about what neighborhoods you like. Talk about the best hang-outs. Talk about something that you have in common with each other to help make a connection.


If you don't have anything in common, or can't figure out what you've got in common, ask questions until you find something. Even if the questions are silly, like, ""What's the best month and why?"" or ""What's your sign?"" you'll be able to start talking about something.

, Everybody you talk to online has been fed the same lines at some point, and been asked the same dull questions. ""What do you like to do for fun?"" and ""What are your hobbies?"" are sort of dull flirtation questions. But, if you tell a story about how your neighbors are fighting about how the one's dog peed on the other's stoop, you'll have something funny to jump off from. ""What do you think of dogs? And ridiculous neighbors?""


Don't ramble about your own life too much. Talking about your whole history and backstory is a good way to make someone think you're self-obsessed. Share smart details.

, Someone doesn't need all the intimate details of your entire life story, your problems, and your innermost thoughts and desires. Save it for later. That's not flirting, it's blurting.


Don't be a sad-sack if you're trying to flirt. If you've been striking out a lot lately, it won't sound flirtatious to say so. It'll sound desperate.
Be very, very careful about talking about serious things like marriage, monogamy and having children, especially if you don't know the person. These are all flirt-killing words. Wait until you're in person to talk about these things.

, If you really can't think of anything to talk about, but really want to be flirtatious, you can always just start playing the random question game and talking about silly things. Talk about your best meals, your favorite animals, whether or not Katy Perry's a genius or more boring than white toast. Good silly questions or prompts to show your funny side:


""Tell me the story of the best sandwich you ever ate.""
""Which member of the Wu-Tang Clan or One Direction or the Beatles best represents you as a person?""
""If you could go to any country, what would it be?""
""What's better, naps or hot-tubs? Or Netflix? Or...hiking? I say hiking, I'm not lazy I swear. Go on, I'm sorry.""

, Good compliments can be a way to get the door open and have more to talk about. Pick something that you like about the person, or have noticed, and use it as a compliment, then turn that compliment into something you can talk about.


Compliments are nice, but they're also hard to respond to. Try to turn it into a conversation: ""That picture of you at the waterfall is so pretty! You look great. What happened that day?""
One compliment per conversation is appropriate. If you start to seem overly complimentary, it can seem obsessive or creepy. If you think someone is attractive, that's nice to hear, but it's not necessary to say five times every minute.

, Online dating is increasingly common and almost necessary, especially in bigger cities. It's just the way people meet nowadays. If you want to flirt online and meet exciting people, start a profile on a dating service and start reaching out. It's a good way to get in touch and flirt online. The most popular and common dating sites are:


Match
OkCupid
Tinder
MeetUp
Plenty of Fish
eHarmony

, If you want to connect with someone, fill out your profile information honestly and in a flattering way. Make yourself sound like the kind of person you are, to attract like-minded people.


Don't be basic and boring. Every other profile has the phrases, ""Living life to the fullest"" and ""I just like to travel"" on it. Be honest and find something interesting to say.
Think carefully about how you summarize yourself in the profile. Pull out the most distinctive, interesting and true things about yourself to put out there for all to read.
Honest doesn't mean desperate. If you haven't been on a date in 20 years, it's not necessary to broadcast it for attention.

, A connection is more important than looks, it's true. But when you're flirting with someone online, good looking photos of your face and clothed body are still important. If you can't take lovely shots of yourself, have a friend or professional take a few that capture you in your best light.


Be yourself. Don't try to be the tough, scantily clad, or bizarre version of yourself in your photo. Show yourself as a genuine, regular and likable human being with a photo that shows you at your best.
No nudes and no drunk pics. Not a good idea.

, There's no reason to over-sell yourself. Keep some privacy, even though you're dating online. Spend a lot of time getting to know someone before giving out intimate details and even then, make the first meetings very public ones. Once you stick to this rule, the rest of your online flirting is about having fun.


Having someone who seemed nice at first but turns really weird holding your phone number or address is plain creepy, if not downright frightening.
Avoid any temptation to post hundreds of photos of yourself for people to check out. Anyone you're flirting with will start to think that you're vain.

Pay attention.,
Take a look at the picture that the person is using on the profile.,
See if the internet can verify that this person is real.,
Forget about pursuing the relationship if you're asked for money.,
Just stay away if there are any signs of scams.,
Really listen to the questions they ask of you.,
Consider the speed with which the other person professes to love/want/need/desire you.,
Keep personal data to yourself.,
Consider keeping your online dating local.,
Plan a meetup.,
There is a local meetup scam.",How to Avoid Internet Dating Scams," When you start talking to someone on the internet, pay particular attention to the messages that they are sending. Are the messages answering the questions that you are asking or are they just generic messages that could be sent to anyone with just one minor change for each – the name? Prolific romance scam artists will generally use the same messages for everyone that they are trying to lure in as victims so if the messages are too general for your liking, back away as fast as you can. They are so generic that you can often find much of what they write by searching on Google. Even on profiles, the text can be copied and pasted from that found on other dating sites.


Consider the language the person is using. Poor English can be a red flag signal for you to at least be more circumspect until you know more about this person. Many of the scam artists come from countries where English isn't the first language and their command of it in writing is poor; bad grammar and spelling can be an indicator that the person may not be genuine.They also may get different forms of English mixed up. For example, would an American man write about having a great sense of 'humour' (with an extra 'u')? Would a British woman call her mother 'my Mom' instead of 'my Mum'? And how many native English speakers would say 'am John/Jane by name' instead of 'my name is John/Jane'? Or describe themselves as 'God fearing?' This isn't to say that you won't find love with someone who speaks another language. Of course, this ""sign"" is contextual, as many people can't be bothered spelling properly and if you fall in love with someone from China, your Chinese may be as iffy as their English. It's just one thing to be wary about.
Are messages/emails even addressed to you? If the scam is generic, even your name might get messed up in the general entrapment process. Look for the wrong name, misspellings of your name or other personal things that a person falling in love ought to get right, repetition and things that sound vague. Also be wary of anything that reads like a news or magazine story––it probably is.;
, Does this person look too good to be true? This might just be the case – the easiest way to lure in victims is to make yourself seem as attractive as possible so if the lady or man that you are talking to is in their 40’s but the picture shows a person barely 25, alarm bells should most definitely be ringing!


Has the person given you a photo or is there one on the profile? If so, use a facial recognition/photo recognition search engine such as Google's search by image or Tineye to see if it's one of a kind or one of many.Scam artists often pinch photos of people to make up a persona and a little digging can quickly reveal this. Even when the image has been cropped to hide a logo, or edited using Photoshop (to change the face) the original image still shows up. Photos of models, porn stars, soldiers and politicians are widely used, but even stolen photos of ordinary people also end up being used. Google search by image is highly effective for identifying photos used by scammers, especially when using the Chrome browser as you can just right click on the image and select 'Search Google for this image'.

, Do an online search for the person. What returns do you get? Do the things you read match up with their claims? For example, does their Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. account say what you expected?

If you are chatting with a John Smith or a Mary Brown, an online search will reveal many people. In this case, you'll need to be more search specific, using other things this person has told you about his or her life, such as place of work/study, town of residence and sports/hobby interests, etc. You may be able to confirm where they live by using an online telephone directory or electoral register depending on what country they say they are from.
Be wary of people, especially men, who say they're US military officers, especially if they use pictures of people in uniform on their profiles. Sometimes their photos are not of US officers at all - someone whose cap badge with a crown on it may be British, Australian or Canadian, but not American. And if they're outside the US, where are they serving? European countries like Switzerland and Ireland are neutral, so it's highly unlikely that serving US officers would be based there. Contact the Department of Defense, US military base or your nearest US Embassy.
Are they where they say they are? There are ways of being able to identify what country an email was sent from by tracing the IP address. For example, IP addresses beginning with '41' are in West Africa, a hotbed of scams. However, this may not be available, and in any case, they may tell you up front they are in that part of the world.
If they say they are in another country, treat with extreme caution anyone who is in West Africa. Scammers posing as men may say they are on business there, while those posing as women will say they are working in orphanages. Scammers in Nigeria or Ghana have started operating from other countries in the region, such as Benin, Togo or Senegal (although local people may also be involved) and have even got as far as Malaysia, from where they can target Singapore and Australia.
Learn about these countries and see how it matches what you're being told about them. There is no civil war in Zimbabwe. Nor is there a refugee camp in Dakar, Senegal full of attractive young black women who have escaped from civil war in Liberia or Zimbabwe, least of all the daughters of deceased politicians who have left them million-dollar legacies in bank accounts in Europe. It's a variation on the 419 scam. The woman in the photo doesn't know you, let alone love you enough to give you a share of an inheritance in return for you paying legal fees by Western Union.

, The standard reason someone asks for money online from someone they don't know is that they're out to scam you. This should immediately cause you to be concerned about the genuineness of the other person.


Don't get too involved in asking why the person wants the money. It's bad enough that he or she has asked you without giving space for elaborate and ultimately false reasons for needing it. (The more elaborate the story, the faster you should run.) A simple ""no"" should suffice; if it's meant to be, the budding relationship will survive your firm response!
Watch out for emails or messages that sound desperate, pleading and persistent in response to your unwillingness to send money. This isn't love, it's money hunger.

, Even if you manage to identify a scammer earlier rather than later, never confront them. Even if you're baiting them for fun, however tempting it may be to expose them and ridicule them for being so unconvincing, all they will do is change their email account, their photos, and their profiles, and carry on as before, possibly with more success. Just cease communicating with them, block their emails, and don't take their phone calls, just as you would a threatening or abusive ex-partner.

Share what information you have on a scammer, including photos used, email addresses, aliases, telephone numbers and text used in correspondence on websites exposing scammers. You may find the text has been used before, with a few changes, while photos of that person you thought you met on the dating site may have 'scammer' or 'stolen' superimposed.

, What kind of questions are you being asked? This is a common mistake made by so many but in reality, what does it matter what kind of money you earn or the value of your house? Of course, many scam artists will not be so obvious, but it can happen and does on a regular basis so if the conversation starts to steer towards finances, it might be time to close the account!


Be wary if the person you've just cyber-met asks probing questions to do with your finances, your personal life and the people you know. Tell the person you're uncomfortable giving away any such information to something you've yet to meet.

, Scam artists commonly try to shift the relationship into intimacy really quickly, because they want things to get moving (namely, your money and assets).Be extremely wary of anyone who tells you they love you and want to take things off the dating website to private IM, email, the phone, etc. within a very short time.


Unfortunately, this can be complicated. There are also scam artists who are quite willing to put in a long time cultivating a fake relationship with you until they feel they've gained your trust. This sort of person will likely reveal inauthentic intentions through such actions as pretending to book an airfare to meet you but canceling it or making up stories why the trip has to be postponed unless you can forward funds, telling you they've got a medical/family emergency and need money, etc., Until you meet this person for real, keep things superficial and pleasant. There is no need to passing on intimate details of your life and there is no way in the world this person you've yet to meet needs your social security or bank account numbers. Also, be aware that the more you reveal about yourself, the more leverage you give a scam artist to pinpoint a weak spot that they may try to manipulate you with.


Be aware that some scam artists use the ""intimate"" information to get back at you. They cajole, wheedle and stroke your ego to get the information, then they threaten you with revealing personal secrets unless you send money. You don't even have reassurance that they won't reveal what you've said even if you do pay! Bear this in mind before you let down your guard.

, It is much easier to be scammed when the person lives thousands of miles from you or is oceans away. Local people are more likely to be genuinely looking for connection and it'll be easier to verify their intent than with someone who lives far away. Moreover, scam artists like to hide behind distance., No matter how much you think you have in common with the potential partner you are talking to, remember that it is very easy to be a completely different person online than in real life. If you agree to meet up, do so during the day in a public place and if you are talking to a person from another country and they ask you to pay for their travel ticket or Visa – ask yourself why!


Ask to speak on the phone before meeting up. It is very easy to sound authentic when typing in words unemotionally but it's another thing to have to speak on the phone. Use your gut instincts when listening to them over the phone––your level of comfort is an important indicator.
If you communicate on Skype, make sure you get to see the person using video chat, and be wary of excuses about not having a webcam. In some cases scammers have actually used video footage of cam models, who are either silent or just say pleasantries like 'hello, how are you?' and then say there was a problem with their connection.
If the person sounds really enthusiastic about meeting you but pulls out every time you suggest that it happen, consider the relationship at an end. This person is playing you, whether it's for their own amusement, for scamming or whatever, and you deserve much better.

, Just before the first date the scammer will get 'cold feet' and ask that you verify who you are with a 'dating ID' site. Signup involves inputting your name, address and ... credit card details (which are tested)."

Remember that when creating your profile, less is more.,
Upload 2 to 5 flattering, but accurate pictures.,
Keep it real.",How to Avoid the Most Common Mistakes Men Make with Online Dating1," You want to stand out and be memorable without revealing too much. Keep your essays short, punchy, playful, and positive. Reveal enough personal detail to create a quick connection but not so much that you remove the mystery.;
, Resist the temptation to include out-of-date photos when you had 30 percent more hair and 20 percent fewer pounds. You should be smiling in at least one of your photos; unless you never smile in real life, 2-5 unsmiling photos will make you look uncharacteristically moody and sinister. Even if you've got a great 6-pack, don't go shirtless in any of your photos. Another bad idea, don't have an open shirt, plus unbuttoned pants to demo your ""attitude"", six-pack or designer underpants. Even if you look great in that photo with your ex, don't post a cutout of yourself with a phantom manicured hand on your shoulder. It is very worthwhile to have a good photographer friend or a professional take some nice shots of you.

, Some readers will check your profile for accuracy at an online dating review site. And every other member will just avoid a second date if you are not the man your profile presented you to be.

When messaging a potential date, say something friendly and thoughtful about her profile.,
Check your spelling and grammar.,
If she responds with questions about you, take the time to answer them.",How to Avoid the Most Common Mistakes Men Make with Online Dating2," Women on dating sites get dozens of messages a week from men saying nothing more than ""Hi, how are you, want to meet me?"" This creates the impression that many men are lazily sending the same message to as many women as possible, hoping to get a response from at least one of them, and trying to sound cool and nonchalant. This strategy backfires. You want to sound specifically interested in her, not desperate for a date with just anyone.

, It doesn't take long, and most people say that poor writing is an instant turn-off.

, Be friendly.

After an introduction, suggest meeting for coffee and a chat to see if you like each other.,
Choose the time and place if you're making the invite.,
Set your expectations low before the first date.,
Ask enough questions to keep the conversation flowing, but don't ask a long series of unrelated personal questions as if you are conducting an interview.,
Be relaxed during your date together.",How to Avoid the Most Common Mistakes Men Make with Online Dating3," Forget about emailing for months and getting all worked up over email. The longer you leave it before you meet, the less likely it is to happen. Ask for a coffee date in the first two weeks of emails. This will save you a lot of time and energy and disappointments. If the other person doesn’t agree to meet, move on and don’t worry about it. There are plenty more.

, People tend to respect decisive partners. So decide/suggest the cafe, time and date. If the person can’t make it when you suggest, reschedule within reason. The person will get the impression that you are not timid and are comfortable making decisions. This is good, although being pushy, demanding, or adamant is not the image you want to convey, either; find that comfortable median. If she suggests a time or location that is more convenient to her, be as accommodating as possible.

, By keeping your cool, you will stay on your game during the date, not complicate things with ""high"" expectations, and thereby avoid disappointment. The goal is to have fun and see if there's potential chemistry, not to get serious and find out ASAP if you've found your ultimate soul mate.

, Talk about yourself enough to let her get to know you, but don't brag about all your accomplishments or unload all your troubles.

, Don’t mention past partners or that you haven’t been dating for a long time. Just have some fun and enjoy.

Ask for assistance from household members.",How to Overcome Chatting Addiction," Oftentimes, you do not realize how much something is becoming a problem until you document it. Start keeping a journal about the time you spend online. Track how long you're on the internet each day, as well as how the time you spend online affects you emotionally.A journal can help keep you accountable. You'll be able to face how much time you spend chatting online if you track it. Get a small notebook and record when you get on the internet and when you get off the internet.
Tracking your internet time can also help you see how damaging chatting addiction is to your wellbeing. Record how you feel about being online all the time. You likely experience negative, guilty feelings about your chatting habits. If you face these feelings honestly, you'll be able to accept how damaging your addiction is. This can motivate you to quit.;
, Try to keep track of when and why you feel the urge to chat online. All addicts have certain triggers that cause them to pick up a bad habit. Spend about a week identifying the factors that push you towards online chatting.How are you feeling when you experience the urge to chat online? Do you feel lonely and bored? Restless? Anxious about something? A variety of emotions can encourage a person to chat compulsively.
For many people, internet use is a way of self soothing. If you're going through a rough time emotionally, or have an underlying disorder like depression, you may be more inclined to chat online. Try to keep in mind there are vastly healthier ways than the internet to deal with emotional issues.

, If online chatting is becoming a problem, you need to find healthier ways to cope. Find routes to channel your emotion that do not involve the internet.You may be chronically shy by nature, which can cause you to struggle with opening up to others. This can fuel loneliness, which results in excessive online chatting. Try to push yourself out of your comfort zone a little each day. Make plans with a work acquaintance. Make small talk with a barista at a coffee shop.
If you're feeling stressed, try to find a healthy activity instead of the internet. Exercise can help reduce stress, as can activities like yoga, deep breathing, and meditation.

, Addiction rarely happens without warning. If you have an online chatting addiction, try to figure out what underlying stressors may be fueling your need for constant online contact.Have you struggled with other addictions in the past? If you've had issues with drugs or alcohol, you may have developed an online chatting addiction to cope. Oftentimes, addicts replace one addiction with another.
You may also have an underlying mental illness. If you've struggled with depression, anxiety, or other troublesome issues in the past, this may be contributing to your chatting addiction.

, You are not alone. Many people struggle with some form of internet addiction. If you do not know someone who has a chatting addiction specifically, you may know someone who's addicted to their smart phone or something like Facebook. Reach out to others who struggle with some form of internet addiction for support.You can work with other addicts to hold one another accountable. You can all agree to get together for internet and smart phone free time.
Share progress with other addicts. You can all help each other be more accountable for your actions. For example, you can try to compete with one another in terms of taking computer breaks. Try offering a small prize for whoever can stay offline longest.

, Most people cannot quit chatting cold turkey. As you strive to get away from the internet, set small and reasonable goals for yourself.Try to schedule when you can go online. For example, set aside two hours in the early evening for internet chatting. Only go online for those hours and stay away from your computer or phone otherwise.
You may need some help at first. If you're an addict, it may be hard to cap your time at a certain number of hours. You can look into applications that can block websites during certain hours of the day. You can also have a family member help you power down your computer or laptop after a certain amount of time.

, You can make small changes to your home to make it harder for you to get online. For example, never take a smart phone or tablet to bed with you. Turn your computer or laptop off instead of putting it into sleep mode. Store your laptop in a hard-to-reach place when you're not using it. If it's out of site, it may be easier to forget about the urge to chat online., Exercise can help curb a variety of addictions and may be beneficial for chatting addiction. Aerobic exercise can help keep feelings of depression, which often fuel addiction, away. Exercise can also provide a distraction that will keep you off the internet.Schedule workout time a few times a week. Incorporate a workout into your routine the way you would incorporate something like brushing your teeth.
Pick a form of exercise you like, as you'll be more likely to stick to it. If you hate running, do not expect to do a nightly jog. Instead, try something you enjoy, like riding your bike or swimming.

, Internet addiction is sometimes driven by escapism. A good book can provide an alternative to talking to strangers online. Take out a library card, make a trip to your local bookstore, or browse titles online or on an electronic reader.Choose a genre that you enjoy. If you don't read much, think about your taste in TV and movies. If you love true crime shows, you may enjoy detective novels.

, It's easy to stay offline if you have a lot to do over the course of a day. There are a variety of hobbies you can take up that will keep you off the internet.Try something like crafting, gardening, crossword puzzles, or Sudoku.
Get involved in your community. Volunteer for an organization you care about.
If you have pets, invest time in them. Play with your cat each night. Take your dog for a walk.

, You may chat heavily on your smart phone. Work on limiting the amount of times per day that you check your phone.Make rules for yourself regarding smart phone use. For example, do not allow yourself to check your phone in social settings. Only allow yourself one phone check per two hours while working.
Leave your phone when you do certain activities. Keep your phone at home when you run to the store or go take a walk.
You can think about temporarily transitioning to a phone that does not have internet access. This way, you'll cut out one means of access to online chatting.

, If you're struggling with addiction of any kind, a therapist is necessary. If you have chatting addiction, you may have an underlying mental illness that's triggering your need to go online as a form of self soothing. Seek out a therapist if you have a chatting addiction.


You can ask your regular doctor for a referral to a therapist in your area. Make sure you look for someone who specializes in addiction and recovery. You can also find a list of providers through your insurance. If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling on behalf of your university.

, The types of therapy for chatting addiction vary. Oftentimes, cognitive behavioral therapy is very effective in treating addictive behavior. CBT teaches you healthy ways of coping with uncomfortable emotions like fear and anxiety. It also forces you to actively consider your thought patterns so you can recognize modes of thinking that lead you to online chatting.You can see what kind of therapy a psychiatrist or therapist uses by browsing his or her website. You can also call the office and ask. Many therapists use CBT to treat addictive behaviors.
You may be given homework during CBT. For example, you may be asked to write down your troubling thoughts for a week. Make sure to take your homework seriously, as it's important in addressing and treating your addiction.

, Sometimes, chatting addiction takes the form of flirtatious behavior online. You may, for example, engage in cybersex with strangers. If you're married, or in a committed relationship, this can cause strain. You can contact a marriage or relationship counselor to help you work through the addiction., It can help to strengthen the connections you have in real life. This will eliminate the need to go online. You can make plans with your real friends, reach out to family members, and try getting involved more in your community.


Try joining clubs. If there are any organizations that host meetings regularly, start attending. This will help you make more real life friends.
Reach out to people you haven't seen in awhile. If you only see a friend a couple of times a month, try to have more frequent interactions.

, You'll need support at home for your chatting addiction. Ask household members to help you curb your time online by discouraging you from using the internet. You can request things like weekly game nights and other activities to help give you an alternative to going online.

Assign and track tasks with the busybot chatbot.",How to Integrate Slack with Other Apps," You must be using the desktop Slack site in order to link other apps and services. You cannot link apps using the Slack mobile app.


You can only use the web version of Slack to link apps, but once apps are linked, anyone can use them through the mobile app.;
, This will open the team menu.

, This will open the Slack App Directory.

, There are hundreds of apps available through the app directory that can help your team's productivity in various ways. You can browse through the category list on the left side of the page, or search for a specific app.


It's recommended to install apps that you know your team will use. Too many apps can distract your team members from their work, but the right mix of apps can have a positive effect on productivity., If you are not an Owner for your team, you'll see the ""Request to Install"" button instead. You'll be able to attach a message that your team owners can view and then decide if the app is right., Some apps may prompt you to select the channel you want to add it to. If you suspect an app will get used a lot, you may want to create a new channel dedicated to the app directly.


Not all apps will prompt you for a channel, and will work in all channels.

, Many apps will require special permissions in order to connect with your Slack account. Make sure to read each permission carefully and ensure that you trust the service, especially if you're installing apps from locations other than the App Directory.

, Not all apps are available directly from the Slack App Directory. You'll need to visit the app's site in some cases in order to install it. Once you visit the app's site, click the ""Add to Slack"" button (this will vary depending on the app and site). You'll likely be prompted to connect your accounts, and then the app will be added to Slack.


The process for adding apps from other websites will vary drastically depending on the app. Make sure to read all of the provided directions in order to get the app integrated with Slack.

, Most apps will have basic instructions for use on their page in the App Directory. Since all apps serve different functions, it can be useful to review this information before you get started with it.

, Most apps work by using text commands in your group chat windows. Type ""/appname"" to see what happens with your new app.


For example, if you've install the Google Hangouts integration, typing ""/hangouts"" will give you the option to start a new Hangout for the current channel.

, Many apps will display basic command syntax when you use the command. The help information will only be displayed for you. Not all apps have a option.

, If your team is using certain apps a lot, your channel may start to feel cluttered. You can minimize your clutter by giving apps dedicated channels:


Create a new channel by clicking the ""+"" button above your channel list.
Name the channel after the app. For example, for a Twitter channel, you could call it ""#twitter.""
Inform your team members that the app should only be used in that channel.

, You can find many different chatbots that serve a variety of purposes in the App Directory. Chatbots are programs that act like a user, and your team members can interact with them through chatting.

, When you install a chatbot, you'll receive a direct message from it. This message will contain some introductory information about the bot. In order for your team members to use the bot, it will need to be added to a channel.


Click the Gear button above the channel chat window.
Select ""Invite team members to join.""
Select your new bot from the list of available members. You can search for it if you have a lot of members to choose from.

, If you don't know any specific commands yet, simply typing ""@botname"" will usually list off a few to get started with. Different bots will serve different purposes, and offer varying levels of interactivity.

, Since chatbots are designed to be used in individual channels, it's easy to create a dedicated channel for it. This will keep all of your team's interaction with the bot in one place. This can be useful for bots that aren't directly related to the point of the channel.


Click the ""+"" button above your channel list.
Name the new channel after the bot so that your team members can easily find it.
Invite the chatbot to the new channel and add your team members to it.

, This will open the App Directory.

, This will display a list of all of your installed apps, chatbots, and service integrations.

, When you select an item from the list, you'll see the configuration options for the app or chatbot. These options will vary depending on the app. Generally, apps that you can install directly from the App Directory will have more options listed here, while apps that were installed from another website may need to be configured on that website.

, Some apps will allow you to make detailed edits to their settings by clicking the ""Edit configuration"" button. This button looks like a pencil. Only some apps allow you to edit the configurations.

, You'll usually find this button at the bottom of the app's Details page. You'll be prompted to confirm that you want to remove the app or chatbot.


Not all apps are deleted the same way, and the ""Remove"" button may be located in a different place on the page.

, By integrating Drive with Slack, your team members will be able to quickly share files from their individual Drive accounts with the rest of the team.


Have each team member visit the Slack App Directory and click the Manage tab.
Click the Google Drive app in the list, then click ""Authenticate your Google Drive account.""
Allow Google Drive to connect with Slack.
Open your Google Drive webpage and find the file you want to share in Slack. Right-click the file and select ""Get shareable link."" This will copy a link to the file to your clipboard.
Paste the link in your Slack chat. Click ""Yes"" when prompted by slackbot to import the file.

, You can add a Twitter feed to Slack so that your team members are always aware of the latest tweets. This can be really useful for a customer service Twitter account.


Install the Twitter app from the App Directory by following the steps above.
Authorize the linked account on Twitter. Make sure you're signed in with the Twitter account you want to link.
Select what tweets you want to appear in Slack. You can choose to view all of the tweets sent to the account and all of the tweets sent by the account.
Select a channel for Twitter to appear in. You'll want to avoid putting Twitter in your #general channel or other unrelated channels. You can click ""create a new channel"" to make a channel dedicated to the Twitter feed.

, This bot will allow you to assign tasks to team members, and will help remind them when their tasks are due.


Install the busybot chatbot from the App Directory. You can find it in the ""Top Apps"" section.
Select the channels you want to add busybot to. During installation, you'll be prompted to select the channels that busybot will appear in. You can always invite it to other channels later.
Type ""@busybot task @user"" to assign a task to a specific user. For example, ""@busybot File your weekly report @John""

If you are starting the conversation, do not talk to them as soon as they are online, wait at least 10-15 seconds.,

Remain cool.,
See how long until they respond.,
Carry on more than one conversation if possible, it will help slow down on the quickness of your responses as well.

",How to Know How Often to Instant Message Someone Without Being Clingy," Also, unless you need to tell or remind them something, do not IM them in the same day just for conversation.;
, But don't take too long, or they'll think you're done with the conversation already, which doesn't make you seem ""clingy"", but it does make you rude.

, Getting excited will make you jump ahead and respond too quickly. Always take time to read their message carefully, this gives you time enough for them to know you're not cut out of civilization and dying to talk to somebody.

, Make the conversation personal, different people will expect different lengths, so checking to see how long it takes them to respond is a good idea. Although, if they are clingy, don't join in, remember the rules, but you can wait the minimum.

Host a no-sleep Thursday.",How to Make Friends on Instant Messaging," If your best friends have a computer set up with internet, you could try persuading them to get IM. They would probably be more than happy to, as it's cheaper than the phone. You could also persuade them to get a microphone or webcam later on.;
, If you are on Myspace, Facebook, any forum, or even a regular in an IRC chat room, you could ask one of your good online buddies on there if they'd like to exchange IMs. In some cases they'll say no, but don't be discouraged.

, While this may seem pretty creepy, if done right you'll seem normal. There are plenty of IM names floating around out there on the internet, but don't branch out too far. Don't talk to anyone just because you saw their IM name. You could say ""Hey, I saw some of your videos on YouTube, you are awesome! Keep up the good work!"" or ""Hey, your posts on {forum} are pretty funny. You rock!"" In most cases these compliments can turn into conversations in no time.

, Sometimes if you tell your friends about one, they'll tell someone else you don't know. If that person is nice and you aren't hostile towards each other AT ALL, you could become friends.

Before you get on or start talking, you may want to review over your day.,
Ask questions!,
Suggest playing a game.,
If all else fails, talk about something important to you.,
Be verbose in your responses.",How to Keep an Instant Message Conversation Interesting," Think of exciting, random, funny, etc. things to say or anything that may remotely interest the person you are messaging. These memories will give you a couple of stories to tell. Keep a couple of things to say in reserve, so you can fill in any awkward silences.;
, People love to talk about themselves, so it just takes one question to start the ball rolling. Any question like ""What did you do today?"" ""How are you?"" ""Would you rather (fill in question)"" ""Are you afraid of (noun)"" will make for some interesting talk.

, If you're young and enjoy an online game, invite them to play. Some instant messengers also have facilities for you to play games together while you talk!

, It doesn't have to be in enormous detail but enough to give them questions.

, ""Chat-speak"" is fine to use, but it is a lot harder to respond to an ""lol"", a "":)"" or a ""nm"". Don't speak too much though - that way the conversation won't stay interesting either! Keep a balance. A short but well thought-out sentence will be a whole lot better than writing an essay.

, Animated GIFs have become part and parcel of Internet communications. Millions of people have dedicated time and effort to putting together funny or otherwise entertaining animated GIFs. If you don't have one in mind to embed, just do a quick search. Try a query like funny gif or party gif or cat gif and you're bound to find one that sends just the message you're looking for.

, In order to embed the animated GIF in your Gmail message, you're going to need to save it, not just copy and paste it. Copying and pasting it will just paste a frozen image in, which is much less fun.


You can embed the image using the GIF's URL, but this will only work if you have the exact image URL, not the link of the page where the GIF appears. You can get this exact URL by right-clicking on the image and selecting Copy Image URL. If you have trouble with this, your safest bet is to save the file to your desktop instead.
To save the file to your computer, right-click on the picture and select Save Image As. Save it in a location you can access easily, like your desktop. Once you're done sending it, you'll be able to delete it.

, It looks like a mountain with a sun over it and is located in the toolbar at the bottom of the email you're composing. This will open a smaller window for selecting your image.

, Otherwise, your image will be added as an attachment, and recipients will have to open it to select it.

, You have two main options that'll work for GIF embedding: You can pick Upload, if you saved your GIF to your computer, or Web Address (URL), if you know the exact URL of the image.


If you pick uploading, drag and drop the saved GIF into the box, or click Choose photos to upload. Select your GIF, and click Open. The file should automatically be added to your email; if not, click Insert to confirm the upload.
If you decide to use a web address, paste the exact URL of the image into the textbox. If the URL is right, a preview of the image should appear. Then click Insert in the window to embed it.

, Click on the image itself, and it'll be highlighted by a blue box. From here, you can click and drag the corners of the box to the size you want it, or you can pick from Gmail's choices, including ""Small,"" ""Best fit,"" and ""Original size."" If necessary, you can also remove the image using the link that appears under the GIF.


If you want to move the GIF, you can drag and drop it to a different section of the email, or move the text around it, if that's easier.

, Once you've written your email, added your recipients, and have embedded your moving animated GIF, click Send to get your email on its way. You'll have your friends and coworkers giggling in no time.

Talk and idle.",How to Idle in IRC," They're not actually at their computer all the time; in fact, the connection might not even be coming directly from their computer at all. Idling in IRC allows your IRC client to stay connected to a server and sitting in the IRC channel while you're either not at the computer or in that channel. The benefit of doing this is that the IRC user can log on periodically to check what's going in IRC, can be contacted even when not in IRC, and can hang around several channels at once. It can also allow a user to quickly check the occasional conversation if the IRC channel is fairly quiet or if the conversation is compelling enough to join. For some frequent users of channels, the time taken to log out and log in again during the day makes idling a much easier and faster option. The method for doing this is usually through use of a shell account on remote servers or by using IRC bouncers:


A shell account is a user account that is located on a remote server which provides access to a shell via a command-line interface protocol such as telnet or ssh.An IRC bouncer is software that relays traffic and connections in computer networks in a similar manner to a proxy.It is a method that can provide the user with privacy (hiding the original source of the user's connection) and it also enables the user to manipulate the routing of traffic through a particular location.;
, Most shells or bouncers are hosted on servers running Linux, and will require some basic knowledge of Linux and the command line for you to be able to utilize it properly. Get started by reading How to learn to use Linux.

, Bouncers can be connected to through your favorite IRC client. Shell accounts allow more flexibility, but are limited to text-only. Other things to bear in mind include whether the method you want to use is permitted on your channels (read the fine print), whether it is compatible with your operating system and will do what you want it to do, and the ease with which you can use it. Another factor may involve whether you get it for free or have to pay. These are just some of the issues; do some further research on the two options before making your decision. And definitely ask friends about their choices and recommendations.

, Ask the idlers (when they're active) where they got their shell or bouncer accounts from. Chances are, some of them are hosting their own servers, and will happily let you have space on their server so you can idle as well.


If you're feeling bold, you can also try searching online for free shell or bouncer accounts and signing up for those. Often, these can be overpopulated or severely limited, so beware!

, Each provider has different ways they want you to set up your shell or bouncer account, so it isn't feasible to list any specifics here. What you need to do is read the instructions carefully and be sure to ask the provider any questions if you ever need help.


Instructions on how to get set up vary from provider to provider. There are different types of bouncer software as well as different types of distributions and setups of servers hosting shell accounts. If on a shell account, ask about screen and irssi, and how they prefer you to get set up and make changes to the config. Some administrators can get very picky and prefer to keep things organized in a special way!
Practice for a bit until you get the hang of using your idling feature. Ask people you know on the channel for guidance if you know they're using the same choice as yours.

, If you enter a channel and it looks as if there are a lot of people there but nothing is being said, say something. Eventually someone will notice and reply to you; you may need to be patient sometimes! And while you're waiting for an answer, idle in IRC.


You can find out how long someone has been idle by typing /whois and their name.
In many channels you can write someone's name to attract their attention when they're idle. This may result in a color change, a noise, or some other form of alert to let them know that someone is trying to get their attention. There is netiquette behind this though; don't overdo it. Use the person's name once and then wait; they will respond to you in due course when they're available. Constantly pinging them with their name will cause them to be frustrated and they may not respond at all.

Understand how the game works.,
Now that you've found out how the game works, it's time to look at the roles:


Villager - The villager is the simplest role.,
The more players you get in the game, the more roles there are.,
Learn the commands.,
Now that you know the concept, the roles,0 and the commands, it's time to begin.,
After night, the day begins.",How to Play Werewolf in IRC," There is a night and day cycle. At night, the wolves pick whom to kill, while everyone else ""sleeps"". Then, when they wake up, the villagers discover that one of them has gone missing or died, so they will discuss who might be the wolf. The villagers lynch their guess, hoping it's a wolf. The villagers win if they kill all the wolves; the wolves win if there are the same number of them as villagers.;
, In the daytime, you lynch (or vote on who to kill). You try to narrow down who the wolf(s) is/are. To vote for a lynch, enter the following into the chat: !lynch namehere. The bot will also accept part of the nickname.
Village Drunk - Only role is to serve as an identifiable villager. The village drunk does not have any special commands.
Harlot - The Harlot has the ability to visit people each night, to verify that someone is not a wolf. If you visit a wolf, or if you visit someone who gets killed by a wolf, you will die. You will not die if the wolf tries to kill you and you're not home. Watch for a query from pywolf detailing instructions to follow. Type !visit <name> in a private query to pywolf (not the IRC channel where the other players can see what you say).
Seer - The Seer is one of the most valuable roles in the game, either to kill or keep alive. When you're Seer, you can have a vision every night, to see the role of any other player. To see someone, type !see <namehere>. However, the seer will see a cursed villager as a wolf and a traitor as a normal villager.
Gunner - The Gunner has two bullets. You can chose to shoot during the day, and see if you shot a wolf. To shoot, just type !shoot namehere. You may do this in the IRC channel, so other people can see that you're not the wolf because you have bullets!
Traitor - When all of the wolves are dead, the traitor becomes a wolf.
Guardian Angel - (GA) The Guardian Angel can save someone each night, but if he or she saves a wolf, he or she could die.
Detective - (det) The Detective is similar to a Seer. This player can see roles of other players in the day. The Detective can see who is the traitor and cursed villager, but there's a chance he or she will reveal to a wolf when using his or her powers. Do !id <namehere> to check role of player.

, Here's a list of roles/players to get the roles:


6 = Village Drunk and cursed villager
8 = Harlot and second wolf
10 = Gunner and traitor
11 = GA
15 = Third wolf/Detective
22 = Fourth wolf
29 = Fifth wolf

, The commands are:


!lynch namehere (Anyone - Day time)
!kill namehere (Wolf)
!see namehere (Seer)
!visit namehere (Harlot)
!guard namehere (Guardian Angel)
!shoot namehere (Shooter/gunner)
!join (Joins you to the game)
!ping (Notified other members of the channel that a game may start)
!start (Starts the game)
!stats (Shows who is playing and how many parts there are)
!votes (Shows how many votes there are, and who got voted).

, To play, connect your IRC client to chat.freenode.net and join ##werewolf. If you don't have an IRC client, you can use an online webchat: http://webchat.freenode.net . When the game starts, see if you get a message from the bot running the game. If you do, you have a special role - in general, you don't want to reveal your role (especially if you're a wolf); the village drunk usually does reveal their role though. If you don't get a message from the game bot, you're a normal villager.


Act quickly if you have a special role (in PM with the bot), as the night only lasts two minutes.

, If you have been killed by a wolf, don't worry - wait and see how the game plays out and wait for the next game. The villagers (and wolves disguising themselves as villagers) will vote on who to lynch.

"
Start from the position of assuming good faith.,
If someone is deliberately provoking you, try to look beyond the provocation to find the source of their pain.,
Be aware that you are likely to be mingling with people from different cultures and different countries.",How to Avoid Arguments in IRC1," Typing words is never the same as face-to-face communications. When we cannot see each other, we lose a substantial amount of our ability to communicate. Without seeing the wink, the smiling eyes and the hand signals, for example, you can easily miss that someone is just joking rather than stating something seriously. Sometimes you can tell because you know the personality of the person typing but other times, well, words on a screen can seem quite different from the intention with which they were put across. If you assume first that no ill intent was meant, you can probably unravel lots of problems before they begin.

Ask if you don't understand something said. Much woe comes from misattribution of meaning or making up people's feelings from their bland statements. An example of asking for clarification might be: ""When you said X, I took this to mean you feel I am wrong. I feel bad if you misunderstood what I was trying to say - perhaps you'd like me to explain what I meant more clearly?"";
, In some cases, this will be enough to warn you to back off from what is unlikely to be a well constructed discussion. It can also allow you have some compassion for the challenger; maybe this person is in a bad situation and taking it out on others, rather than being a bad person. There can be various reasons behind nasty words, many of which are about the speaker's own state of mind or confusion.

If someone feels embarrassed, ashamed or scared, they might be defensive to ward off feelings of inferiority or fear of being attacked.
If someone feels that their personal values or moral beliefs have been threatened, they may respond with aggression. Topics that often cause heated argument include gay marriage, stay-at-home moms versus working moms, unemployment subsidies and gun control laws.
If someone is pre-disposed to being angry a lot of the time, it's probable that they will be angry in IRC. Whether it's a bad habit, a mental disorder or just the only approach this person ever uses when online, you cannot argue with a highly angry person and come out unscathed. In this case, the moderators will likely need to be involved to keep this person out of the playpen.
Watch out for people obsessed with blaming. High conflict individuals are prone to blaming others in a very intense way, using volatile words and accusations, often rapid-fire. Most times, this ""blaming"" is well out of proportion to something said or done. Realize that this person is not going to listen to reason as they're only interested in making you seem blame-worthy.

, Hot buttons for you politically or culturally may not be hot buttons for people living elsewhere. As a result, they may unwittingly be pressing your buttons without meaning anything negative, it's just that the issue isn't so ""hot potato"" where they come from. For example, some countries don't treat politics very seriously and find it unfathomable how politically touchy people in other countries can get."
"
Avoid flying off the handle.,
Think before typing.,
Find constructive ways to respond.,
Apologize.,
Let the facts speak.",How to Avoid Arguments in IRC2," First, know yourself. If you recognize that you are easily angered, be on the alert for the usual signs that warn you you're entering this state. You need to recognize that it is a reaction rather than a considered action, and in many cases, you may simply need to drop out of the chat room and come back later when you've regained your composure.

When you are tired, anxious, hungry or already angry about something else, you are more likely to be argumentative than at other times. If any of these states are an issue when you're in the chat room, think about taking a break and coming back later.
Competitiveness may set off a desire to react fast. If there seems to be an escalating discussion that appears to require a ""win"", this can cause out-of-control commenting that slides quickly into argumentation.
Be alert to feeling like you need to set someone else straight, punish another user or when you feel what has been said is unfair. Feeling any of these ways can lead you into arguing.
Notice when you feel you have a justified comment, but are at risk of using a mean or unfair way of relaying it. Cooling down may be needed before you can compose yourself and make your point factually.

, Do you even need to respond? Don't assume that responding is your default mode; saying nothing might be the better option. And if you do respond, reflect a little. Say your response out loud to gauge its worth: speak it out loud to yourself, to a pet, or towards the computer monitor instead of taking the time to type it out. If you can't think of any positive words, restrict yourself from typing anything.

Avoid name-calling or character assassination. Once you fall into this type of response, you are baited and the arguing can get very nasty. There is also a risk of saying something defamatory.
If you're worried that you regret what you're about to type, then your subconscious has already warned you. Any doubt means leave it out.
Remember that anything that goes online, stays online. For a very, very long time.

, There are various ways to respond should you choose to do so. These will depend on the context, how you feel about responding and what you intend by way of an end result. Some of the more common possibilities for responding include:

Neutral comments can work sometimes. For example, a simple ""thank you for your concern"" without further explanation shows that you will not be drawn into further discussion.
Simply make it clear that you've heard the other person. In some cases, this is sufficient. For example, ""Thanks for sharing that. I wasn't aware that things were so tough for you.""
If you are in a position to discuss the matter further off the public record, sometimes letting the person know that you're available for a private chat or email can resolve an issue. This can also allow others seeing the argument to pressure the challenger to accept such a resolution where this is appropriate. Only take this option if you feel strong enough to deal with the challenger in another forum.
Point out the bad behavior, never call the person bad. In some situations, pointing directly at the argumentative attitude can bring an end to it. For example, ""I appreciate that you're passionate about this topic but that isn't an excuse for using insults.""

, Sometimes ""sorry"" is all that is needed. You said something stupid, dopey, thoughtless or even outrageous. It happens sometimes. Apologize and move on. For example: ""I'm sorry I said that. It was stupid of me."" In most cases, avoid adding an excuse––it reduces the impact of your apology and can sound insincere.

""Sorry"" can be used to acknowledge another's pain. So, you didn't actually cause the issue being vented about, but it can sometimes soothe the other person if you say something like ""I'm sorry to hear that this has upset you. I wish it had been different for you.""

, If something has been said that is factually incorrect, correct it, especially where the inaccuracy mars your reputation or the reputation of others/your company/your brand, etc. This is one time when not responding is risky. However, this type of response can be done in a very matter-of-fact way without disparaging the other person and it should consist of nothing more than the correction, leaving a firm record that you provided the right facts."
"
Message a channel op privately.,
Put the challenger on ignore.,
Chat with other people who aren't arguing.",How to Avoid Arguments in IRC3," The op can then take action by telling the people in question to stop arguing. If the people in question ignore the ops, the ops may step in and use controls, such as silencing or kicking.
, Arguments continue when someone adds flames to the fire, or when they put their opinions into the situation. The IRC command to ignore someone is /ignore . When you ignore someone, you are unable to see what they are writing, but they and everyone else can see what you are writing.

It can be useful to state that you are refusing to continuing to engage with the challenger until they return to speaking civilly. This puts the challenger on alert that you really mean what you say, then you can use the ignore command and really do what you said you would.

, Be the stronger person and show others that the challenger is not getting to you. Have fun chatting with others... isn't that the purpose of being in a chat room? When the challenger sees you not give in to what they are saying, they might drop the fight or leave the chat room themselves. When they do, pat yourself on the back.
"
"
Take a break.,
Know how long it takes you to calm down.,
Avoid straying into arguments.",How to Avoid Arguments in IRC4," Close your IRC client/window or change your nickname to your ""away"" nickname and step away from the computer for awhile. You won't miss anything significant while you're gone, so don't attach yourself to the chat room. Read a book, talk to your friends on the phone, or get outside of the house for a few hours.


Try deep breathing. Deep breathing can be helpful because it causes you to slow down, be present and focus on the breathing cycle rather than the arguing.
Use self soothing to calm yourself. Self soothing techniques can be used to good effect where you feel that you have been somewhat bludgeoned, blamed or abused, to restore a sense of self and distance. Things to help can be to take a walk somewhere that you love being, eating something you enjoy and savoring it slowly or running a bath filled with bubbles and your favorite scent.

, Don't go back to the IRC until this period of time has truly passed. The amount of time is likely to vary dependent on the severity of the arguing––likely it will be longer if you felt your personal beliefs were attacked, while making you look silly as the butt of a joke probably requires less time for you to get over. It's very personal and you'll know when you feel steady and calm again.

Use self distancing. By removing yourself mentally from what is happening, you can take a detached view of the event and witness it as if were a play or story. You won't feel the aggression or anger when detached.

, If you are not a part of the situation, ignore it completely and don't voice opinions or comments about it. One comment may get you a free ticket of trouble. Even after a person leaves, don't say anything negative that is relevant towards the person or situation.

Have a side, private conversation with a trusted friend if you really feel the need to discuss what has been said on the channel with someone who was present. This will give you a safer outlet to let off steam than doing so in public. Just be sure to choose someone you really trust.
What if the person you wish to respond to isn't in IRC? Resist the temptation to gripe about that person with other IRC users. Will Bowen, founder of the Complaint Free World movement, recommends that you quit gossiping unless what you have to say is a) positive and b) something you'd say if the person were present. Most times your griping will get back to that person and can inflame things.

, This is an optional step. You can still try-out the application without an account. However, you won't be able to save your projects.

, See the section ""Popcorn Maker Interface Components"" below for details.

, Try adding events of each type to see first hand what they do.

, You can add the following types of content to a video:



Text and hyperlinks. The font and color of the text is customizable.

Images from other locations. Images added can be re-sized and stacked.

Google Maps.

Twitter word or user searches.

Wikipedia pages.

Popup texts and annotations.

, Control events include:



Loops. Using loops you can make the final video repeat selected portions of the original video a set number of times (or infinitely).

Pauses. These will pause the video at a certain position for a set number of seconds. This is great to make sure the viewer has the time to read the text or any other content you added to the video.

Skips. This will skip a portion of the original video. This can be used to delete certain portions of the video that you don't want in your final project.

, For example, you can add a loop that encompasses a portion of the video that extends for a 1 minute. At the last 20 seconds, in another layer you can add a pause and a text saying repeat this step three times. The video will then repeat the steps aforementioned three times, pausing at the end for 20 second each time to give the viewer time to see the instructions.

, To save a project, you must at least give it a name. You can also add an author. The project will then show up on your Projects List.

, The Popcorn application will provide you with HTML code to embed in your websites, emails, and posts to forums and community websites. The ""Share"" tab interface also includes buttons to share your video using Google+ and Twitter.

Add Google maps events to videos to expand the geographical information aspect of the video.,
Use layers to your advantage.",How to Use Mozilla's Popcorn Maker3,",, If you feel the speakers in the video are progressing fast, this is a big improvement. However, it is always a good practice to include transcripts of videos that employ conversational or commentary elements heavily.

,, For example, if the video is speaking about the solar system, most likely the terms ""light year, planet, sun, moon (as a celestial body), galaxy ... etc will be mentioned. Adding Wikipedia events for the pages of these terms might be a great informational addition to your video.

, Seeing what others are tweeting about a certain topic at the moment, in real time, might be very useful to viewers.

, The following are some suggestions of what you might do (thus, all are optional)


Add pictures of the people mentioned that appear, for example, at the corner of the video when their names are mentioned for the first time in the video.
Add Wikipedia events when the names are mentioned to the Wikipedia article talking about the celebrity or public figure.
Add a Twitter event with the name of the celebrities as the search term. You can add multiple Twitter events, one for each personality, and manage it so that only one of them appears at a time in the video.
Add popup or text events with links to the personalities' websites whenever they appear or are mentioned.
Add a brief description about each personality when it is mentioned

, Examples include:


Traveling and tourism videos: add maps to the mentioned countries, places and landmarks. Also create travel paths and add them.
Places where public figures have their main spot of influence (the state a congress senator is representing, the village where a celebrity was raised, etc)
A map of the areas mentioned in a newscast.

, For example, you can add text and popup events in top layers and add other more active elements in lower layers to add text to the components. For example a newscast reporting an accident might use a map of the general are of the accident, with text on top of it describing how the accident took place. It might even include a link to the website article about the accident in the news caster's blog!

The current position knob can be dragged to jump to any position in the video.
When you mouse-over the slide-bar, the current time indicator will be displayed at your mouse cursor.

, Layers/Tracks are where you will be adding your ""Events"" or objects such as text and hyperlinks.

Layers are like transparent placeholders for your events/objects. They have a stack-like structure where the topmost layer will have the most priority in displaying. That is to say, events in the top most layer will hide any events from layers that are ""below"" it and that overlap with the event (occupy the same space on the screen).
Each layer is displayed as a box in the Pane.
Each layer has a handle from which you can drag and drop the layer to change its position relative to other layers.
When you mouse-over a layer's name, the ""Delete Layer"" button appears. You can use that to delete a layer/track.
You can use the ""Add a new track for your events"" button to add extra layers/tracks.

, This is where you'll drop your events and decide when they will be displayed when they will fade away.

Drop an event into one of the tracks/layers to add an event to that track.
Use the re-size handles that appear on the sides of an event to stretch it or shrink it.

Stretching/shrinking to the left makes the event start earlier/later. It changes the time the event starts.
Stretching/shrinking to the right makes the event end later. It changes the time the event ends.



,

The timeline zoom slide-bar is used to zoom in and out of the timeline. This affects how much of the real timeline is displayed in the timeline selector bar. When zoomed out to the maximum level, the selector bar represents the whole timeline of the video. All events are minimized/zoomed out to fit in the selector bar. When zoomed in, the selector will only represent a portion of the actual timeline. You'll have to scroll left or right to see the rest of the timeline.
The timeline selector represents a portion of or the whole timeline. It is used to select which portion of the represented timeline is displayed in the tracks timeline pane.
You can adjust the ""window"" that selects the portion of the timeline to be displayed by resizing it using the handles to its right and left.

, Events are objects you can add to the video. You can then modify or customize the object's properties using both the editor pane and, sometimes, using visual elements such as dragging and dropping, resizing handles .. etc.
Manage the base media used in the project. You can change the base video that you want to edit and add ""fallbacks"".
Obtain a link to your finished video to share with everyone.

,


You can change the base media by changing the link in the text-box for the media source. You can add links to videos from Youtube, Vimeo, Soundcloud, or an HTML5 video.
If you choose to add an HTML5 video, you'll have to provide 3 versions of your video: mp4, ogv, and webm. The first will be the media source and the other two will be the fall-backs. This is to support all major browsers.

,


If you haven't saved your project, when you switch to the share tab, you will be asked to name your project. After that, the save button will be enabled.
After saving your project, you'll be able to obtain an HTML snippet to embed your video in other websites (and most HTML-enabled emails).

,


You add events to your project by dragging the type of event you want and dropping it in the track you desire. You can then modify the duration of the vent either using the event's properties page or visually through dragging it to the appropriate location in the timeline and modifying its duration using the size handles at the sides of the event.
All events have a properties page that will be displayed in the events tab when you select the event in the tracks' timeline.
The properties of each event differ from the other type of events. However, they are all designed to provide ways to customize the event. Almost all events have a start and end time properties that define when, within the video, will that event be displayed and when it will end.

Loop events: allows you to choose portions of the video to be repeated for a specific number of times (or indefinitely).
Pause events: pauses the video at a certain point for a specified period of time (or indefinitely).

,,,


The Start and End properties are common to all types of events in Popcorn Maker. They denote the times, relative to the original video's start, when the events start and finish respectively. Pause events are the exception. The ""end time"" is meaningless in pause events, only the start time is taken into consideration when implementing the event.

In a pause event, the start time is when will the video pause. The end time is not necessary and won't affect the event's behavior.
In loop events, start and end times denote the start and end of the portion of the video that will be repeated.
In skip events, start and end times denote the beginning and end of the interval in the video that will be skipped (jumped, forwarded).


The ""Number of loops"" in a loop event is the number of times that you want the loop interval to repeat. Setting this to 0 will cause this portion to repeat indefinitely.
The ""Pause Duration"" in a pause event is the amount of time (in seconds) that you want the video to be paused. Setting this to 0 will pause the video indefinitely (viewers will still be able to continue playing the video past the pause point if they press the play button).

"
"
Use the Pause Event in the following case:



You want to slow down the video.,
Use the Loop Event in the following cases:


If you are creating a mash-up (especially a funny one) of an already existing video, loop events can create a funny repetition effect if set to short durations/intervals.,
Use the Skip Event in the following cases:



You want to completely remove a specific interval from your video.",How to Use Playback Control Events in a Mozilla Popcorn Maker Project2," Add multiple pause events along the timeline of the video, and set them to short durations to slow down the video. Choose the areas where you add the pauses to mainly be empty or silent areas of the video, for example between sentences. This can be useful to allow the viewer time to read and view other instructional or informational content you added to your video using the other types of events.

In cases where you need to give the viewer a warning about the following content in the video. For example, to warn the viewer of spoilers coming ahead, or when the following content contains violent scenes that should not be watched by children. In such cases you can add a pause event and set its duration to 0 so that it will pause the video indefinitely. You can then add a text event containing your warning. You should make sure the start time of the text event is the same as; or before the start time of the pause event.

In cases where you want to give the user a choice of continuing or jumping to another video. For example, if you're creating a series of instructional videos on a certain topic and the series is incremental in level (each episode/lesson targets a more advanced topic than the one before). It might be useful if, after the first few seconds of each video, you add a pause and display a popup event that asks the viewer whether they want to skip to the next lesson, episode. The popup itself should be a link to the next video. If the viewer decides he/she wants to continue this video, they just wait for the 2 or 3 seconds pause duration.

,
If you are creating an instructional video that requires the viewer to repeat a certain action a set amount of times. Here's an example:

Sports and exercises instructional videos. Especially ones created as a ""do-while-you-watch"" video. In such cases, shoot the action once. Then, in Popcorn, add a loop event spanning the interval of the action and set the number of loops to the desired number of times. You should however, say something about how many times the action should be repeated before the loop begins. You can also add a text event at the end of the loop saying that this action should be repeated X times.


If you're creating a video that includes a twist at the end of a certain scene and you're not sure everyone watching will get that twist the first time. For example, a kid doing something totally unexpected while playing with his parents that takes a very short time. In such cases, you can add a text event right after the twist happens saying something in the lines of ""let's see that again, this time, concentrate on the child in the right corner1"". You then add a loop event spanning the whole event.

, For example, if your video contains violent scenes, you can provide viewer with two links, one for children, where you add a skip event spanning the violent scene, and one for adults that doesn't include the skip event. Another case is when the video contains spoilers that you want to remove.

Log-in to Popcorn Maker.,
Change the media source to point to your video (optional).

,Click the ""Events Tab"" in the ""Editor Pane""

,
Drag a ""Wikipedia"" event into your video preview window or a specific layer in the tracks' timeline.
,
Edit the Wikipedia event's properties in the Properties Pane to the right.,
Preview your video using the play/pause button and the location slide-bar.",How to Add Wikipedia Events to a Mozilla Popcorn Maker Project," You will need a Mozilla Persona account for this step.;
,,,, If this pane is not showing, make sure you select the event you added by clicking it in the track timeline.



The ""Start"" and ""End"" values indicate when the Wikipedia frame you added will start displaying and when will it disappear. The time values are relative to the beginning of the video. That is, 0 is the start of the main video, 10 is 10 seconds after the main video starts, and so on.

The ""Language"" field allows you to specify which Wikipedia Language are you referencing. This will specify which Wikipedia domain that article will be pulled from. The combo-box offers the languages currently supported by Wikipedia

The ""Article Link/Title"" field is where you write the title of or the link to the article in Wikipedia that you want to embed.

The ""Transition"" field allows you to set the animation used to show the Wikipedia article frame when it first appears. Available options are: None (no animation), Pop, Fade, Slide Up, and Slide Down.

, Adjust the event's properties accordingly.

Gain some experience editing existing instructional videos with Popcorn Maker.,
Avoid the following:


Detailed voice narration: Since audio can't be edited in Popcorn, that means that any verbal instructions can't be updated as the instructions in the article are.,
When filming, leave enough room in the frame for text and popups.,
Keep in mind that music will make the video harder to edit with certain events.,
Give each scene enough time for written instructions to be added.,
Leave enough time at the end for links to similar projects.",How to Make a Wiki‐Friendly Instructional Video for Popcorn Maker," You can use any video on YouTube or Vimeo. As you're remixing the video, you might notice certain things that frustrate you, like wanting to add a written tip in a scene, but the scene is too short, or there is no room to add text without obscuring the video. Having the perspective of a Popcorn Maker user, you'll be better able to make a video that will be easier for others to remix.;
, If you want to add broad verbal introductory statements though, like the title of the video, that should be fine as long as it's something that you don't foresee changing as the accompanying wiki article grows.
Text instructions: These can be added with Popcorn Maker, and can then be edited by remixing. If, for example, a step is edited to be more accurate, the same edit can be made on the video.
Making yourself a prominent part of the video. Since the focus here is on making a wiki video, you'll want to avoid making it seem like the video is the work of a single person. In the wiki world, this tends to discourage people from wanting to improve it, because they see it as ""belonging"" to the person who made it. Also, if you're a prominent part of the video, people will associate the content with you no matter how much it changes (and you don't have control over how people remix the video).

If you want to give the video some kind of stamp of where it came from, a watermark makes better sense.



, There should be sections in your frame where you could foresee text being added in a way that doesn't interfere with the usefulness of the video.

, That doesn't mean you should avoid it altogether, since otherwise you'll have a very quiet video, but the loop, skip, and pause events will break of up the music if they are used in remixing.

, You'll want the person watching the video to have a chance to read the instructions that are added in Popcorn Maker.

, A good way to end an instructional video is to show the person watching it some other how-to projects they might enjoy. These can be added later with links and images, and they may change as cooler projects are written about.

Make use of project management if you can.,
Assign a project ""coordinator"".,
Assign tasks.,
Understand that Popcorn Maker is a tool that most likely will make your job easier (as a team).,
Note that the following tasks are usually required.,
Use Mozilla's Popcorn Maker to facilitate prototyping during the various phases of the project.",How to Use Popcorn Maker to Collaborate on Creating a Video1," After all, creating a video is a project. It has:


Start and finish dates. At least estimates.
Tasks breakdown. How will you approach creating the video, in a step-based format.
Human resources. Who is in? Who will do what?
Other resources. What video editing programs does your team have in total? Who has what?;
, This is one person who will be responsible for supervising the whole process. This is a responsibility not a badge. The rest of this article assumes the reader has taken this role in various situations. This person will have to:



Keep the records. Things like time schedules, reminders, tasks progress … etc will be the coordinator's responsibility.
Centralize the various efforts in one final place. The coordinator should keep an eye on the different tasks assigned to different team members. When one member finishes her/his task, the coordinator should make sure that this member's work is added to the project's final outputs' template. This is after coordinating and communicating the feedback on the member's finished work from other teammates (if necessary).

Keep everyone posted of where the project stands. Any emergency that might occur (like an editor leaving the team, a new member coming, changes in the main conceptual design of the video … etc) must be communicated to everyone so they adjust their plans and efforts accordingly.

, Every member of the project should have a task that is in accordance with their skill set and their resources (software they have, time they can spend on the project … etc)


Since this is a collaborative effort, everyone should approve their role. Even more, you might need everyone to volunteer to a specific role.
There is a lot of tasks layout schemes and methodologies out there for breaking down the tasks related to creating a video. This article provides a simple alternative or two. Those are not in any way conclusive, comprehensive or suitable for all situations. Your team members have to work together to reach a suitable model for your specific project.

, However, it's not going to do all the work for you. You will need other tools ranging from a communication platform (email, forums, wiki pages) to an offline video editor.

, This is a general casual description of tasks, based on the fact that the article is targeting amateur small teams of online collaborators.


Scripting. This includes writing the transcript of any dialog that takes place between actors in the video. It also includes any narration. People with strong linguistic abilities usually are fit for this. This does not have to be a language guru's job (if you can find one, it won’t hurt however). It also depends on the type of language usually used in your specific kind of video. For example, whether your video is about orchestra music, chewing gum, cars, sports or nuclear physics will dramatically change the type of language used in the video.

Directing. This is the person that will suggest changes on the way actors act, scripts are spoken, scenes are ordered, graphical effects are applied, transitions are implemented between scenes, and other creativity issues. Think of the director as a quality control officer! Creativity and taste is a must for directors. However, the online collaborative experience might allow most members of the project to contribute.

Voice Actors. Those are the ones who will speak the lines of the transcript. These are the persons with natural “broadcasting voices”. Some videos might only contain voice actors. For example, a video explaining how to use a certain software product might never require someone actually showing their faces, but hearing the steps while you see them will be nice.

Video Actors.

Counter-intuitively, those might not be human at all! Some of the most successful videos are cartoons! If you decide to implement the video using non-human actors (cartoons, comics, image slide-shows … etc) you will need people who can actually produce those actors.
Another type of counter-intuitive actors are ""body parts"". Some successful videos only show the hands of the actual actor! For example, a cooking recipe how-to video does not require the cook showing their face (although that might be nice)


Sound/Video ""Engineers"". Well, since the article is targeted mainly towards amateurs, they do not have to be actual engineers, only people who can use audio/video editing software.

, Following is a list of areas where Popcorn might be used to enhance the experience. Sometimes, it can even be used to actually implement the whole task.

"
"
Create a blank video and upload it to a popcorn maker supported platform (such as YouTube).,
Mix the video using Popcorn Maker.,
Share the link to the mixed video with everyone else in your project.,
Modify the concept design you began with.,
Make sure the concept design includes a breakup of scenes.

,
Once the team approves a template concept design, make it official.,
Create another blank video to b used with later phases of the project.",How to Use Popcorn Maker to Collaborate on Creating a Video2," The video has to be the same length as the final product. This can be agreed upon using the communication platform that you decided to use. Some suggestions are emails, mail groups, mailing lists, forum threads, wiki pages and talk pages … etc.


There's a variety of open source and freeware video editors capable of creating blank videos. All you'll need is an image containing only the video's background color.

,


Add text and popup events containing comments, suggestions and explanations. This can also be used to suggest assignments of tasks.
Add images containing sketches or prototypes.
Add links to useful resources that can be used in different regions, aspects or features.

, Allow everyone to re-remix adding their thoughts and posting their remixed video to the communications platform. If you suggested a task assignment, here, people can start volunteering or rejecting tasks, suggesting modifications to the assignment schemes. Basically, you have a kind of a video based forum or email system!

, Add approved suggestions, remove disapproved ones, and add anything you might have found out during the process.

,, Put everything you have so far to the mix and post a link to it. This one should become a reference, so remixing it again should occur very seldom if at all.

, This is optional but might save much effort and confusion should anything happen in the future.

"
"
Assign script writers to scenes.,
Start with a blank video that is uploaded to one of the popcorn supported platforms.

,
Decide whether you will work on script writing sequentially or in parallel.,
Send the blank video's link to script writers, along with their designated scenes' start and end times.

,
Follow up on the script writers depending on the model of work you decided earlier.

,
Merge the different scripts into one remix (if you decided to work in parallel) or take the final remix (if you chose to work sequentially), and post to the project team.

,
Make a document-format of the script if possible.",How to Use Popcorn Maker to Collaborate on Creating a Video3," This could have been done during concept development.

,, This is necessary if you have more than one script writer.


Working sequentially has the merit of using only one remix for the final prototype. In this method, the first script writer starts (this does not necessarily be the one assigned the first section of the video). After they finish, the next script writer remixes their remix, reserving all their work on the new remix. This goes one until the last writer is done. This last remix will contain the approved work of everyone before along with the final work. This means it is actually the scripting final product.
Working in parallel save time if the script is long. Every writer starts with the blank video and adds their assigned script. This way, if one is finished before the others, the scripts might be reviewed by the team, modified and approved and the writer starts working on something else. However, at the end, someone will have to take all the different remix and merge them in one final remix. This task can be tedious if the video is long.

,,,, This will include the actors, the line they will be speaking, and when in the video they will say it. It's a scenario!

"
"
If the video contains slide shows, cartoons or images, popcorn can come in handy in showcasing the images and how they will appear in the actual video.

,
Since audio is relatively easier to edit than video, you can start with voice acting immediately after the scripting is finished.,
Note that most of this part will rely on software other than popcorn.,
Add everything that is approved to the base video so as to remove any elements that no longer have any use.",How to Use Popcorn Maker to Collaborate on Creating a Video4,", This way you can get a rough near final audio track and add it to the blank video, so future collaboration can be based in an audio-full video. This way, remixing videos will be easier after removing all the text representing things that was already voice-acted.

, This is mainly because popcorn still does not support exporting to a video format that can be handled by other video editing software. It also does not support multiple sound tracks or sound editing.

, Keep the original remixes however. You can remix the same video a thousand times and the base video will remain the same! Make use of that fact!

"
"
Use popcorn to add acting notes to actors on their respective lines or actions during a scene.

,
Use pauses, loops and skips to emphasize points, delete undesired scenes and add long notes.

,
Add notes to audio/video editors on what to do on certain areas.",How to Use Popcorn Maker to Collaborate on Creating a Video5,",, You might employ the skips and pauses again here.

"
"
Use the remix button on popcorn made remixes to ask for or provide feedback.,
When sending status/progress reports, popcorn can be a real nice tool.",How to Use Popcorn Maker to Collaborate on Creating a Video6," This is not tied to particular phase. It can be used throughout the whole project.

, Instead of the rigid written documents, people get to “see” your feedback, reports, task assignment, and the progress of other work real-time, and in video form!

Add the right interests.,
Start your conversation the right way.,
If you want to avoid trolls, make it clear.,
Learn how to identify trolls and bots.,
Don't be afraid to disconnect.,
Have fun on Omegle without talking to trolls.,
Don't be tricked by trolls.,
You will encounter almost every type of person on Omegle.",How to Have an Actual Conversation on Omegle," Omegle allows you to choose interests so you can be matched with people who like similar things. But beware: some interests are more dangerous than others, so proceed at own risk. Religion and other controversial topics are especially prone to extremists, trolls, and people you don't want to meet.

If you notice there are lots of trolls or bots with a certain interest, remove it and try again after a week.;
, Saying ""ASL"" or ""I'm horny"" isn't a good start. You could say ""Hi.""or simply ""Hello, what's up?""

, After introducing yourself, say something like, ""I don't want to be rude, but if you are horny, can't speak English, or don't want to actually have a conversation, please disconnect.""

, There are key ways to point out people who are trolls. They may say something very random and offensive at the start of the conversation, or simply say ""I'm horny"". They usually type first, and type often, as well. Bots leave automated messages and are often instant replies that don't relate to the subject.

, If the person you are talking to seems to be weird, simply disconnect. Also, if the person starts a conversation by saying ""asl"" they are most likely looking for someone to have cyber sex with.

, Some people may say something random, so play along. If it is offensive, disconnect, but sometimes the best conversations start the weirdest.

, They may send you a message saying Omegle has tracked your IP address, or that Omegle has classified them as a sex offender, usually ending with fake contact information. These are all fake, don't be tricked.

, You'll come across the people who seem to be honest, the obvious liars, the trolls, the horny people, the people looking for a laugh, the people who say they are on the verge of suicide, the people who are going through boredom and the normal people. Learn how to handle the people and you can turn almost any conversation into a fun one.

Consider waiting a few days.,
Open a Google search and type ""my ip"" to find your current public IP address.,
Check your network hardware.,
Unplug the power from your modem.,
Disconnect your modem from your router.,
Let your modem sit unplugged for about an hour.,
Connect your modem directly to your computer.,
Plug your modem back in.,
Check your public IP again by typing ""my ip"" into Google.,
Switch back to your router when you want another new IP.",How to Get Unbanned from Omegle1," Omegle bans typically don't last longer than a week, so if you can wait your ban will likely go away on its own. If you can't wait, you can try getting a new public IP address.;
, This is the address that Omegle sees when you connect, and is the address that they used to ban you.


Make note of this address so that you can check if it was changed later.

, This method will work best if you use a cable or DSL modem and a separate router. If you have a modem-router combo, or connect your modem directly to your computer, this may not work. Your computer will also need an Ethernet port.

, Most home internet services use a ""dynamic IP address."" This means that the internet service provider (ISP) assigns you a random IP within a certain range when your modem is detected by their network. Resetting your modem can help get your connection a new IP address.


Not everyone will have a dynamic IP address, though most home users will. If this doesn't work for you, see the next section.

, Dynamic IP addresses are usually reassigned when the modem detects a new MAC address. You'll be connecting your modem directly to your computer instead of your router, providing a new MAC address (your computer's) to the modem., Sometimes you can get a new IP within 30 seconds, sometimes it will take an hour or two. The time it takes is dependent on your ISP's policies.

, Use an Ethernet cable and connect your modem directly to your computer's Ethernet port.


Make sure to disconnect from any wireless networks on your computer.

, Plug your modem back in and wait a few minutes for it to power up and connect. Your computer will get an internet connection directly from the modem.

, If your IP address is different than it was, you've successfully changed your public IP. If the address is the same, you can try a VPN.

, If the method above worked, you'll be able to get a new dynamic IP address by performing the same steps but connecting the modem to your router again. This will provide the router's MAC address to the modem, getting you a new IP. You can go back and forth whenever you need to change your IP address.

Find a fast, reliable VPN service.,
Sign up for the VPN service.,
Find the list of VPN server addresses.,
Connect to the VPN.,
Visit the Omegle site.",How to Get Unbanned from Omegle2," VPNs (virtual private networks) allow you to mask your IP address by routing your internet traffic through a server in another location. Omegle will think you're connecting as the VPN server and not from your home network. VPN services will often result in slower speeds, so you'll want to find one with a fast connection. This is especially important for video chatting. VPNs cost money, but you can usually get a refund if the service won't work with Omegle.Popular VPN services include IPVanish, ExpressVPN, and HideMyAss.
You can try free proxy sites to access Omegle, but most of these will be banned already as well. See Use a Proxy for details if you want to try anyway.
If you get banned often, this is not going to be a very economical approach. You'll be better off trying to change your IP using the method above.

, When you sign up, you'll be given a user name and password. You'll need this to be able to connect to the VPN.

, Your VPN service should have a list of addresses that you can choose to connect to. You can usually find this on their Support page, or in your welcome email message.

, The process for connecting to a VPN varies depending on your operating system:


Windows - Right-click the Network icon in the System Tray and select ""Network and Sharing Center."" Click ""Set up a new connection or network."" Select ""Connect to a workplace"" from the list of options. Choose ""Use my Internet Connection (VPN)."" Enter the VPN server address, then your user name and password.
Mac - Click the Apple menu and select ""System Preferences."" Click the ""Network"" option. Click the ""+"" button at the bottom of the list of networks. Select ""VPN"" from the ""Interface"" menu. Click ""Create"" and then select your new VPN connection in the list of networks. Enter your VPN server address, user name, and password. Click ""Connect"" to connect to your VPN.

, If you're properly connected to your VPN, you should be unbanned when you visit the Omegle site. If you're still banned, check your network connection to ensure you're actually connected to the VPN and not your regular network.


If you get banned again, you'll need to change your VPN server to another on the list.

Choose whether or not the messages should be marked as read.,
Click ""Create filter"".",How to Create a Filter in Gmail2," Labels are a way to sort emails in Gmail, since there is nor folder feature. Labels allow you to categorize your emails and keep your inbox from overflowing.


You can create a filter by clicking the Gear icon, selecting Settings, clicking the Filters tab, and then clicking the ""Create new filter"" link at the bottom of the page.

, There are a variety of ways that you can filter your incoming messages. The choices you make will depend on what you want filtered.


For example, if you want all emails from your favorite online store to be filtered into one label, you might enter the email address for the mailing list into the ""From"" field, or put the store's name in the ""Has the words"" field.
If you want to create a label for all of your emails that have attachments, you can check the ""Has attachment"" box.
If you want to create a label for an event or for certain conversations that have the same subject line, you can enter it into the ""Subject"" field.

, Once you've determined what messages will be filtered, you can create a label for them. In the next window, check the ""Apply the label"" box, and then click the drop-down menu next to it. Select ""New label"" and then create the label you want to apply. You can choose to make the label appear nested under an existing label for more organization.

, By default, a label will be applied to the messages, but they will still appear in your inbox. If you'd rather sort them a bit so that you only see the messages when you select the label, check the ""Skip the Inbox"" box.

, Gmail bolds all of the messages that you haven't read yet. If you don't want the label to be bolded all of the time, you can set all of the emails that get put in the label to be marked as read. Check the ""Mark as read"" box to enable this.


Marking your emails as read may make it difficult to tell when you've received new messages, since there won't be any visual indication that a new message has appeared in the label.

, Your new labeling filter will be created, and your new label will be selectable on the left side of the Gmail page. Any messages that fit the filter you created will appear when you click the label.

This can be especially useful if you want to use your Gmail account as a ""catch-all"" email address and then forward the important messages to your real email account.


You can create a filter by clicking the Gear icon, selecting Settings, clicking the Filters tab, and then clicking the ""Create new filter"" link at the bottom of the page.

, You can specify addresses, subject lines, keywords and more. Any message that meets these criteria will be forwarded to the address you set in the next step.


Click ""Create filter with this search"" when you are finished setting your criteria.

, Check the ""Forward it"" box, and then select your forwarding address from the drop-down menu. All of the messages that meet the filter criteria will be sent to this address.


You can choose to delete the messages from your Gmail account after they are forwarded by checking the ""Delete it"" box.

, Your new forwarding filter will be created, and any future messages that meet your filter criteria will be forwarded to the address you specified.


Unlike other filter options, you cannot retroactively apply this filter to existing messages. Only future messages will be forwarded to the address you set.

The more unique your name, the wiser it is to guard it for professional use only.;
, It is wise to choose a screen name that does not give away your age, such as ""Roses17"" or ""Jelly 34"". Most people would be able to tell what this means.


This isn't just for the very young. As you grow older, you may not want people guessing just how old you've become!
This includes graduation year dates; don't use them as they give away too much self-identifying information.

, It is wise to choose a screen name that does not give away where you live, such as ""Denver Chick Lucy"", or ""Madison Avenue"". Also avoid usernames that would reveal your zip code, such as ""Logan21508"". Don't even give away your state, city or country.

, Having a screen name such as ""I Hate Sally"" or ""I Beat Up Joe"" obviously will get some people angry. Names with political or religious agendas attached to them will rub a lot of people up the wrong way too––avoid using them. Remember too, that what might be funny or ironic where you live might be disparaging or even unkind somewhere else in the world; you are interacting with people from all over the world, so be worldly wise.

, Come up with a first or a last name totally unrelated to you. Add only your first or your last name to the stage name but not both. Or, don't even do that––add together two totally unrelated names you like the sound of together. Everyone will know you by your stage-name style screen name! For example: Adelaide Anders or Martha Smith.

, Combine the name of a favorite pet or object with a surname or other name. For example, Woofie Bugbear; Trixie Paws; Reptilian Greg; Ovalbowl Harry; PurpleCrayonMarsha.

, There are plenty of online name generators that will do the work for you. You can choose from pirates, fantasy beings, animals, favorite words, etc.

Click the Menu Icon to view other options.,
Select ""Contacts"".,
Check to make sure file was saved.,
Sign out of the original account.,
Click on the same menu button of the windows live messenger software but this time select Contacts then, ""Import instant messaging contacts..."".,
You must select the previously saved Hotmail contacts file in order to get those contacts so that it can import them to your new account.,
If you clicked ""Yes"" to proceed, then another window will come up informing you that the add requests were sent and that contacts may take a moment to appear in your list.,
You have now imported your contacts from the original account to the new one!",How to Import Contacts from One Hotmail Account to Another," Make sure the account you have chosen contains all the specific contacts that you would like to Import to your new account. If there are contacts that are not preferred, simply remove or delete them from your list prior to the process. Therefore, please take the time to review your contacts before advancing.;
, This shortcut to the menu is located at the top-right, right under the inbox button of the windows messenger program. To confirm your selection, the icon should say ""Show Menu"" when ever your cursor hovers over it and should contain a downward arrow for drop-down list of options. NOTE: this button can be accessed from two locations depending on your setup.

, Then, ""Save instant messaging contacts"".


This should then pop up a window that will ask you what folder you would like to save your contacts in. Then, you must choose a safe folder to save your contacts. This folder MUST be safe so that later on in the process, you are fully capable of accessing this file without it disappearing. NOTE: this action will save ALL the contacts that are currently in your list.







, After the folder has been selected to ""Save File"" in, make sure the file did get saved in that specific directory. This step is required because if the file cannot be found later on, then you will have to go and save your contacts again. Therefore, please do check just in-case you made a mistake and accidentally saved the file containing your contacts in a dangerous non-accessible place.

, When you have saved your contacts list in a trusted folder, you are then ready to move on. To continue, you must now sign out of the currently opened account and log in to your second or new account. This is done because the only reason your original account was required was because of the contacts that it contained. That is why; this is an essential step in the process of eventually importing the contacts to your newer account.

, This option should be located right under the save instant messaging contacts option that was previously used. This action will likely open up a new window.

, The file that you select must be the same one that was saved earlier in Step#3 using the ""save instant messaging contacts..."" option under the menu button.


That last selection will lead you to a confirmation window which will show up displaying the summary of your decision to import. This includes all the selected contacts email addresses as well as a confirmation message that reads; ""Are you sure you want to add these people to your contact list?"" Simply click the ""Yes"" option to confirm you decision. NOTE: once confirmed, an invite will be sent to each individual person therefore, this is likely the last chance you have at refusing to import.







, So, simply hit ""OK"" to close the message and move on to the final step.

, To check if the contacts have accepted you and that this process worked, simply check your account to see if the actual name of the person that you sent an invite to is displayed in your contacts list rather than their default email ID which is only displayed until that user accepts your invitation.

Understand that everything you do and say is logged.",How to Chat," Ask yourself if you will be chatting mainly with friends or mainly with strangers. There are different chat programs and services that are suited for different types of chatting. Are you going to be chatting one-on-one with friends and family? Are you more interested in chat rooms that anyone can join, or chatting directly with strangers? How anonymous do you want to stay?
, The most important thing to consider when you want to chat with people you know is what program they use. In order to chat with someone, you’ll need to use the same program or service that they do.


Chances are your friends and family use Facebook, which comes integrated with a chat program. You can use this chat to talk with other Facebook users on their computer on through mobile phones. You will need to be Facebook friends with the person you want to chat with.

Skype is one of the world’s most popular direct chat programs, and offers a little more anonymity than Facebook. You don’t have to use your real name to sign up for a Skype account. Skype has recently absorbed MSN, another popular chatting app, making MSN users Skype users.
There are a variety of direct chat apps available for smartphones. Some of the most popular include Kik, SnapChat, and WhatsApp. You will need to add other users to your contacts before you can chat with them.

AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) is another chatting program that has declined in usage over the years but still remains popular. You will need to add other users, but you don’t have to use your real name.

, There are a huge number of chat services that you can access through your browser. These are typically anonymous in that you have a username that you use instead of your real name. Popular sites include:


Omegle and Chatroulette are both is a direct chat programs that connect you with another random user. This programs use your webcam if it is attached. You don’t have any control over the person that you are about to talk to.
There are a variety of websites that host chat rooms. These include video chats as well as text chats. Popular sites include Yahoo! Chat, Tinychat, Spinchat, and many more.

, While chat rooms are declining in popularity, there are still many large, active chat communities out there. Most need special software to connect to, while others are browser-based.



IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is one of the oldest collection of chat rooms on the internet. You can still find chat rooms for a wide variety of interests. You will need to download an IRC client in order to use it, most of which can be found for free.
ICQ is a chat protocol that has been around since the days of AOL. There are a variety of programs that you can use to access ICQ, such as the official ICQ client, Trillian, and Pidgin.

, Beyond the ways listed above, there are a massive number of ways that you may find yourself chatting with others. Online games, school and work settings, technical support, and many more are all venues that you may end up chatting online with others. All of these different communities have different standards and ideas of acceptable and expected behavior

, Netiquette is a term that basically refers to acting politely on the internet. The need for good netiquette has arisen as anonymous posting online has led to increases in abuse and unfriendly behavior. By practicing good netiquette, you help build the online community and contribute to a more productive atmosphere., Ask yourself if you would say the same things if you were face to face with the person. Just because you are in an anonymous setting doesn’t mean you should act as if there are no consequences to your words.


Netiquette is a relative idea depending on where you are and who you are interacting with. If you are chatting with friends, you will probably have different levels of what is acceptable.

, Everyone will be able to see when you enter a chat room, so greet everyone with a friendly hello. If you join and stay silent, others may distrust you. The purpose of chat rooms is to engage with others, so make sure that you are contributing.


It is also polite, especially if you are actively participating in conversations, to say goodbye when you are leaving the chatroom. Other users will remember this and be more likely to be friendly towards you the next time that they see you.

, This is perceived as shouting by other readers, and is difficult to read. Save capitals for extreme emphasis, and don’t use them in every sentence., This is especially important in chat rooms with a lot of random people. Flooding means sending messages to the chat room one after the other in rapid succession. This keeps others from being able to start conversations, and you will be seen as a chat hog. Flooding a channel will most likely get you kicked.

, There are chat rooms for almost every interest in the world. This means that you are rebound to come across rooms that discuss or support topics you disagree with. Instead of attacking the members of that chat group, consider moving on to a new community. While good arguments are essential and important, especially for controversial topics, there is no point in trying to convince everyone to see things your way.

, There are a variety of common phrases and expressions that have been shortened for use in chats. These include classics such as LOL (laughing out loud), BRB (be right back), AFK (away from keyboard), AFAIK (as far as I know).Beyond these, each community may have its own shorthand that they have developed.


Always be sure that you know what the acronym means before you use it. Many reference bad language that could cause a reaction that you don’t want.
Make sure that your usage is appropriate for the situation. No one wants to read an “LOL” after saying that their friend is sick.

, In most casual chat situations, grammar is one of the least important things you have to worry about. If you are dealing with an academic or professional chat however, you will want to take the extra few seconds to ensure that what you type reads well and is error-free.


Base your grammar usage on the community around you. If you are constantly writing immaculate sentences but everyone else in the chatroom is using shorthand and doesn’t care about spelling, you may be singled out. Conversely, if everyone is typing thoughtfully, you will stick out if you don’t attempt to match the style.

, Unless you are using programs tied to your real identity, such as Facebook, choose a user name that masks your true identity. Avoid anything that could give clues to figuring out who you are. Use things such as hobbies or names derived from books or movies to help create an identity that you like while protecting your personal information.

, There are lots of shady people out there who will take whatever information they can from you and profit from it. Guard your personal information as closely as you would any valuable in a strange place.


Never give out your passwords to anyone, even if they say they work for the company running the chat. All companies can reset your password or access your account if necessary; none of them need you to give them your password. If anyone asks for your password, assume that they are going to do something malicious with it.
When using a webcam, make sure that there is nothing that can personally identify you in the image. People are surprisingly adept at tracking others down using the most innocuous clues. Hide any letters on your desk that may have your address, and make sure that your real name isn’t printed on something hanging on the wall behind you

, Many people use online chats to meet new people in real life, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Just be sure that when you do decide to meet someone, that you are doing so in a safe manner. People can pretend to be anything they want online, so make sure that you trust the person before meeting.


Always tell someone that you know that you are going to meet a person that you met online. Give them the details about where you are meeting and when you expect it to be over.
Always meet for the first time in a public place during the day. Never agree to a first meeting at your house or theirs.

, Even if no one is actively reading the logs, your messages and IP address are noted every time you post a message. These records could come back to haunt you if you find yourself doing illegal things while chatting. Always assume that someone else can read your chats, even if they’re marked private.

Obviously Instant Messaging wasn't invented for emergency use only, it was invented to keep in touch. Okay, so you say you enjoyed the movie, but don't go on and on about it.

You immediately think ""Ooh, I bought that great new CD,"" but your friend then types again-""I went to that new nightclub that opened."" You want to reply, but feel your friend has to finish what they started. Ask them more about the nightclub (or topic they brought up) and what was good and bad about it. Only ask this once, and be polite. Listen to your friend, and if they ask you stop asking questions or seem to be getting annoyed, stop.

, Your friend from class laughs at what you ate this morning. You ask why. They laugh again. Things may be annoying to them, but also to you. Explain that that's very annoying, and you'll block the contact if they take it any further.

, Your new buddy makes you smile, and laugh, maybe even cry. You type ""That's so cool!"" Okay, no big deal. Except every single letter is flashing and sparkly. This is extremely annoying. A few of these are okay, but don't overdo it.

Use Ctrl+Enter = a blank line.,
Respect brb and gtg.,
Know when the conversation ends.,
Ask if you can call.",How to Practice Instant Messaging Etiquette," Nothing is more annoying than to have your status as “Do Not Disturb,” only to be IM’d about a low priority project. Respect a person’s status!;
, If everyone would respect status messages, more people would use them when appropriate. If you’re really busy, set your status appropriately.

, This gives them the chance to explain that a project is underway, or to ask for 5 minutes to find a stopping point. This is the equivalent of knocking before you enter someone's office.

, If you're not close friends with the person, don't just send a greeting (""Hey there"") and expect them to launch a conversation. You should have a relevant question, or issue to discuss.

, Many people invite IMs from strangers, and it’s perfectly acceptable to send them one. However, be sure to explain (in your first message) who you are; a one-two sentence intro should suffice.

, Unless you know the recipient is on par with your IM savviness, keep abbreviations to a minimum. In fact, for regular IM sessions, it’s probably a good idea to avoid abbreviations that you wouldn’t use in regular emails or correspondence.

, Not everyone types at 200 WPM like you. Conversations get confusing when you type three separate thoughts before the other party can type a response to your first one.

, This relates to the previous point: be sequential, and one thought at a time.

, You’re not writing a dissertation, but incorrect grammar frustrates many people, and it confuses communication. Do your best to IM with decent grammar. Use the proper lower and uppercase letters. Do not type in all lowercase letters. Also, do not excessively pluralize words.

, Once again, try to be clear by using complete sentences. It’s not a hard-and-fast rule, but a good general guideline to follow.

, If you want the recipient to read several paragraphs of text, send an email. It’s incredibly hard to read a ton in IM, when the screen keeps scrolling because you’re not respecting the “one thing at a time” rule.

, a.k.a.: Don’t be too quick with the “Send” button. Make your messages be coherent thoughts, hopefully only one per message. This makes it easier to follow and respond in kind.

, If you have several quick things that you want in one message together, insert a blank line. In most clients, this is done with Ctrl+Enter.


Depending on your IM program, this might be Shift+Enter. Experiment to find out.
If you are using a Mac Client, the hotkey may be Option+Enter. Once again, experiment to find out.

, These mean, respectively, ”be right back” (brb) and ""got to go"" (gtg/g2g). These are two abbreviations that IMers should learn and respect. If someone types it, that means something is pulling them away from the message window. Halt your typing (or finish the thought, then type an “OK”), and wait for them to return. If you are the one typing brb be sure it is temporary; don't leave the other person waiting if you are not coming back any time soon. If you know you will be gone for a long time use gtg instead. If you are not coming back respect the other person's time and don't leave them hanging by overusing brb. An ideal replacement may be ""Be Back Later"".

, IM sessions aren’t clearly ended by hanging up. If the recipient answered your question, and you didn’t ask another, she likely considers the session over. If you need something else, ask. Otherwise, don’t be offended if you don’t receive “Thanks for the IM. Goodbye.” Likewise, if you've answered someone's question or you feel the conversation has come to a close, you can ask ""Is there anything else you want to go over?"" (or similar) and if there isn't, finish off with ""It was nice talking to you, thanks for writing. I'll catch you some other time!""

, If your conversation gets intense and typing becomes difficult, a phone call might help. Ask the recipient if they would prefer speaking over the phone and if calling is all right. It never hurts to ask. Internet voice chat is usually not ideal, but it might be a good idea if you are conversing with somebody you do not know outside of IM.

This is quite annoying. Spamming someone's inbox to get them to unblock you is pointless. They'll just block you for longer.

, Wait for at least a couple of minutes after they sign in before initiating a conversation, especially if this person has a slow computer, because it may take a couple of minutes to load.,,, Saying ""Hi,"" or ""What's up?"" with no real topic to talk about can get tedious.

, If it seems like he doesn't like chatting with you, you may not want to ask him out. However, if he is giving clues that maybe he likes you, you may consider asking him out.

, That way if you get a negative or weird reaction, you know not to ask him out at that time. Say something like ""You're really nice"" to see exactly how he responds. If you get anything like ""Um"" or ""Uh thanks."" then you might not want to ask him out. If you get a bad reaction say ""brb"" or ""g2g"" and leave him alone for a while.

Keep a simple design.,
Write up a short bio.,
Describe the type of work that you are looking for.,
List your professional skills.,
Include personal information.",How to Create an Online Portfolio1," Make your portfolio as straightforward as possible. Divide it into clear sections for your background, skills, and examples of your work. Clearly label the different sections so your readers immediately understand what they are looking at. Make it easy to navigate to the different sections. Your readers might give up if it’s too hard to find or identify the contents.Use a website template suited to your field. Look at the websites of the types of places you’re applying to and use the same type of design that you see on their websites.;
, Say who you are in a simple sentence. Add your resume or CV for more context. This is also where you should state the type of work you do or your degree if you’re fresh out of school. Talk about yourself in the third person if you want a formal portfolio, which is appropriate for certain fields, like corporate law, higher ed, or government. Use the first person if you’re aiming for a more casual, friendly tone.For example, start with your name and identify the type of work you do: “My name is Bob Smith. I am a freelance translator in Greensboro and I enjoy translating technical documents from Japanese and Korean.”
If you just received your degree, you can say: “Nancy Cohen recently graduated the Columbia University Computer Science Masters Program.”

, Include all areas in your field where you’re seeking employment. Also list any areas where you’d like to develop more professional experience. Specify where you’d like to work or if you’re looking for freelance opportunities.For example, you can say, “I love designing websites and am looking for more opportunities to work in coding on a freelance basis.”
Briefly state any conditions you’re willing to accept, like a flextime schedule, part-time work, if you’re willing to relocate, or if you’re willing to intern.

, Stay focused and only list skills that are relevant to the work you are seeking through your portfolio. Use technical language if that’s relevant. Don’t downplay your skillset -- you’re trying to convince your reader to hire you.

By donating money to them you can help support their efforts and expand their reach.Established nonprofit organizations typically provide many different methods for you to donate, whether you want to make a one-time donation or give the organization a little money each month.
Before you send money to an organization, use an external validation service to make sure the organization is legitimate and that your money will go to support efforts to defend net neutrality.
You can use any one of a number of charity evaluators online and run a search for reports by entering the name of the organization to which you want to donate.;
, Both nonprofit organizations and concerned individuals have created petitions that allow the public to band together and show their support for net neutrality. By signing these petitions you add your voice to the voices of others who defend net neutrality.You may be able to find petitions defending net neutrality at petition websites such as change.org. The White House also has a page where people can create and sign petitions.
By reading petitions and identifying the individuals or groups who started them, you also may find others to contact and network with to take further action to support your cause.
In addition to signing the petition, you also may have the option of signing up to a mailing list so you can receive updates and news about the status of the campaign and find out how the petition was received.

, Many nonprofit organizations and other grassroots leaders organize public events nationwide to raise awareness and send a message to lawmakers about the broad support for net neutrality.Nonprofit organizations and independent activists often use social media to spread the word about events and sign up participants.
You also may be able to find flyers for events on community bulletin boards, such as those often located at the public library or community center, or at universities.
Online meeting sites also have information about meetings in your area that you can sign up to attend or request an invitation from the event's organizers.

, The FCC, which regulates media and mass communications including the internet, allows public comments on regulations and other agency actions, as well as applications for mergers or acquisitions of media companies. You can file a comment using the agency's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) to express your support for net neutrality.To use the ECFS, simply choose a proceeding from the list provided on the FCC's ECFS website. You also can search for filings or proceedings that aren't listed.
Once you've found the proceeding for which you want to file a comment, click on the ECFS form to create your comment.
After you've finished, you have the opportunity to review and confirm your comment before you submit it. Once you submit your comment, you'll receive a confirmation number.
You can use your confirmation number to check the status of your comment at any time.
Keep in mind that comments are a matter of public record, so don't include any private, personal information.
In 2014, the FCC received more than 4 million public comments in favor of net neutrality, contributing to the decision to implement rules that would continue to protect net neutrality in the future.

, If there is pending legislation that threatens net neutrality, you can send letters to your elected representatives urging them to vote against the legislation and defend net neutrality.Contact information for your representatives is available on government websites. Typically you have the ability to search for the individual who represents you by entering your zip code.
Your letter can be as short as you want. If you're not confident about your own writing ability, you might want to use a script created by a nonprofit organization committed to defending net neutrality. You can always add a sentence or two to personalize the message.
If you want to write a longer, more personal letter, use the first paragraph to tell the member of congress a little about yourself and why the issue is so important to you.
Then explain the facts surrounding the bill or other action you're writing about and explain what you want the member of congress to do about it.
Close your letter by inviting the member of congress to contact you if he or she wants to discuss the matter further. Close with your signature and your preferred method of contact.

, In addition to sending written letters, you also may be able to sit down with your elected representative in person and ask him or her to pledge to defend net neutrality.Get the contact information for the representative's office scheduler. You call call the representative's home office in your state and get this information.
Contact the scheduler and request an appointment with the elected official. Don't be surprised if it takes several days or even weeks to get a response back. You may have to call or write the scheduler several times.
If the member of congress isn't available to talk to you, it may be possible for you to meet with a legislative staffer. If you have this opportunity, treat that person the same as you would the member of congress. He or she may be able to get you an in-person meeting with the member of congress when he or she is back in the district.

, Sending a letter to the editor can raise public awareness for net neutrality as well as send a message to government officials that their constituents care about a free and open internet.Check the newspaper's guidelines for submitting a letter. You may have to mail your letter or you may be able to send a letter online or through the newspaper's website.
Most newspapers have length and other formatting requirements, so make sure you follow them.
Try to reference current or recent events, and keep your tone professional and civil. Keep in mind that if the newspaper publishes your letter, it will be read by a wide variety of people – many of whom may not share the same values and interests as you, or may disagree with your point of view.
While many organizations have form letters you can use, it's best to make your letter as personal as possible and just use those letters as guides to make sure you hit the important points in your argument.

, You can write about net neutrality and various actions that threaten it yourself to raise awareness about these issues among the friends and family who follow you.If you're a strong writer and have a large online network of friends who follow your efforts, you may be able to raise awareness of net neutrality issues by creating your own content defending a free and open internet.
Consider focusing your efforts on a particular niche or group of people, and write posts discussing how their efforts and interests are advanced by net neutrality, or would be hurt if laws and regulations were passed that limited net neutrality.
Encourage those who support your blog or who follow your social media accounts to stand with you and fight to defend net neutrality by sharing your posts and telling others about your efforts.

, If you have the resources and ability, you may be able to help a nonprofit organization by working on an event in your area to increase public awareness for net neutrality issues.Working with an established nonprofit organization is perhaps the easiest way to organize an event, because the organization will have resources you can use and can help you get the word out about your event.
Organizing an event typically requires strong leadership skills and the ability to multi-task to cover all the bases and ensure your event stays on schedule.
You also will need a basic understanding of local laws and ordinances so you can make sure you've scheduled your event at an appropriate time and have all the permits you need for people to gather.
If you have a strong network of local support and believe you want to organize your own event, get together with a few leaders to evaluate the feasibility and set a plan in motion.

, Many nonprofit organizations that fight for net neutrality have weekly newsletters and other information that they send to their members, which can keep you up to date on any laws or other challenges threatening net neutrality.Typically when you donate to an organization you also have the option of becoming a member. Depending on how much you planned to donate, membership may be a slightly more expensive option, but the organization typically offers more benefits to members.
In addition to newsletters, you also may get gifts such as T-shirts or bumper stickers that you can use to advertise your dedication to defending net neutrality.
Some organizations also offer additional benefits for members, such as discounts on books or tickets to related events.

, Before you speak out against a regulation or piece of legislation that you've been told effects net neutrality, it's important to read it for yourself so you know exactly what it would do and how net neutrality would potentially be compromised.You can read the text of pending legislation and regulations on congressional and FCC websites.
Since sometimes these documents can be cumbersome to read, you also should seek out summaries of the important points to help you.
Organizations that defend net neutrality often produce documents about pending legislation called ""white papers"" and make these available on their websites free of charge.

, Most search engines allow you to set an alert so you will receive a notification whenever there are new results for a specific search. This can help you ensure that you know about any government actions affecting net neutrality as soon as possible.Since you typically have the ability to set multiple alerts, you can create new ones to monitor activity or news involving a specific regulation or bill, as well as broader searches that will capture any new information that concerns net neutrality.
If you're interested in updates from a specific organization, you can set up that organization's name or website as one of the filters in your search.
Search engines also allow you to specify how you will receive notifications of new search results, and how often you'd like to receive updates.

, Many of the organizations that defend net neutrality have accounts on social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter. Following these accounts not only helps you stay informed but also gives you an easy way to share information with others.In addition to sharing posts with your own network of friends or followers, you also can comment on the organization's posts and engage in conversations about net neutrality.
You also can browse the list of other users who follow the organization to find like-minded individuals you can connect with to help spread your own support network.

Don't try to argue back.,
Ask a person with more power to deal with him/her.",How to Defeat an Internet Troll," Often, just ignoring the troll will make him/her know that no one cares about his trying to pester, and will change the chat or lobby to annoy them.;
, If the chat has a mute/ignore option, use it. It can be quite helpful because it gets rid of the messages the troll sends.

, Trolls may often be truly strange, and will change the subject from e.g. ""Your dog is a noob."" to ""I think that plastic bag of yours was pathetic."". Trolls can't usually be predicted, but sometimes they can.

Review your data as it comes it.",How to Create an Online Survey1," There are many free survey sites, and though they come with limitations, they will work well for the majority of surveys. SurveyMonkey, TypeForm, Survey Gizmo, and many other sites offer free surveys. However, they do have restrictions, including:


Limited number of questions, usually 10-15.
Limited number of respondents allowed, usually 100-200.
Simple customization options or question types.

Google Forms is entirely free, and has none of the prior restrictions. It is, however, a bit more difficult to use for the uninitiated.;
, If you plan on reaching a wide audience, sending out a ton surveys, or asking more than 15 questions, you should get professional survey programs. Luckily, they are cheap and easy to use . You'll need to purchase a subscription (usually $20-25/month) to a site like SurveyMonkey, Client Heartbeat, and Survey Planet. Almost all these sites have free versions as well, so you can test them out beforehand. While features vary from service to service, paid sites generally allow:


Unlimited questions and respondents.
Statistical breakdowns of answers, often exportable to programs like Excel.
Ability to add pictures and logos to questions., You will need to create a username and password as well as fill in the pertinent information. Many of these companies allow you to make ""business accounts"" as well. If you need to share the information and surveys with coworkers, choose a generic username and password.

, Almost all survey sites allow you use a template, designed specifically for ""customer service,"" ""feedback,"" ""academic survey,"" or many other easy options. If you've never made a survey before, these could be good choices to get a hang of the structure and language.

, Let the reader know why you are asking questions, and what you plan on doing with the information. Assure them that their answers will be anonymous. People are much more likely to provide information if they know what their input will be helping fix or improve.


Be sure to thank them for helping. This may seem small, but it is a nice touch., These sites are made to make your work as easy as possible.


Choose your theme.
Start adding questions by clicking the ""Add Question"" button.

, Generally, you can choose ""single answer closed end,"" ""multiple answer closed end,"" or ""open-ended comment boxes."" You may have even more options with a paid service.



Single Answer means that, based on a range of options, the user picks one thing.

Multiple Answer means that the user ranks all the options, showing you their preferences.

Open-ended is a text box allowing the user to respond with any wording they want., If it is not an open-ended question, be sure to give all the possible options to your readers. You don't want people to quit or give inaccurate answers because they didn't find their exact choice. In the answer box, type out your answers on separate lines, which helps the software sort your answers.

, This lets you ""take"" the survey just as it looks to your respondents. When done, hit ""Exit This Survey"" to return to your editing page.

, When you're done, hit ""Publish Survey."" This brings up links to share the survey, usually a link or email button that lets you send it to other people. Send the survey to as many people as possible, and attach a short paragraph asking them politely to take the survey. The more people take the survey, the more accurate your data will be.

, Now that survey information is starting to flow in you have some data to work with, and you can check it on the site at any time. You don't want to make any assumptions until you have a lot of data already collected, as surveys with only 5-6 respondents are generally inaccurate. While the number of respondents needed to call the survey successful depends on the situation, you shouldn't make any guesses until you have most of your expected replies in.

Make sure all possible answers are discrete.,
Use structured questions when you have a good idea what information you need.,
Use rating or ranking questions to get more data on each option.,
Use open-ended questions in order to gain new insights, ideas, and feedback.",How to Create an Online Survey2," If you confuse your readers you're not going to get useful information from the survey. Steer away from technical jargon or large vocabulary words, double negatives (""Would you never consider not buying our product?""), and make sure your grammar and spelling are perfect. The simpler it is to read the question, the easier it will be to give a useful answer.


""How would you improve the robust genre filtering system?"" is much too wordy. Instead, ask, ""Is there any way to make searching for music easier?"" You'll get more honest, direct answers without confusion., While you want to be simple and direct, you don't want to be so simple that you don't get the types of answers you want. For example, instead of asking, ""How likely would you be to sign up for MeMusic service?"" give the reader an idea of what the service is while still keeping it short:


""MeMusic examines your current music collection and then makes radio stations based on your favorites. Based on this description, how likely would you be to pay for MeMusic?""
""MeMusic is considering a new feature that shares your stations with friends. Would you pay extra for such a service?"", Asking ""how much do you love MeMusic?"" suggests to readers that they love the service already. While these answers are good to hear, they don't give you as much useful information. Instead, aim for neutral wording. Try out something like, ""How satisfied are you with the MeMusic service?""


Never hedge your questions with filler like, ""we're very proud of our customer service team. Have you enjoyed them too?"" Get right to the question.
Don't make one option stand out. For example, when asking a Yes/No question, don't make one of the options ""Definitely!"" and the other ""No."" This may bias your reader., Discrete means that they only lead to one potential outcome. This is easiest to see with an example. You might ask, ""do coaches and players enjoy the new field, yes or no?"" But the answers wouldn't help you. A yes could mean the coaches enjoy it, the players enjoy it, or they both enjoy it. With just one question you couldn't tell which of the three options they mean.


Only ask one thing at a time. Make ""Was the program easy and fun to use?"" two separate questions about ease and enjoyment., Structured questions are when the user can only pick a set number of answers, like a multiple choice question. They are best for times when you need specific feedback, not new ideas or suggestions. They are also much easier to analyze, as you can see the response as numbers (how many chose each answer) as opposed to reading each paragraph. When designing structured questions:


Only offer the choices you want feedback on. Do not give so many options that the question is overwhelming to a reader.
Avoid overlap. If you're asking how much money someone would spend a month, don't write ""$0-25"" and ""$25-50."" What if they want exactly $25? Make the second ""$26-50.""
Cover all alternatives. If the topic is broad, make an option ""Other."" Many surveys include a bar next to other so someone could input their off-beat option., Rating questions allow a reader to order the options, into their first, second, third choice, etc. This is helpful when trying to find overlap or choose between multiple good ideas. For example, you may be planning the theme for a party, and give the options ""Beach,"" ""Space,"" and ""Old West."" Say you do a normal survey and everyone picks Old West. But when you get to the party store, they're all out of cowboy decorations. A ranking question would let you see everyone's number two option.


This can also help if you need to make one choice that appeals to everyone. For example, Half the people might have put Old West last in their rankings. Even though it ""won"" the most votes, you could make more people happy by choosing the universally popular second choice., An open question is simply when you ask something, then provide a blank box for the reader to add their input. When designing open-ended questions, try and keep the prompt short. You want quick, easily read answers, not long and broad answers that are tough to differentiate.


Remember to only ask one thing at a time. Don't ask ""what are our best and worst features"" in one question. Make it to.
Sometimes, however, a wide-open question like ""is there anything else you'd like to tell us,"" is a great way to end a survey and find new information you may have missed."

Know that your searching may not be fruitful.",How to Google a Person1," Search the person's first name and last name as a single search term within double quotation marks: e.g. ""John Smith"". If the name is a somewhat common one, many irrelevant results will show up. To filter these results, try including a middle initial or middle name with your original search: ""John A. Smith"" or ""John Andrew Smith"".;
, If you're Googling someone, you likely know something about him/her besides the name. Perhaps you know the name of the company the person works for. Perhaps you know names of family members. Perhaps you know activities or hobbies, schools or churches. Most often, you will know their general geographic location (city/state). Think of where you met the person or how you know the person, and include one or two of these elements in your search.


For example, you met John Smith on an elevator in ABC Corporate Building. You would Google ""John Smith"" and ""ABC"" in the same search bar.
Or perhaps John Smith's boy Greg plays soccer for nearby Allentown High. Google ""Greg Smith"" ""soccer"" or ""Greg Smith"" ""Allentown"" to find information about Greg.

, The other way to strike gold is to find the person's online pseudonym and Google that. Pseudonyms might include nicknames, screen-names, pen-names, business names, or known aliases. This can often pull up more information than Googling the person's name. Of course, this approach doesn't work if the person has created a separate pseudonym for each site or account. Few people are that privacy-savvy, though.

, There are a few people left who just don't put themselves online. You will Google these people largely in vain. You might find their name mentioned briefly in an article written by a colleague, or you might see their name in a long list of other participants in some community event. Don't discount the information gathered this way – it can still be very helpful. However, it may not be as useful as information that the person posts about himself or herself.

Try using sites beyond Google.,
Find a ""People Search Engine"".,
Try using Whitepages.com This site brings up people with names similar to the one you're looking for, sorted by state.",How to Google a Person2," Google can be great for bringing up someone's searchable information – but it doesn't always get you what you need. The Internet is full of people-searching websites, some of which can even pull up public records. If you need less-public information, such as phone numbers, addresses, marriage and criminal records, you may need to use a more advanced search tool.


Beware of sites that ask you to pay. There are free sites and for-profit sites – some of which descend into outright scamming.

, Simply entering someone's name into Google will likely give you too many results, so there are a number of sites dedicated to People Search. Some work better than others. You can find a listing of people-searching tools at The Search Engine List. Visit Finding-People.com for more links to online people-search tools.



Yahoo People Search is another tool to try, although its functionality is very basic.
If all else fails, try zabasearch. This will turn up every single phone number, address, and person with a similar name going back decades!

, Whitepages.com can be both helpful and confounding, as it often contains duplicate results. This can be frustrating when you're trying to pin down which John Smith lives in Allentown – but it can be helpful if you happen to know that John Smith used to live in Indiana and now lives in Pennsylvania. Then, you can use the duplicate records to your advantage.


Whitepages.com also often gives names of people closely related to the one being searched. This gives you more keywords to search, more opportunities of finding the information you want.

Consider tracking someone down on social media.,
Consider how much energy you want to put into this.,
Follow social media trails.",How to Google a Person3," Social media sites are a mixed bag. If you can find the person's social media accounts (and they're not protected), you've struck gold. However, many people do protect their social media accounts, either through privacy settings or through pseudonyms. Finding someone on Facebook is a good place to start.


If the person was an adolescent in the early 2000s, see if his/her Xanga or Myspace is still online. Several of these sites have few privacy settings and can provide a wealth of information.

, Sometimes a manual approach works (e.g. searching Facebook for ""John Smith"" and scrolling through all 500 results until you find one whose profile picture matches your memory of his face). Often, however, this is more tedious than it's worth.

, If you are able to find someone's Facebook page, you may be able to find a link to their Instagram, or their Twitter, or their professional portfolio. If you are able to find a tagged photo of a person on someone else's social media page, then you may be able to follow this clue to the person's profile. Look for any information that might be useful: a person's hometown, birthday, past employment, associates, etc.

Enter a name that you will remember, like “PC Authenticator” or “WinAuth.” When you are done, click the blue “Generate” button on the right hand side.
A new window should pop up in the middle of your screen. Inside of this window there should be a yellow box with a bunch of random lowercase letters inside it. This is a secret code that you will now need to remember or write down because you will only use it once. It will grant WinAuth full access to your Google account. Copy this code by highlighting it, right-clicking, and selecting “Copy” from the context menu. Keep this window open until you finish the next step, just in case there is any mistake. You will not see this password again.
Return to the WinAuth program and paste your password in the input box next to “Step 1.” Then click the “Verify Authenticator” button in “Step 2.” If the password is correct, “Step 3” will change on its own. There will be a random 6-digit code that will appear inside of a box, with a green loading bar moving under it. Everytime the green bar fills and restarts, the code should change. Click “OK” to continue.

, Authenticators are powerful tools created to keep your personal information secure, so this step should make some kind of crazy sense. A new window will open with a password field in it, followed with a verification field. Enter a password that you will remember for sure in these fields. In addition to the password, you can also encrypt the files inside WinAuth to only be usable on the current PC. You can even narrow it down to the current user only having access. Simply check one, or both, of the checkboxes below. For now, just set a password, as this can be changed later, then hit “Okay.”


Please make sure to remember to write down this password, and don’t forget it. If you do forget it, you cannot recover your account.

, From now on, when you run WinAuth, you should be greeted by a password screen. Enter the password you created above. You should see the big metal G icon inside WinAuth after you enter your password. To the right of it should be a light blue refresh circular arrow. Click this to generate a 2-step code for any device or account requiring your Google Authenticator. Remember though that the code will disappear after 15 seconds or so. Enjoy!

Test mobile device screens using desktop software.",How to Use Google to Shrink Websites for Mobile Viewing," Weblight is an algorithm created by Google to provide users with faster and lighter page loads when in poor network conditions. This means that Weblight has no user interface and operates on the backend. Pages are stripped of their more complex elements, providing a stripped-down, lightweight experience, rather than one explicitly optimized for the mobile platform.;
, On your mobile device, simply append your full site URL to the end of the weblight address (e.g. if your website is ""mywebsite.com"" then you enter http://googleweblight.com/?lite_url=http://mywebsite.com). The page will load a simplified but functional version of itself. With the removed elements, some sites may appear much better on mobile device screens.

, Keep in mind that this is not an explicit converter tool designed for user interaction. While manually entering the website can be used in a pinch, Weblight is designed for speed, not usability.

, Mobile devices share a few aspects that make them distinct from their desktop counterparts. These core features should be the main considerations when creating a site for mobile consumption.


Small screens and verticality: Although screen resolutions on mobile devices are constantly improving, the size and form factor remains a concern for site design. Designing a site into a single column layout is best for phones (tablets can often use desktop sites without too much issue).
Touch interfaces: Page elements should be placed with the size of a finger in mind. Elements that utilize mouseover should be minimized or redesigned for touch (e.g. dropdown menus).
Data speeds: One of the great advantages of mobile devices is usage outside of wifi range, but data connections are typically slower and less reliable. User interfaces (UI) should remain simple and content should be visible and accessible. Too much clutter will bog down load times and make navigation difficult.

, For those developing with fewer resources, using a CMS service like Wordpress or Squarespace is a great options for low-cost, user-friendly mobile design. Themes that utilize responsive web design will provide the easiest template for a mobile site.


Responsive web design is a theory of web design that promotes the use of fluid design elements to allow smooth transitions of design and usability across platforms.

, There are a number of free web applications that allow you to emulate mobile devices to test website aesthetics and functionality. Using these tools is as easy as selecting the desired test device, then entering to target website to preview. Most will include tools for variables like screen orientation, pixel density, or even browser selection. A few popular examples are:

Tapping it will place a marker on your starting point, anchoring your ""ruler"" in place., Try to place the crosshair in a way that makes the projected line between the last point and your crosshair as straight as possible., This will plant a second marker and draw a line between the two points; you should see a measurement number hovering above this line.MeasureIt's measurements can be displayed in a variety of units, from centimeters to feet.

, This will undo your last action; for example, if you anchored two points and one was incorrectly placed, tapping this arrow will undo the last anchor.

Tap the ""undo"" arrow multiple times to undo multiple actions.

, Projected volume is a way to measure how much space a two-dimensional geometric shape (e.g., a square) would take up if it were made three-dimensional; this feature is useful for measuring out cabinet space or something similar (e.g., how far a TV will stick out into a room if it is mounted on a wall). To do this, you will need to do a couple of things:

Place a minimum of three connected points over an area. All of the points must be connected to one another to form a geometric shape.
Tap and hold the ""A"" in the middle of the shape.
Walk backwards--or move the phone--until the shape pulls away from the wall. You should see lines portraying the distance between the wall and the end of your shape that's closest to you. Pull the shape as far out from the wall as you wish to measure.

, This should be on one of the edges of your phone's screen. Tapping the camera will take a screenshot of your measurements for future reference., You can use your screenshots of measurements to build blueprints, calculate repairs, and more., This will open your sidebar menu, from which you can change your settings and access your gallery., This will open the measurements gallery menu., This will open your picture in full-screen mode., The gallery will display the picture as it appeared on your phone's screen when you took it, plus a simple schematic of what you were photographing.

The schematic is particularly helpful if you're taking pictures of volume measurements.

, This will open a menu with an option to download the screenshot.

Depending on your model of Tango device and version of MeasureIt, you may have more options available.

This free, open-source program can sync your two calendars so that changes in one appear in the other.

This method only works on Windows computers.

,,, This depends on your browser's security settings., The program should only take a few seconds to download. You'll see it at the bottom of your browser, or you can find it in your Downloads folder.,, You may be prompted by Outlook to allow access. This may not happen with newer versions.,,, If you only have one calendar, it will be Default Calendar.,, A web browser window will open., Log into your account in the browser window that just opened., This will give Outlook Google Calendar Sync the ability to edit your calendar events, but it will not have your Google account password., The code may scroll beyond the field., You can press Ctrl+C or right-click the selection and click ""Copy."", This window appeared once you clicked Retrieve Calendars.,,, You can only choose one Google calendar per account, so make sure you consolidate your events if you have them spread across multiple calendars.,,, This will set Outlook Google Calendar Sync to sync you calendar information to both of your calendars, so that they are always the same regardless of where you enter events., This determines how often your Outlook calendar will update with information from your Google calendar.

If the value is set to 0, you'll have to manually sync your calendars.

, This will update your Google calendar within a few minutes of changes being made in Outlook., These are not included in the sync by default., Checking the following boxes will ensure that Outlook Google Calendar Sync is always running in the background and keeping you calendars up to date:

Start on login
Start in tray
Minimise to tray instead of taskbar
Close button minimises window instead of terminating application

,,, The sync will begin and you'll see the details in the readout. If you have a lot of events, it may take a while to finish., Your events should now be appearing in both your Google calendar and your Outlook calendar. When you make a change to one, it will be updated on the other when you sync next.

Syncing will happen automatically according to the sync interval you set earlier.

, Once you finish logging in, you will have to navigate back to Google Hangouts.


If you already have an account logged in, this step is not necessary.

, If you don't have one yet, search for your contact then start a new chat.

,, The output will show: (User) rolls a die and gets (result).

, Roll 2 dice by typing in /roll 2dice or /roll 2 dice. A simplified alternative to this is /roll 2d. Send the message.


An array will follow, showing the results of each dice. An array can show dice results up to 99 dice.
By default, Google will assume that the dice are six-sided if the number of sides is not specified.

Example 1a: /roll 2d --> User rolls 2d and gets 4. Example 1b: /roll 2 dice --> User rolls 2 dice and gets 9. , Roll 2 eight-sided dice by typing /roll 2d8. Send the message.



Example 2: /roll 2d8 --> User rolls 2d8 and gets 12. , Try typing in /roll 5d10 or /roll 8d4. Send the message. Keep rolling the same thing and notice how the results are different.



Example 3a: /roll 5d10 --> User rolls 5d10 and gets 24. Example 3b: /roll 5d10 --> User rolls 5d10 and gets 28. Example 4a: /roll 8d4 --> User rolls 8d4 and gets 23. Example 4b: /roll 8d4 --> User rolls 8d4 and gets 18. , Google also gives the option of rolling 2-sided and 3-sided dice. Obviously, dice have never been 2-sided or 3-sided before. Only coins and spinners can equate to these types of dice. Rolling 9d2 is equivalent to tossing a coin 9 times.



Example 5: /roll 9d2 --> User rolls 9d2 and gets 12. Example 6: /roll 5d3 --> User rolls 5d3 and gets 10. , You can try adding +2 or -2 at the end of the text. By typing /roll 2d6+5, Google will output (User) rolls 2d6+5 and gets (result). As before, an array displaying the results will follow along with the constant factor. The constant will be outside the array.



Example 7: /roll 1d6+8 --> User rolls 1d6+8 and gets 10. + 8


Example 8: /roll 8d12-18 --> User rolls 8d12-18 and gets 42. - 18


, Typing anything out of order will confuse Google with the exception of rolling a barrel. Typing /roll barrel opens up a YouTube video in a new tab. Rolling one-sided dice won't confuse Google but will use an excuse about not able to ""find any double-headed coins"".

, You will see an overview of the types of results you will receive beneath the search box. If the results don't look exactly like what you want, try some of these searching tips.



Using Quotes: Use quotes to search for whole phrases instead of individual words. For example, if you want to get results about a movie titled, The Boy in the House, enclose it with quotes. Be sure that the words within the quotes are in the correct order. If you use quotes, the results will only include the exact phrase

Using the minus symbol: Use the minus symbol to exclude certain words from your search result. This is especially helpful if you need to remove words from a search term with multiple meanings. If you want to get alerts about the Puma clothing brand but not the animal, enter in -animal to exclude all results about the puma animal.

If you want to exclude results from a specific site, enter in -site: sitename .



Using an asterisk: Use the asterisk as a placeholder for unknown words. For example, if you wish to find results about different things a city is doing to its citizens, you could enter in this search: ""New York * citizens"" . Any phrase that starts with New York and ends with citizens will be returned.

Using OR operator: Use the word, OR to get results that contain any one of your search terms. For example, if you searched, Australia OR prison OR systems, you would get results with pages that may only include one of the search words.

, Click the More options link beneath the search box. Then, click the dropdown menu to the right of Source. You can choose as many options as you would like to include by clicking. A checkmark will appear by selected sources.



Automatic: Will show you the results that contain the best results, regardless of the source.

Blogs: Will only return results from blogs. Blogs aren't always the best way to get the most reliable information, but it will help if you want to gauge the feeling that the online community has toward a subject.

News: Will return results from sites such as the New York Times and the Washington Post. This is a good source to include if you are monitoring an ongoing event or story.

Web: Will deliver results from all across the web, such as forums and other online communities.

Video: Will return video results.

Books: Will return any new books related to your search term. You will likely receive fewer results as books aren't as commonly released as other sources.

Discussions: Will return results from forums and other online communities.

Finance Will return results from the finance world. This is a very useful source if you are trying to monitor how a certain product or company is doing in the marketplace.

, Click the More options link beneath the search box. Then, click the dropdown menu to the right of How often.



As-it-happens: Google will send alerts to your e-mail with new content related to your search term right as it happens. This is extremely useful if you need to receive up-to-date news on a continuing story or event. However, it will result in a large number of e-mails.

At most once a day: Google will send you an alert with a summary of new content related to your search term once a day. If your search term is fairly obscure and not much is happening with it, you may not receive an alert on some days.

At most once a week: Google will send you an alert with a summary of new content related to your search term once a week. This is a good option if your search term is somewhat obscure and new information on it is not released frequently.

, Then, click the dropdown menu to the right of How many. If you choose All results, you will receive any new information related to the search term even if the information is of low-quality. This is useful if you want to get a good feeling for the reaction to an event online.

, Click the More options link beneath the search box. Then, click the dropdown menu to the right of Region. This option will allow you to filter results by almost any region in the world.

, Click the More options link beneath the search box. Then, click the dropdown menu to the right of Deliver to. You can choose between your e-mail address or an RSS feed. If you do not know what an RSS feed is, read our article about how to set an RSS feed up.

, After you have made all your choices and the results preview is to your satisfaction, click Create Alert. You will now receive alerts to either your e-mail address or your RSS feed.

","How to Play the ""No Results"" Google Prank"," This could be anything from ""linux"" to ""real estate"". It doesn't have to be extremely popular, just common enough that there will be quite a few listings.

, For example, perhaps you'd like to get PDFs that explain what Android is and can do. PDFs are often a good choice because they may include articles, instructions, diagrams, and the like and can be easily downloaded for keeping.

, For the query used here, for example:


Type in the file type as: File Type:

Add the file type: File Type:PDF

Add the query: File Type:PDF What is Android?


, You'll then receive a bunch of returns focused on PDFs only, that should address at least some of your search query in the PDF contents.

, You can search for any specific file format using this trick.

Realize that you're one of maybe only ten thousand people in the entire world who has this futuristic technology.,
Avoid wearing Glass when you don't want attention.,
Realize that when someone first notices Glass on your face, one of five things will happen:


They will glare at you and not say a word.,
Decide how to respond.,
Offer for them to try it on, if you're comfortable with that.,
Give demos when you're willing.,
Be patient with those who insist that you're recording them.,
Put them away if need be.,
Feel awesome that you likely just made someone's day (if not week).","How to Not Be a ""Glasshole"""," You will get attention. You essentially agreed to this being OK by paying $1600 for the privilege.;
, If the B-list celebrity status bothers you for some reason, don't wear Glass in public.

, This can either be because they think you have a medical condition or they're way too nervous to approach you and ask you about it.
They'll try to discreetly whisper to their friend that you're wearing Google Glass. The friend will likely not know what the heck they're talking about and then begin to point to the side of their temple as they attempt to explain what this Star Trek gadget does. You continue to pretend like you don't notice them talking about you.
If they're more of the social type, they'll come right up to you and ask ""What's up with your glasses?"" or ""What are you wearing on your face?""
Then there are times when people know exactly what Glass is and proceed to react as if they've literally seen all of their favorite celebrities at once (or play it off with a hipster-like ""Ya, I've seen those before. Cool, man."").
Finally, there are those that ask you stop recording them.

, Most situations just call for being friendly and smiling! (Not that you shouldn't always be doing this).


Approach the curious party, tell them ""I'm wearing Google Glass. It's a way for me to see important information like emails, tweets, sports scores, and news headlines without having to pull out my phone. I can also have Scotty beam me up to the Enterprise.""

, Enable Guest mode and show them that Glass doesn't just record videos. If they need some help using Glass, use the MyGlass app on your phone to help them - it now has the ability to remotely control Glass.


Use common judgement when allowing people to try it on.

, For those that treat you like teenage girls react to Justin Bieber.....well these encounters are plain fun. Just try not to roll your eyes when they ask ""Does it actually work?"" Answer any of their questions, let them try on Glass, but don't let them kidnap you. If you have the time, a solid 5, maybe 10 minutes is a fair amount of time to demo Glass for them.

, Kindly reply that you are not recording them. Show them that if you were recording them, the screen would be on and clearly visible. Open the MyGlass app and show them what you're seeing. Ask if they would like to try Glass on for themselves, and mention how Glass is mainly intended to be a heads up display for important notifications, not a life-streaming video camera. The battery would only last 30 minutes anyway, if you did nothing but record video.

, If the person insists that you stop recording them, no matter what you say, kindly oblige and make use of that fancy cloth case that Google provided to you. No use in getting into some argument over something trivial like this. Besides, they'll see the light in a year or so from now!

, You are an ambassador of the future, sent forth by Google to show people that they no longer have to glare down at their phones to tweet or Instagram their lunch!

Define your goals.,
Refine how you organize your advertising campaign(s).,
Think of specific keywords related to what you want to advertise.,
Choose several placements for your ads.,
Separate your keywords and placements into groups for different ads.,
Create attractive ads that are clear and simple.,
Experiment with the different ads in each ad group.,
Prepare a relevant landing page for each ad.",How to Optimize Google AdWords," Plan what you want to achieve with your ads, such as getting more clicks or a higher return on investment.;
, By creating a detailed organizational structure, you can better focus on what areas need improvement in your ad content and placement.


Separate multiple campaigns by topic, such as brands or products.
Select relevant languages and geographical locations for your advertising. If you only do business within a limited area, for example, you can narrow your advertising target by country, territory, region or city.

, The keywords should be words or phrases that people would use to search for your product or service.


Consider including singular and plural forms of the words, synonyms or other relevant ways to find your product or service, such as product model numbers.
Google has a Keyword Tool you can use to help generate keywords for your ads.

, These would be relevant websites or parts of websites that target the people most likely to be interested in your ads. Google has a Display Network that has a collection of websites it uses to show AdWords ads.


Google offers automatic placements and managed placements for ads. Automatic placements use keywords associated with your ads to place them for you on the Display Network. Managed placements do not require keywords and give you more control over your ads' placement, such as by letting you decide which websites cannot show your ads.
Use specific URLs, selected demographics, or topics you have described or browsed through to choose your placements.
You can also use Google's Placement Tool to find and choose websites for your ads. Check the ""Ad Formats"" column when using the tool to make sure your potential placements accept your type of ad, which may be text only, image only, video and text, etc.

, Use these groups to help organize the ads you create. Each ad group can focus on a particular product or service, such as a model of a general product line.

,


Use keywords in an ad's title and text to demonstrate that your ad relates to what people are searching for. This is good for ads relying on keyword-targeting.
Include unique features of your product, service or business that set you apart from your competitors. Mention any special promotions you are having.
Write a strong call-to-action as a next step for people to take after seeing and clicking your ad. Examples are ""Buy,"" ""Get a quote,"" ""Call,"" etc.

,


Google will rotate ads in an ad group automatically and display the better-performing ad(s) more frequently.
Use different ad content, such as offers or call-to-action phrases, to find which ads are most effective for reaching your advertising goals.

, A landing page is a webpage that people are directed to after clicking on an ad. Each landing page should be specific and relevant to what was advertised in its associated ad.
