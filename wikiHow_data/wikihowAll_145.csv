Download the latest version of 51degrees.mobi’s Java API from SourceForge and unzip the file in a location of your choosing.,
Change the ""FORCE_SINGLE_PROCESSOR"" value to ""true"" in src/fiftyone/mobile/detection/Constants.java and recompile the jar file (more detailed instructions can be found here).

Add code inside the “doPost” method to use the Provider Object’s “getDeviceInfo()” method to get the connecting devices information.",How to Implement Device Detection in Google App Engine Using 51Degrees.Mobi," You will then need to make some modifications to the source code to stop 51Degrees.mobi implementing multi-threading. This is because by default 51Degrees.mobi implements multi-threading to speed up the device detection. This is achieved by each Provider Object creating a thread pool and using it during the matching section of our solution. However, Google App Engine does not allow a program to create thread pools or additional threads without using their specific API (more information can be found here under the “Threads” Section.);
,,


The modifications that need to be made to the existing guest book application are in the “SignGuestbookServlet.java” and “Guestbook.jsp”. In “SignGuestbookServlet.java” you need to override the “init()” and “destroy()” methods of the Servlet Interface to include the creation and destruction of a 51Degrees.mobi Provider Object. This is because the Provider Object only needs to be created and destroyed once in the lifetime of the servlet, and the creation and destruction are controlled by these methods respectively:

, This method takes the User Agent string as a parameter and will return a 51Degrees.mobi BaseDeviceInfo Object which holds the device properties. Then, the “IsMobile” property is examined to determine whether the device is mobile or not and the result is added as a greeting property.

, Synchronizing multiple computers and devices with a Dropbox account helps you quickly share data, but synchronizing automatically may also raise risks to security issues. You can check the device or computer that are no longer used and interrupt synchronization features for those devices to prevent leakage of unwanted data.


To do this, also on Security tab, you will be listed computers and devices connected to your Dropbox account. Then you click on “Unlink” at the back to interrupt link device.

, In addition to the two above precautions, monitoring any changes in your account is also a way to keep your Dropbox account safe.


To activate this feature, on the Security tab you double-check in the Notification to see if there are the two check marks. This means that you will receive an email of notification whenever a new application or device is connected to your account.

, If you use many synchronizing services as well as social networks then you may occasionally link your Dropbox account with these services to backup or transfer files in a quicker way than uploading. Linking these applications will require full access to your Dropbox account, and they will still keep the access rights even if you stop using the service.


Therefore if there is a flaw or your account happens to be stolen, this means the data on your Dropbox account, which you used to link, also contains a number of risks.
To revoke an application's access to your Dropbox account, click on the tab My Dropbox app on the Account Settings page. Click on the X next to the applications you do not use.

, Use a separate password for your Dropbox account such as adding the word ‘dropbox’ in your password, common cipher text or using an application or service password-encryption to protect Dropbox account your password if unfortunately the password in your service is exposed.


Another solution is to change your password regularly. This way you can also apply to other security ways. Due to the password change, the range of services, applications and connected device will stop linking, and you can review the one that you need to hold. You can use the Change password link on the Security tab to change the Dropbox account’s password.

, All these security precautions will not help you if Dropbox does not guarantee the safety of your account, or if someone else gained access to your telephone, equipment or your computer that link with Dropbox. To protect yourself and ensure that your sensitive files remain secure, you can encrypt your files stored in your Dropbox account.


To access the encrypted files, you will need to know the encryption password. Dropbox itself does not provide any solutions to encrypt your files, but there are several ways to do it thanks to a number of third-party applications like TrueCrypt, BoxCryptor or EncFS.

To upload a photo, tap each photo you wish to upload, tap Next in the top-right corner of the screen, and then tap Upload.
To create a file, tap an app (e.g., Microsoft Word) and then proceed with creating the file.

, Once this process is complete, you can open Dropbox on your computer to view and print your files., If you have the Dropbox app installed on your computer, you can simply open the Dropbox folder.

If you don't have Dropbox on your computer, go to Dropbox's website at https://www.dropbox.com/ and sign in with your email address and password.
To locate Dropbox on your computer, type dropbox into Spotlight (Mac) or the Start menu's search bar (Windows), then click the appropriately named folder.

, To do this, you may either hold down ⌘ Command (or Ctrl on PC) while clicking individual files, or you can click and drag your mouse cursor across files to select them.

If you're on the Dropbox website, you'll first download files by clicking the box on the left side of each item's bar to select your files and then clicking Download on the right side of the page, then view those files by double-clicking the downloaded folder on your computer's desktop or in your computer's ""Downloads"" folder.

, Doing so will invoke a drop-down menu.

If you downloaded files from the Dropbox website on a PC, you'll first need to drag your selected files out of the downloaded folder since the folder's compression won't allow you to print them from within it.

, Doing this will bring up your computer's ""Print"" window, wherein you can select a printer and then proceed with printing your documents.

If you don't see this option, try two-finger clicking (or right-clicking) a different selected file.

, In the ""Printer"" box, you should see the name of a printer to which your computer is connected. You can click this box to view all available printers and, if necessary, select a new one.

If you need to attach your computer to your printer manually via cable, first do so.

, Things like color printing versus black-and-white, photos' sizes, and orientation (e.g., vertical or horizontal) will change the way your files appear when you print them, so making sure that all of your settings on this page are ideal will ensure that you don't end up wasting paper.

For example, if you want to print your files double-sided, check the appropriate box.

, You'll see this option at the bottom of the page. Your Dropbox files should begin printing in your desired format."

, If you already have existing folders, navigate through all your folders and sub-folders until you reach the level where you want to create the new folder.


Navigation can be done by clicking on the folder names.

, Once you’re on the right location, create a new folder. Click on the “New” button found on the All Files page header menu, and select “New Folder” from the pop-up.

, In the Create New Folder window, type in the folder name in the appropriate field.

, Under the Collaboration radio buttons, determine if the folder will be for your own personal use or for collaboration and sharing.


If it’s for personal use, tick “Keep private for now.”
If it’s for collaboration, tick “Invite people to upload or download files” and then list the names or e-mail addresses of all collaborators.
Click on “Okay” once you’re done.

, Repeat steps 2 to 5 as needed to complete your Box directory structure.


Since you’re technically starting over, it would be a good time to organize your files and folders directory. Visualize how you would like your Box to look like, and create the necessary folders to follow that vision.

, If you’ve gone through part 1 quickly and didn’t really have the time to validate the collaboration settings of your folders, do it now. In step 5 of part 1, the collaboration type was set for each folder. This needs to be reviewed to ensure all folders that will require collaboration are properly set and shared.

, Click on a folder name to enter it. Once inside, locate the header menu and click on “More.” Select “Properties,” then “Security.” The Folder Properties with the Security tab opened will be launched.

, The first security setting allows you to define who can invite collaborators and who can view the collaborators.


Tick the first option if you will only allow the folder owners to extend share invites.
Tick the second option if you want all collaborators to remain anonymous to each other.

, The second security setting defines the access level or membership of people who has the share link. If this option is enabled, anyone who has the share link can access the folder, even if they aren’t collaborators or even Box users.

, The third and last security setting sets how the access via shared links will work. If the “Restriction within collaborators only” is set, only those set as collaborators for the folder can access the folder. Anyone who is not a collaborator cannot access it, even if he has the shared links.

, Once done, click on the “Save” button.


Repeat part 2 for all the folders, especially those that will need sharing access.

, If you don’t have Dropbox locally available on your computer, you will need to individually download everything from Dropbox. Store them locally into their organized and proper folder structure for easier reference and retrieval.

, Go to each of the folders and sub-folders you’ve created in part 1. Upload all the relevant files to the proper folder. Uploading can be done by selecting the files and dragging them to the browser with the proper Box folder location already opened.


Each upload will have its respective progress or status bar for your reference.
Once you’re done with one folder, move on to the next until you’ve uploaded everything.

, If you don’t like the idea of working and uploading in batches, you can upload everything at once to a temporary Box folder. Go to the main All Files page in Box and create a new temporary folder.


Open the temporary folder.
Select all the files you’re uploading and drag them to the browser with the temporary folder opened.
Wait for the upload to finish. Since there are a lot of files, uploading may take some time.
Skip this step if you’ve already uploaded everything from step 2.

, Skip this step if you’ve already uploaded everything from step 2 in their proper locations; otherwise, proceed with reorganizing your files into their proper folders.


From step 3, since you’ve just put everything in one place, you have to go through all the files one by one and move them to their proper folders.
Select a file and click on the paper icon from the action menu. The Move/Copy Selected Item window will appear.
Type in the folder name or navigate through your folders until you find the proper destination folder.
Select the folder and click the “Move” button.
Repeat this step for all your files.

, From the main page, notice the header menu at the top. Locate the third icon from the left with the folder icon. Click on this to go to the All Files page. This is your main page for all your Box folders and files.

, Navigate through all your folders and sub-folders until you reach the folder you want to share.


Navigation can be done by clicking on the folder names.

, From the header menu, find the “More” button and click on it. Select “Share,” then “Invite Collaborators.” The Invite window will appear. Under the Invite section, type in the names or e-mail addresses of the people you’d like to share this folder with.


Note that the people you invite will need Box accounts in order to be collaborators.

, Once you’ve listed the collaborators, set the permission level or access type for these people in the folder. Access levels can be as Co-owner, Editor, Viewer Uploader, Previewer Uploader, Viewer, Previewer, or Uploader.

, You may include a message to the recipients informing them about their roles as collaborators and other relevant notes you’d like to include.

, Once you’re done, click on the “Send” button to grant the collaborators the proper accesses. Be sure to include everyone from your Dropbox collaborators so that the transition will be smooth."

If you have any spreadsheets already open, copy the content, just in case.,
Try opening them anew from Google Drive.,

Wait.,

, If they open, problem solved. If you still see the whirring circle attempting to open them, proceed on.

, Possibly your current browser is playing up. If you can, either switch to a different browser or hop on another computer. See if you can open the spreadsheet from the new browser or computer. If you can, it is likely a browser issue on your usual computer. To fix:


Turn the browser off. Shut down all open tabs.
Wait a few seconds (always a good idea to let things settle).
Open your browser again.
Open the Google Drive.
Click on the spreadsheet you want to open. If it was a browser issue, then the spreadsheet should now open, no problems.

, If the above steps haven't worked, consider waiting a half hour or so before trying again. Possibly something is held up Google's end, possibly there is just too much traffic or something isn't right out there. Come back and try again later and hopefully it will remedy.


Stay calm by turning this wait into a coffee break and an excuse to clean up that messy stack of papers or bills.

, This might alert you to a temporary issue. (Just search for ""Google blog""––the return will point you to the blog using your country location.)

, If they are, find out what everyone has done with the spreadsheet that day to see if you can identify a fault.

, If all else fails, contact Google Technical Support with your problem. See: https://www.google.com/contact/ for more details.

If you have Windows 8.1, it’s already built-in.;
, Double-click on the setup file and let the program install.


The setup file has a blue cloud icon with the filename (File) OneDriveSetup.exe.
You may find the setup file on your desktop or in your default Downloads folder.

, Before installation begins, you will have to sign in with your OneDrive or Microsoft account information. Enter the details on the fields provided.

, Continue clicking “Next” to install using the default, recommended settings.


Once done, you will see the OneDrive icon on the notification area at the right side of your taskbar.
It will begin downloading and syncing your OneDrive files to your computer.

, Before you leave for that long trip or business meeting, ensure that your PC is turned on, and leave it on. The PC must be up and running for Fetch to work.

, Check that the PC is connected to the Internet. Fetch will pass through the Internet in order to access your files in this PC. If the PC is not connected, it cannot access the files.

, Skip to the next step if OneDrive is already running on your PC; otherwise, open the OneDrive desktop application by looking for it in your Start Menu and clicking on it.


You can check if OneDrive is running by looking at the notification tray on the lower-right side of your screen. The application has an icon with white clouds on it. If the icon is there, then OneDrive is running.
Fetch needs the OneDrive desktop application running in order to get through your PC. It also serves as the layer of authorization and security. Otherwise, anybody can just access your files on your PC.

, Right-click the OneDrive icon found on the notification tray. Select “Settings” to open the program’s settings menu. Under the General section, look for the option “Let me use OneDrive to fetch any of my files on this PC,” and tick it to enable it.


This option needs to be enabled to notify OneDrive that you’re okay with the remote fetching feature.

, Click the “OK” button to save and exit the Settings menu.

, If you’re away from home and need to access files on your PC, just head to any available PC where you are located. Open a web browser and go to OneDrive’s website.


Any PC will do, and there’s no need to install the OneDrive desktop application on this other PC.

, Find the “Sign In” button and click on it. Use your OneDrive account or Microsoft account to sign in.

, Inside your OneDrive account online, go to the left panel menu and look for the PCs section. This section lists all the PCs with the OneDrive desktop application installed and running under your OneDrive account.

, If you have multiple PCs running the OneDrive desktop application, you will see several PC names here. Select the PC where the files you want to retrieve or fetch are located.

, As part of OneDrive’s efforts to secure your PC and your files there, it has this added layer of security check. Click on the “Sign in with a security code” link to begin the authentication process.

, As part of its verification process, it will ask you for your OneDrive account e-mail. Input your e-mail address in the appropriate field, and click the blue “Next” button. OneDrive will send your security code to this e-mail.


This e-mail address needs to match the one in OneDrive.

, Go to your e-mail client, sign in, and open your inbox. Look for the e-mail with the subject title “Microsoft account security code.” Open the e-mail and copy the security code.

, Go back to OneDrive’s page where you left off after entering your e-mail address. Input the code that you received in the e-mail into the field provided. Click the blue “Submit” button to proceed. OneDrive will verify your code.

, Once OneDrive has authenticated the code, you will now have a direct remote access to your computer’s folders and files. Your computer directory will appear in the different categories as how they’re structured in your PC.


Folders will appear in blue boxes.

, A single click on the blue folders will open them up. Continue your folder navigation by clicking on the folders. You will be able to see all your PC’s folders and files.

, Once you see the file you need to download from your PC, just click on it and it will start downloading onto your current PC. Once it’s on your current PC, you can view, edit, and work on it as any local file on that PC.

, If you don’t need to work on the file right away but would still like to access in on a later time from another PC or device, you can opt to upload the file to your OneDrive. This can be done remotely and directly:


Hover over the file you’d like to upload and tick on the check box that will appear on it.
On the header action menu, select “Upload to OneDrive.” Choose the destination of the file in your OneDrive directory and click the “Upload” button.
The file will start uploading to OneDrive. A progress bar will appear for you to monitor the upload.

, If you want to check a file’s properties without actually downloading it locally or uploading it to OneDrive, hover over the file and tick on the check box that will appear on it. On the header action menu, select “Properties.” The file’s properties will be displayed on a right panel on the same page.


The file type, date created, file path, and file size will be displayed.

Google cars equipped with specialized camera equipment drive the road networks of a variety of countries, taking 360° photos to aid in navigation and exploration. Google Maps allows you to see everywhere that Street View is available.


You can also access Street View through Google Earth.;
, You can search for a location or use your mouse to navigate around the map. Searching for something will often place a pin on the map at that location.

, Once you've found the location you want to look at, you can turn on Street View. Depending on how you found the location and what version of Maps you are using, there are several different ways to start Street View.


Street View for a search result. If you've searched for an address or location and a pin has been placed on the map, you can access the Street View for that location by clicking on the photo in the information box that appears when the pin is selected.
Drag and drop the Pegman. Click and hold the Pegman icon to ""Grab"" it. The roads will highlight to show where Street View is available. Roads with Street View will have a blue line running down the middle. Buildings that you can see inside have a yellow circle. Scenic spots will have a blue circle. If you are using the new Google maps preview, clicking the Pegman will toggle the Street View layer on the map.
Use the Explore bar. If you are using the new Maps preview, you can click the arrow icon in the lower-right corner to open the Explore bar. This will display notable locations and sights near your current location on the map. Clicking these photos will take you directly to the Street View for that spot.
Zoom all the way in. Zooming in past the closest level in Maps will automatically load Street View for that location if it is available.

, While in Street View, you can look around by clicking and dragging your mouse. Looking is usually by opposite mouse directions; for example, to look left you would click, hold, and move your mouse to the right.


You can use the buttons around the compass to look around as well. This is located in the upper-left corner of the original Maps and the lower-right corner of the new Maps preview.

, The true beauty of Street View lies in your ability to completely navigate while using it. Click anywhere on the image and Street View will attempt to move you to the closest spot. Use this to explore neighborhoods, take a virtual vacation, or look for landmarks for when you visit in person.


Streets will have arrows when you look at them. Clicking these arrows will move you a small distance on that street in that direction."

Post a current news story.,
Ensure your article is not 1 of the following types of articles: informational, how-to, fictional, or advice.,
Finish your article completely before attempting to have it ranked on Google News.,
Format a unique URL that contains at least 3 numbers in it.,
Go to Google News publishers support page to suggest your news article.,
Click the first link, ""Suggest news content."",
Fill out the form at the bottom of the page.,
Look out for updates or questions in your email inbox that will suggest your news story has been accepted.",How to Appear on Google News," Many people use a public relations press release format in order to ensure their article appears as a news story. The story must be primarily made of text rendered in HTML coding. HTML coding is a very common way of coding websites. Portable Document Format (PDF) is not HTML format and will not be listed on Google News. Check with the person posting the story on your site, if you are unsure if your site uses HTML coding.


If it is only a video or a picture, it may appear under the ""Images"" or ""Videos"" Google search tabs, but it will not appear on Google News.;
, Also make sure it is not a classified ads, job postings or an event announcement.

, Currently, each suggested Google News site is only checked, or ""crawled,"" once. If there are changes made to the story or site, it will not show up on the Google News link.


Web crawling pertains to a software program that automatically downloads websites if they fit certain criteria. This is what Google News uses to choose its news programs in order to review the large amount of story suggestions it receives every day.

,


Each story that you suggest for Google News must have a unique, permanent URL. Many sites post links or news entries on a single page day after day. To appear on Google News, the URL must be a unique page that will not be replaced by any other articles.
For example: www.bestsites.com/news.html would not be accepted because it is likely the place where all news appears. However, www.bestsites.com/news123.html would fit Google criteria because it is unique sub-page to your site.
Each URL must contain at least 3 numbers. These numbers must be unique to the news story and they cannot be a 4 digit number that starts with 19 or 20 because it resembles a year.

, Find the ""Email Us"" icon shaped like a yellow envelope.

, It will ask you if you are a representative of the news provider for the content. Check the ""Yes"" circle. It will also ask if your news story is listed on a site, a mobile site or a YouTube channel. Identify the kind of site you are using in the following boxes.

, You should list your URL, the authors, the location, language, categories and your contact information, as well as anything else that is applicable to your news story. Press ""Submit"" when you are finished. This will allow the Google News engine to crawl your site for the requirements and data.

,


Once accepted to Google News, your article can take 1 to 2 weeks to appear on Google News searches.

If you already have an google ID and password that you use with Google services such as gmail, youtube or other, then you can use that as the login information for AdWords.
If you don't have an email address that can be used with Google services then you should select the option that says ""I do not use these other services."" You can then create a new Google account and verify the email address by logging in through Gmail and clicking on the verify link.
If you are creating a work advertisement, but Google suggests you use your personal ID, you may want to back out and use a business ID. Once your email is used to create an adwords account, it can't be used for any other adwords account.

, This will take you to the Your First Campaign page to set up your advertising.


Enter your website address. You may choose to enter your home page (example, www.example.com), or another part of your website (example: www.example.com/buynow). Where you send the visitors is up to you, and depends on what you are trying to accomplish.
Enter your target audience. There are three parts to a target audience:

Location. Google will default usually to your country. If you are selling a local service, you would simply remove the country and add the name of your city. Or if you sell internationally, you can choose other countries.
Network. Google defaults you to running ads on all websites in the Google network, including the tens of thousands of websites where you see ""Ads By Google."" If you only want to show on Google and its limited 'search partners,' uncheck the box that says ""Display Network.""
Keywords. This is the most challenging part of advertising on Google for new advertisers. A keyword is simply a word or set of words that you think people will be typing into Google to find your product or service. For example, if you are selling shoes, you might pick keywords like, ""red shoes,"" ""Nike shoes,"" and ""buy new shoes.""



, If you want to spend $50 a day, simply enter $50.


You want to enter a number large enough that, you will get a good sense if your ads are working, but not so much that you get burned financially.
The conservative thing to do is to, set your budget assuming you will waste every penny. You probably won't, but this is the safe way to start out.
Realize you won't know the actual price you will pay per click until you start. The prices are set in a complicated auction process where what you actually pay will be all over the map. As an example, if you are advertising on keywords for popular songs in India, you may pay only one cent per click. If you are advertising for insurance or trying to market a weight loss scam, you could be paying $10 per click or more.

, The default is ""Automatically set my bids to get the most clicks within my budget."" You can change the setting to ""I'll set my bids manually.""


Automatically setting the price you pay per click sounds alarming, but it usually works fine. Google tries to give you the maximum value for your money.
If you want to manually choose the price you pay per click (CPC), you will need to enter a number for each keyword.

, Here is where you write your actual ad that people on Google will see.


Write something catchy that makes your readers want to click on the ad. The ad should be catchy, yet truthful.
Google will not approve your ad if it violates certain policies. As examples, the ad cannot promise something that is not true (don't say Free iPad giveaway if you don't have one.) Similarly they forbid too many capital letters, overactive punctuation and the like.
In the add, tell people about your business.
Add a call-to-action such as ""Call Us"" or ""Buy Tickets.""
Use relevant keywords within the ad text. These are the words that you want people to type on the Google search engine when you want your ad to appear.
Hit ""Save and Continue"" when you are done.

,


Select your desired payment method, usually a credit card, and provide the pertinent billing information.
Hit ""Save and Continue"" when you are done.

, Here you can review everything before you spend any money.


Examine the ads, keywords, locations of your ads etc, and confirm they are correct. Hit save.
Accept the terms and conditions for using AdWords.

,


If you are in an industry or a country with a lot of fraud or bad actors, review may take a few days. Google is wary of ads that hint of weight loss, lawsuits, pharmaceutical sales, sex, firearms and others. Other advertising networks like Bing and Facebook allow some things that Google does not. Even if you are legitimate, anything close to those topics will come in for extra scrutiny.

, How will you decide your ads are working?


You can choose increase in sales, increase in inquires, downloads of sales material, registrations, or simply website visits.

, If your success is selling a pair of shoes, you want to find in Google (or elsewhere) a count of how many sales you made from your ads.


If you are only looking to increase visits to your site, you can see that in Google.
If you want to measure sales, downloads or similar, you may need to have an IT person set up what is called ""conversion tracking.""Conversion tracking is not hard for someone to set up, but may take a while to find someone to do it.

, You want to pull out a number that web people call Cost Per Action, or CPA. That simply means how much you pay Google for each of your successes.


For example, if you are selling shoes, and you spend $20 to Google for every shoe sale, you have a CPA of $20. That may be good or may be bad; but you will have a firm number.

, You may want to increase your advertising if you are happy, or rethink your ads, keywords or budget if you are unhappy.

During a chat, you'll need to stay logged into your account to send and receive messages. If you want to do something else while you're chatting, a good idea is to open a new tab in your web browser and leave Gmail running in the first tab.;
, In the bottom left corner of the inbox, you should see a short list of your most frequently-talked-to Gmail contacts. The icon next to each person's name represents their status. Specifically:


A green dot means the person is online.
A yellow dot that looks like a clock means the person is online, but idle (in other words, they may not be at their computer).
A red dot with a line through it means the person is online but too busy to chat.
A grey dot that is crossed out means the person is either offline or doesn't want to be bothered.

, This will open a chat window if the person is online. Look for the small box that pops up in the bottom right.If the person is not online and you click his or her name, Gmail will automatically open a blank email to that person.

, In the chat box, click the blue square at the bottom and start typing whatever you want to say. When you're finished with your message, click enter to send it. Now, just wait for your contact to respond — you should receive a notification when they see your message and start typing.You can add emoticons (small smiley faces) to your message by clicking the smiley face icon in the bottom right of the text box and selecting the emoticon you want from the list that pops up. You can also make emoticons by typing them in manually. Click here for a list., When the person you're chatting with finishes her message and presses enter, it will display in the chat box underneath yours. Type your response the same way as before and hit enter to send it. Congratulations — you've just mastered the basics of Gmail chatting!

, Text-chatting on Gmail is fun, but if you don't want to be bothered, sometimes it's not best to get messages from friends. To change your status so that your contacts can see that you can't talk right now, click the small downward arrow next to the silhouette icon at the top of the contacts box. Then, select the status you want from the options. Your choices are:



Available: People can chat with you as normal.

Busy: People will see the red ""busy"" icon next to your name. Others can still message you, but they'll see a message that says ""(your name) is busy. You may be interrupting.""

Sign out: Logs you out. Other people will see you as offline.

Invisible: Keeps you logged-in, but other people will see you as offline.

, Don't see anyone in the contacts box that you want to chat with? You can invite people to chat with you at any time by following these steps:Type your friend's Google username in the text area at the top of the contacts box. If they're already in your contacts, you'll see their information automatically pop up. Click ""send chat"" to start chatting (it will say ""send offline chat"" if the person is offline). You can also click ""Show in chat list"" to add the person's name to the list below.
If a person isn't in your contacts, type his or her complete username and click ""invite to chat."" The person will receive an invitation the next time they log into Gmail.
Alternatively, you can also invite new contacts to chat by clicking the downward arrow at the top of the chat box you use to change your status. Select ""Add contact"" from the options and follow the instructions in the pop-up window to invite new people.

Click the movie camera icon at the top of the contacts box.,
Use the options in the pop-up window to invite people to your chat.,
Click ""Invite"" to finalize your invitations.,
Click ""Join"" when you're ready to chat.,
Alternatively, click the movie camera button in a text chat box.",How to Chat in Gmail2," This will launch a video chat in a new window. Don't worry — you won't be talking to anyone yet and no one will be able to see you until you're ready. If your computer asks you for permission to use your camera, click ""Yes"" or ""OK.""


You'll need a computer with a camera installed in the monitor (or a separate webcam peripheral) to have a video chat. Most laptops sold today come with a webcam pre-installed in the monitor.

, In the new window, you'll see a white box with several options for getting people to video chat with you. You may also see live footage of yourself behind this. Don't worry — no one can see you until you're ready. To invite people to your video chat, use the following options:


Copy the link in the ""Share the permanent link"" box (Ctrl+C on Windows, Command+C on Macs). Send this link to the people you want to video chat with any way you want (Ctrl+V to paste on Windows, Command+V on Macs). For instance, you can send them an email with the link, send it in a Skype conversation, or even use Gmail text chat to send it. When they click on the link, they'll join the call.
Alternatively, type in the names or email addresses of people you want to join the call in the lower box. If they're in your contacts, Gmail will automatically display them. If not, you can still send a video chat invite by typing their entire name or email address and clicking the name when you're done.

, When you've prepared all your invitations, click this button to send them. You don't need to do this if you shared the permanent link, which lets people join automatically. When you send your invitations, you can also use the check boxes in the menu to do the following:


Require your guests to be over 18 before joining the call.
Offer a ""silent invitation"" — this will make the recipient's computer not make an audible ring with the notification.

, As people receive your invitations, they will join your video call. When you're ready to join yourself, click the green ""join"" button at the bottom of the window.


You should be able to speak with your friends and see their faces in the bottom right corner. Click on a person's face to switch the larger video feed to that person.

, Another way to start a video chat in Gmail is via the normal text chat. First, start a text chat with one of your contacts (see section above) and then click the video camera button in the top left of the chat box. This will call the person immediately, so be ready to chat right away.

, Before you can use the Gmail phone feature, you'll need to install this plugin, which should only take a few moments. The plugin is completely free. Use the following steps to install it:


Click the ""download the voice plugin"" link in the phone box.
On the next page, click the blue ""try it now"" button. You'll be taken back to your inbox.
When the ""allow Google to run Google talk?"" message appears in your browser, click ""Allow."" If you don't see it, look for a thin bar that pops down from the top of the screen. The plugin will install automatically.

, Now, the message about downloading the plugin should have disappeared from the phone box. Click the buttons or use the numbers on your keyboard to type in the phone number you want to call. You can also search for people in your contacts by typing their name in instead.


Domestic calls in the U.S. are free. International calls cost money based on their length. However, this can be as low as one cent per minute depending on the country. Click here for information on Google Voice's calling rates., This will dial the number you have given. If the person on the other end picks up, you'll be connected within a few moments and you can start talking just like on a phone.


If you are making an international call, the price of your call will display in the top right corner of the phone box.

, Just like with video chat, you can also call someone that you're currently text chatting with just a few clicks. To do this, first click the phone icon at the top of the text box (it's right next to the movie camera icon). This will create a link in the chat box that says ""Invite (your friend's username) to voice/video chat. Click here."" Click the link to send the invitation to voice chat!


Note that your recipient will need to choose to accept the call before it can begin.

If you choose your existing domain, a field will appear on the form asking for the domain name.

The recommended way (the default):

Using the service that sold you your domain name takes just a couple minutes. It defaults to GoDaddy, but the list is extensive. Select yours, and proceed through the verification process.


The alternate methods:

Add a meta tag to your site's home page. If you have access to the site html, you can opt this method. But, this is less recommended as most of the websites make use of software such as Wordpress and wikis and not direct html.
Create an HTML file and upload it to your website. An HTML file should be placed on the website via FTP or via cPanel administered by the chosen domain. Type the address into the web browser and if it opens the page and displays the text, it means that the verification of ownership is about to succeed. Now click on the link “I've completed the steps above” to start the verification. The process itself can take up to 48 hours (in rare cases, but it's automatic most of the time) and it will appear on the control panel (Dashboard). If it does not change after that time, this means that the verification process has failed.
Link your Google Analytics account with the Apps account. If you already have a Google Analytics account, this is an easy one click solution, and is less time consuming when compared to other available options.

Place each business location on one row, filling out the information under the appropriate headers. Google provides detailed guidelines on its website, but here are the most important tips:Under Store Code, give each of your business locations a unique identifier. For example, if all of your businesses are coffee shops that share the same name, designate each Store Code as JoeCoffee1, JoeCoffee2, and so on. Avoid special characters and leading or trailing spaces.
Some fields have a 60 character maximum, while others have an 80 character maximum.
If your postal code begins with 0, make sure your spreadsheet formatting does not delete that digit.
You may use the full name of your country, or look up its ISO 3166-1 two-letter country code.

, Use the search field on the upper right corner and enter the address of the building you want to view. Tap the “Search” button on your keypad to proceed.


Just like in Google Maps, Google Earth will bring you to the location you’ve entered. At first, the area view may be too far up to be able to focus on the building.

, Before you can view the building, you have to focus to it first. Your fingers act as your navigation tools.


To move around, use a finger and touch any point on the map, then drag it until you’ve reached the view that you want.
To rotate, use two fingers and touch two points on the map, then rotate your fingers until you’ve reached the perspective that you want.
To zoom, use two fingers and touch two points on the map. Move them away from each other to zoom out and move them away towards each other to zoom in.

, Wait a few moments for the screen to focus. Once it’s done, you can see the building very clearly, as if you’re hovering over and around it.


The quality of the pictures will depend on the size and capacity of your mobile device though, so results will vary.

, Click the drop-down list for the options for the different units of measure. You can choose from Centimeters, Meters, Kilometers, Inches, Feet, Yards, Miles, Nautical Miles, and Smoots. Select Feet from the list, or any other unit of measurement for which you can find the conversion to acreage.

, Enclose the area you want to measure by plotting points on the ground. You can plot as many as you need to make it as accurate as possible. Each point you add will be connected to the previous point by a yellow line. Connect the final point to the first point to close the area.

, The total area will be displayed in the Ruler window. There are 43,560 sq feet in an acre or 4,047 sq meters. Divide the area shown by the appropriate conversion factor to determine the acreage of the land.

First things first.,
Find your home.",How to Find Your House on Google Earth1," Before you can see your house from overhead, you'll need to make sure you have Google Earth downloaded and installed. You can find it in Google Products at https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/products/index.html, under the Geo section:


Follow the installation instructions, and when done, locate Google Earth and launch it.;
, With Google Earth running, it's time for the fun stuff. Hang on!

"
"
Enter your address.,
Zoom in closer.,
Move your cursor to the right side of the page.,
Look around.",How to Find Your House on Google Earth2," In the top left corner, toggle open Search if it's not already open. When it is, you will see three buttons: Fly To, Find Business, and Directions. Click on Fly To.


Enter in your street address, and click the magnifying glass. Google Earth will rotate (more, or less depending on the state or country you've entered), and zoom in pretty quickly to your neighborhood as seen from a few thousand feet. There will be a gray crosshair over your house, next to your address.

, This is nice, but still a long way from what you want to see. Double click just outside of the gray crosshairs, and let's get closer.


Each double click brings you about halfway between where you were, and the ground.
Continue clicking until you are very close. That's usually about three double-clicks.
As you can see, it's a little blurry now. That's because the cameras that shoot the tops of houses are several miles up. They do a remarkable job despite that, but you were probably hoping for more.

, A set of controls will appear—–two virtual joysticks, one with a hand and one with an eye, and if Google has mapped your neighborhood, an orange human icon. Drag the icon to your house and release it. You will be placed on the ground, on your street!

, You can pan around, looking at your neighborhood—–you can even click on the street and ""walk"" along the road, anywhere Google has mapped!

"

Check out the controls.,
Find your country.,
Go to Paris, France for a trial.,
Take a hike.",How to Find Your House on Google Earth3," In the upper left of the Google Earth window, you'll see a set of controls. Use this guide:

, If North America is not your home continent, rotate the earth by using the Rotate Joystick tool.


Click the left arrow to rotate towards Asia, the right arrow to rotate towards Europe, the up arrow to head to the North Pole, and the down arrow should you live in Antarctica.
Alternately, you can just click and drag Earth in the direction you wish to go.

, Rotate the Earth to the east (assuming a North American starting point). Using the joystick arrow as described, rotate the Earth to the east until France comes into view. If it's not in the center of the screen, use the joystick arrows to move it up or down towards the center. Use the outer ring of the Pan Joystick tool to rotate France into the proper position.

Place everything so that the cables don’t have to stretch to reach the computer, and place the computer itself near a power outlet or power strip.


As you plug devices in, mind the cables to keep them from getting bunched and tangled.
Make sure that the computer tower is in a well-ventilated spot. Heat is the number one enemy of computer components, so the more you can mitigate it the better.;
, Modern mice and keyboards connect via USB, and can be plugged into any available USB port on the front or back of the computer. Some keyboards have USB ports as well that you can plug your mouse into.


Older mice and keyboards connected with special plugs. These plugs are color coded; the keyboard plugs into the purple socket, and the mouse plugs into the green socket on the back of the computer.
Many older computers require a keyboard to be connected in order to boot up.

, You may have several options when it comes to connecting your monitor to your computer. If you have a dedicated video card installed, you’ll want to connect your monitor to one of its ports. If not, you can connect your monitor to one of the ports on the motherboard. Monitor cables only fit one direction, so don’t try to force them.


Dedicated video card ports are usually horizontal on a tower computer, while motherboard ports are vertical.
Use the highest quality connection possible. The major available connectors will be VGA, DVI, and HDMI. HDMI and DVI will result in the best image quality.
DVI and VGA cables should be secured with the small screws on each side. This will prevent them from accidentally coming unplugged. HDMI cables are inserted like a USB cable.

, If you are connecting to your home network via Ethernet, plug it in to your motherboard. If you are connecting wirelessly, you may need to attach an antenna to a special plug on the back of the motherboard or wireless card.

, If you are connecting speakers to your computer, plug them into the color-coded ports on the back. If you have a dedicated sound card, be sure to plug the speakers into the card for the best-quality sound.


If your monitor has speakers, you can connect the monitor to the computer using a sound cable. If your monitor is connected via HDMI, the sound will be transferred through the HDMI cable as well.

, The power supply needs to be connected to an outlet in order for the computer to function. Use the cable that came with your computer or power supply, and plug it into a three-pronged outlet.


To protect your computer against power surges or power outages, consider plugging into a surge protector or battery backup unit.

, If you can, use zip ties to bundle your cables together. Having well-organized cables will reduce the amount of dust that gets captured, and makes it easier to keep clean. Make sure that you don’t have anything bundled too tight, and that everything can still move around as need (especially the mouse).

, Before connecting any printers, cameras, flash drives, or other USB devices, turn your computer on first and let it load into the computer's operating system. (Windows, Mac OS X, Ubuntu...) Once you are logged in, you can plug these devices in. Your operating system will then automatically install any software needed to use them.

Clean up after yourself.",How to Destroy an Old Computer1," Although you’ll take precautions to limit the amount of materials that escape and fly around, you’ll want to protect yourself. Wear goggles, a facemask, and sturdy gloves. Wear long sleeves and pants to avoid leaving any skin exposed to potentially hazardous materials.
, On a surface you don’t mind denting (a garage floor, a carport, etc.), lay out an old towel or blanket. You may wind up having to throw this item away, so make sure it is not a new or favorite item.The thicker the fabric is, the better. Ideally, the fabric will be able to remain intact when faced with glass, jagged metal, and other broken parts.
A solid wool or cotton throw will work well, while you should stay away from linen.

, One your stage has been set, grab a sledgehammer. A sledgehammer will be easy enough to wield and heavy enough to damage all of the complex components that make up your computer.Sledgehammers come in various sizes and weights. If you are nervous about holding a 10-pound (160 oz) hammer, you can likely find a 3-5 pound (48-80 oz) one at your local hardware store.

, Place your computer in the middle of the towel or blanket, keeping it as far away from the edges as possible. This will help keep all of the broken components contained once you’ve gotten started., Place a second blanket or towel on top of your computer, lining the edges up with the bottom fabric as much as possible. This fabric, too, should be something you have no desire to save, because it may need to be thrown away.

If you have one thin blanket and one thick, place the thicker one on top. A thin blanket or towel may unravel if it is hit directly with a sledgehammer.

, Now the fun part! Begin hitting the computer through the blanket with your sledgehammer, covering every possible inch. Keeping your arms, legs, and face protected, continue hammering until your computer is audibly and visibly destroyed., Once your computer has been destroyed, make sure you properly dispose of all of the pieces. Batteries, for instance, should never be thrown in your dumpster, but should be disposed of according to your city’s codes. Electrical parts are similarly tricky, and should be handled with care.Most municipal sites have information regarding disposal practices. You can also contact your city or county’s waste management department for disposal instructions.

Dispose of the hard drive appropriately.",How to Destroy an Old Computer2," Remove all of your personal information by reformatting your hard drive, transferring your files to an external hard drive or USB drive and then deleting them, or having your hard drive overwritten.Transferring and deleting your files is the easiest way to wipe your hard drive, and requires no outside help. It is not the most secure method of removal.
Reformatting your hard drive can be done by going into your computer’s settings and selecting a “wipe” or “format” option for your hard drive.
Overwriting your hard drive is typically done by a computer professional for a fee. If your computer has a lot of personal or financial information, this may be the safest option.

, Once you’ve finished removing your information to the best of your ability, remove the bottom panel of your computer to expose the computer’s inner workings. Take your hard drive out, including the metal case typically surrounding the disc and circuit boards.Most computers are held together with small screws. Remove these screws, and separate the bottom panel from your computer.
To locate your hard drive, look for what appears to be a small, circular disk, much like a CD.

, Although the drive has been wiped, you want to be sure nothing remains and is able to be accessed. Using a drill bit of any size, drill a hole through the hard drive in at least one area. For added security, you can drill multiple holes in your hard drive, depending on how large the drive itself is., Place all of the components of your hard drive into a box and dispose of them according to your city codes. If you are not sure what your city codes are, you can contact a local electronics store and ask how to properly dispose of everything. "

Wipe your hard drive.,
Remove your computer battery.,
Remove all of the keyboard keys.,
Unscrew the bottom of the computer from the rest of the body.,
Dismantle the circuit boards.,
Remove your hard drive.,
Set aside working parts for recycling/reuse.",How to Destroy an Old Computer3," This is particularly important when you are selling or donating computers or computer parts. Wipe your hard drive yourself or take it to a professional, as you do not want a stranger to stumble across your private, personal information.Most computer repair stores also have the ability to wipe hard drives.
You can also contact your computer’s manufacturer for more information on how to wipe your hard drive effectively, or a technician who can do it for you.

, If you are hoping to recycle your whole computer rather than individual pieces, you can stop at this step and move on to donating your intact computer. Most recycling programs must recycle or dispose of batteries separately, so removing and disposing of your computer’s battery is both responsible and convenient for the company you are donating to., Keyboard keys can be used to replace broken keyboards, or they can be reused to create crafts. Whichever your preference is, removing them from the board will give you the option of selling, donating, or repurposing the keys., To properly take your computer apart, you will need to remove the bottom piece from your computer, as this is where all of the computer’s innards are stored. Screwing the bottom from the rest of the computer will give you access to everything, including the hard drive., Computers are filled with circuit boards. Some have a single, large board, while others will have numerous small boards. If your computer is in good working condition, these boards can be set aside and sold or donated to fix broken computers., Although you’ve already gone through the step of wiping your hard drive, you can further ensure your information’s security by removing the drive altogether. You can remove the hard drive and keep it for your personal records or you can destroy it., All working parts can be gathered together and set aside to be recycled. You could also reuse them yourself, or gift them to someone who works with computers.Check your local recycling center for needs and requirements.
If you do decide to go the reuse route, you may be able to make a bit of money selling spare parts.

Understand the requirements and how it works.,

Ensure your Raspberry Pi boots to the desktop.,

Click on the System tab.,

Open the main autostart file in a text editor.,

Using the arrow keys, navigate to the end of the second line and press ↵ Enter.,

Add a command to launch your script.,

Include the full paths to every filename.,

When you have entered the proper commands to launch your script, press Ctrl+X.,
Test it out!,
Edit the autostart file of an individual user.,

Repeat the previous editing steps.,
Test it out.",How to Execute a Script at Startup on the Raspberry Pi," This method requires the PIXEL desktop environment with the latest version of the Raspbian Jessie operating system. It is achieved by editing an ""autostart"" file that runs commands at startup in the LXDE desktop environment, which is the framework the Raspberry Pi's PIXEL desktop is built on. This method is preferred in scenarios where:

your script requires the desktop environment to run
your script needs to run from a terminal window
you want to specify which users the script will autostart for;
, Click on the raspberry icon in the upper left side of the task bar. Then go to Preferences and click Raspberry Pi Configuration., In the ""Boot"" section, make sure the option ""To Desktop"" is selected. Then click OK. Great, let's get started!, In a new terminal window type the following command:

sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

then press ↵ Enter. This will open the main autostart file in the nano editor. Commands added to this file will launch at startup regardless of who is logged in. Don't worry if your autostart file contains a few extra lines that are different than the ones pictured., This will created a new line above the @xscreensaver -no-splash entry. Many users have reported that commands added below this line do not run successfully so it's common practice to add your custom commands above the @xscreensaver entry., This is where you have the most options as you can enter any terminal command you would normally use to launch your script. For example, to run a bash script called ""myscript.sh"" which is located in the home directory of the user ""pi"" one would enter the command:

/home/pi/myscript.sh

Likewise, if superuser permissions are required to run the script you can even preface the command with sudo., For example, to run a Python script that requires superuser permissions called ""myscript.py"" which is located in the home directory of the user ""pi"", you would enter the full path to both the Python script itself and the Python interpreter, such as:

sudo /usr/bin/python /home/pi/myscript.py

Lastly, if you wish to run your script in a new terminal window on startup, you can use the @lxterminal command with the -e modifier followed by the full path of your script in quotes. For example:

@lxterminal -e ""/home/pi/myscript.sh""

This will execute the script from a new terminal window.
, You will be asked if you would like to save your changes, type Y and press ↵ Enter.

If you don't want your script to run on startup any longer, simply edit the autostart file once again, only this time delete the lines you added previously. Once you save and exit, your script will no longer run automatically on startup.

, In the terminal type:

sudo reboot

and press ↵ Enter. Your Raspberry Pi will restart and your script will run when the desktop boots up. Nice work!, If you have multiple user accounts on your Raspberry Pi and want a script to autostart for only a specific user, you must instead edit the autostart file associated with that specific user. For example, for the default user ""pi"" the autostart file is located at:

/home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

Therefore, to edit this file, in a terminal window you would type:

sudo nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

and press ↵ Enter., Just like before, input the desired command to launch your script in the correct place in the autostart file. When you are satisfied, be sure to save your changes before you exit., In the terminal type:

sudo reboot

and press ↵ Enter. When the computer restarts, log into the user corresponding to the autostart file you recently changed. Your script will run as soon as the desktop boots up!"

Turn the computer off, including all power strips.,
Make a diagram of the cabling between parts, and draw out the ports on each.,
Label your cables.,
Unplug all the cables.,
Tape the cables to their peripherals.,
Move everything over.,
Reverse the disassembly.,
Plug in the power cables.","How to Disassemble, Transport, and Reassemble a PC"," Shut your computer down first from software (Start Menu->Shut Down, or issue ""halt"" from a root terminal in Linux), turn off the power strip, and unplug it from the wall. If you have an uninterruptible power supply, disconnect that too. When you're done, there should be no connect between your hardware and any power source. Most towers have a small light somewhere that will go off when you have disconnected its power cable. This is an important step because some ports can be damaged by unplugging them while power remains.;
, The point here is not photorealism but rather to know later that there's a cable from the second port over on the monitor to the second port down on the tower. So trace each of your cables, figure out what it plugs into, and where.

, I like to wrap masking tape around the cable so that a big long strip hangs off, and then double that over to make a tag. Label where each end of the cable goes. Some cables cannot be reversed (for example, your camera's USB cable probably has a big end for the computer and a smaller end for the camera).

, If possible, unplug them at both ends; if a cable is wrenched in a detachable port during shipping, the port might be ruined. Either loop them in figure-eights secured with a zip or twist tie in the middle, or in a circle as if around an invisible spool, secured by wrapping one end in a spiral around the curve of the loop.

, If you look at your cabling diagram, you'll notice that just about everything has a three-pronged power cable into the wall or power strip, and an odder-looking data cable into the tower. So the tower is at the center and everything else is at the periphery, hence the name peripherals to refer collectively to monitor, keyboard, etc. Taping each cable to its peripheral prevents them from getting lost or mixed up. Power cables in particular can look alike.

, If you can get it all driven to the destination, make sure everything is secured. At the very least, wedge the tower in the passenger-side footwell rather than letting it rattle around in the trunk, and put the monitor in a box so nothing stabs into the screen. If you need to ship it, consult your shipper of choice about appropriate packing protocol. Your own homebrew methods may be either subpar, or unacceptable for insurance purposes (and if you ship a computer, you need insurance).

, The very cautious will want to plug cables in at the less expensive end first. Once in a blue moon, even when neither end is connected to a power source, a spark will jump, and when that happens it could burn stuff out. Besides which, the less expensive end is almost always the peripheral, so this also means only one trip under the desk.

, Always leave power to last. Note that only your monitor and tower should plug into the UPS---additional peripherals will reduce its discharge time dramatically.

Backups are always good so backup your important data!,
Backup your registry!,
Restart your computer and enter the BIOS.,
Boot into Linux by using your own installation or a bootable Linux CD.,
Open a Linux terminal and type the following command: lspci -vvnn | less.,
Find the reference to your AMD SB850 SATA RAID Controller (look for an entry with these word on it) and note the following information: Vendor ID: a 4 digit number, Device ID: a 4 digit number, Subsystem ID: and 8 digit number split by a semicolon ("":"")

,Reboot again, go back into the BIOS configuration and revert the SATA mode to IDE

,Boot into windows (choosing ""boot normally"" if requested)

,Extract the ZIP file with the AMD RAID drivers you downloaded (as pointed out in the previous section) and navigate to the folder with the drivers for your version of Windows

,
Open the *.INF file in there, in my case ahcix64s.inf, with any text editor, like Windows Notepad (or Notepad++ if you'd like something better) and search for the section named (for the 32 bits version).,
Copy the *.SYS file you find in the same folder, mine was ahcix64s.sys, from there to the c:\windows\system32\drivers folder

,Copy the registry text below into a new file in your text editor and name it someFileName.reg:,
Save the file with your modifications!

,
Double-click the someFileName.reg and accept it being merged into your registry.,Restart your computer, enter the BIOS and change the setting to RAID or AHCI

,
Watch Windows loading using your brand new RAID-ready system!,
Recheck all previous steps, specially the tricky registry file editing part.

",How to Enable RAID or AHCI without Reinstalling Windows (for AMD SB85 or SB8XX Controllers),";
, We will be messing with it a little bit and you may want to do it. Probably simply using Windows System Restore to create a new restore point before beginning should do it. And that means now! Do it!

, Find the ""storage configuration"" section and change the SATA mode to your final choice of AHCI or RAID (it should offer three options: IDE, AHCI and RAID).

, If you happened to boot into Windows at this point by mistake, you'll probably get a BSOD and an automatic reboot. Don't despair! It's no big deal. Just move along and choose normal windows boot the next time you'll be loading it...

, It will list all PCI devices you have installed which you'll be able to browse using the PageUp and PageDown keys. If it does not work as expected, try doing the same as root using the following command: sudo lspci -vvnn | less (you'll need to provide the root password).

,,,,, Here you may see if the drivers you downloaded match your RAID controller by checking if there's one line in this section has your combination of VENdor and DEVice IDs. Leave this file opened so you can refer to this line. If there is an entry for your IDs, you're good-to-go. Else, you should re-check if your RAID controller is really a SB8xx and if you downloaded the correct drivers.

,,,, You don't have to worry about that, after all you did the registry back-up, right?

,, But... If you got again one more BSOD and a reboot, don't fret! Enter BIOS, revert to IDE, boot normally into Windows.

Inkjet printers are usually less expensive and produce good photo-quality prints. However, they typically have slower print speeds and are deceivingly expensive when printing in large quantity. The photo paper is sold in sheets and the ink cartridges are sold separately by color.


Laser printers have excellent print speeds but even color laser printers don't normally produce photo-quality images nor do they print on photo paper. For color laser printers, the toner cartridges are also sold separately by color.


Dye-sublimation printers provide excellent photo-quality prints, fast printing speeds, and vary greatly in price. The photo paper for dye-sublimation printers is sold with the exact amount of dye film needed to print the same amount of paper. For the more expensive high volume models, the paper and dye are sold together in rolls and the printer automatically cuts each photo off after printing. For the less expensive lower quantity models, the photo paper and dye are sold together in sheets.

, What type of event will your photo booth be used in and how many photos are you likely to print? What photo size do you want the prints to be and how costly is the required media? Are you going to use the photo booth in the future? Depending on your circumstance, it may be in your best interest to rent a professional event printer or buy a used model at a fraction of the cost., Whatever printer you plan to use, it must be supported by Gutenprint. Gutenprint is an open source collection of free printer drivers for use with UNIX based printing systems, which is what the Raspberry Pi uses to print. Here is a list of printers which are currently compatible with Gutenprint. If it says “EXPERIMENTAL” next to your printer, it could have issues and may not work reliably on the Raspberry Pi., CUPS (or Common Unix Printing System) is the program we need to be able to print from the Raspberry Pi. Open a new terminal window and type:




sudo apt-get install cups




then press ↵ Enter and it will load the installation files. When prompted to proceed, type Y and press ↵ Enter. CUPS will begin the installation process which could take 15 minutes or longer., In the terminal type:

then press ↵ Enter. This will open the CUPS setup page in your browser., Then click on Add Printer. You will be prompted for your username and password.

The default username is pi and the default password is raspberry unless it was previously changed.

, Ignore the VNC Remote Printer and don't worry if your printer is listed twice., In the example pictured, we will rename the printer from the default Sony_UP-DR200 to simply SonyUP so it's easier to remember and type. You can also enter a location tag if you wish. In this example we will enter photobooth as the location. Then click Continue., Then click Add Printer., If you don't know what a particular setting does, it's best to leave it alone. The most important setting is to ensure that the Media Size corresponds with the paper size you are currently using. Then click Set Default Options. You should see a confirmation page which displays ""Printer 'YourPrinterName' default options have been set successfully."" This will then redirect you to the printer's main status and job page., Open up a new terminal window and type:

lpstat -p

and then press ↵ Enter. This will return the name and status of the current default printer. The displayed printer name should be the one you designated earlier in the CUPS setup and the status should be ""idle"" if the printer is not in use., In the terminal type:

ls

then press ↵ Enter. This will return a list of directories and files that are in the home directory. In the list you should find the filename of the picture you took earlier in the Connect the Camera Module section., In the terminal type:

lp -d PRINTERNAME cam.jpg

only instead of PRINTERNAME type in your own printer's name and substitute cam.jpg with the filename of your picture, then press ↵ Enter. Your picture will print from the printer! Great work!, Creating a photo booth program from scratch is beyond the scope of this guide. Luckily, there are many different programs floating around on the net that different users have written for their own DIY photo booth projects! Luckier still, many of those awesome people have made their open source code free to the public for personal use.

You can search places like Github.com for one that suits your needs, however this guide will use a program written by Kenneth Centurion, adorably named 'boothy,' as an example. It's simple and fairly easy to understand and could be customized without too much programming knowledge. You can inspect the files and explore the code in your browser here: https://github.com/zoroloco/boothy., Cloning is simply another way of saying 'downloading' and a repository is simply a collection of files. Open a new terminal window and change the directory by entering:

cd /usr/local/src

then hit ↵ Enter. Next, clone the boothy repository to this folder by typing:

sudo git clone git://github.com/zoroloco/boothy.git

then press ↵ Enter. This will copy the entire boothy depository and all it's files to the directory you are currently in. Great work!, You will need to make many of these new files writable and executable so that you can edit and run the various files. You can learn more about the different permissions settings on the official Linux website. The quickest way is to make the entire boothy directory readable, writable, and executable to everyone. To do this, in the terminal window type:

sudo chmod 777 -R /usr/local/src/boothy

and press ↵ Enter., The INSTALL.txt file has a list of commands that will download and install various packages that you will need to run boothy. Instead of enter them all manually, you can run the text file as a script. In the terminal type:

sudo bash /usr/local/src/boothy/INSTALL.txt

and press ↵ Enter. Be sure to respond to any prompts during the installation process. This step could take quite a while, so this would be a great time to grab a cup of coffee! Wait until all the packages are installed before continuing to the next step., In the terminal type:

sudo nano /usr/local/src/boothy/run.sh

and press ↵ Enter. This will open the file run.sh in a text editor within the terminal. Use the arrow keys to navigate and add a -i on the bottom line after the word ""python"" so the whole code appears as:




#!/bin/bash
#
# chmod +x run.sh
#
#
clear
sudo python -i /usr/local/src/boothy/pbooth.py




Then press Ctrl+X and it will ask you if you want to save. Press y and press ↵ Enter.,, GPIO stands for General Purpose Input Output and it refers to the 40 pins on the Raspberry Pi. They are used to hook up different electronic input output objects like buttons, switches, lights, etc. and can then be programmed to do just about anything. If you inspected the pbooth.py file earlier you might have noticed that the code designates the BUTTON pin as 26. Since they aren't labeled on the Raspberry Pi, refer to a schematic of the designated numbers., Use another colored jumper wire and hook it up to a ground pin. There is actually a ground pin right next to pin 26 on the last pin in the same row. As shown in the image, a red jumper wire is hooked to pin 26 and a black jumper wire is hooked to ground., Breadboards can make it much easier to wire circuits up without electrical tape or a soldering iron and are ideal for testing if you have everything wired up correctly. Plug the jumper wire connected to the ground into the (-) negative track, and plug the jumper wire connected to the button pin into the (+) positive track. As shown in the image, the red wire (connected to pin 26) is plugged into the positive track and the black wire (connected to ground) is plugged into the negative track., With a wire stripper, strip both ends of two different color wires. Plug one side of each wire into the corresponding track of the breadboard. As pictured, a red hook-up wire is plugged into the positive track of the breadboard and a white wire is plugged into the negative track of the breadboard.,,, Check to see if all the elements are working. In a new terminal window type:

/usr/local/src/boothy/run.sh

and press ↵ Enter. The camera preview will start up and you will see a number counting down. Get ready to smile! It will take 3 pictures and print the resulting photo set. When it says ""Press red button to begin!"" it should repeat the entire process the instant that the red button is pressed! Congratulations, you made a photo booth!, When you are ready to end the photo booth program, simply press Ctrl+C. This will end the program abruptly and take you back to the terminal window. Then press Ctrl+D to return back to the normal command prompt line., If you want to further customize the program, you can edit the file pbooth.py in the python editor. Open a new file manager window and navigate to the boothy directory. Double click on the file pbooth.py. This should open the pbooth.py code in the python editor., Click on ""File"" and the select ""Save As"" and save a new file called ""pbooth.py.bak"" as a backup file in case you change anything that will cause the python code not to work. If that does happen, simply delete the "".bak"" extension from the file and overwrite the broken file with it. This way you can feel safe experimenting with learning what each part of the code does!, If you inspect the code a little closer, you'll see there are some variables and terms that are defined near the top that make it a little easier to customize this to your needs.

PHOTO_DELAY      = 8




Some suggestions and tips:

Changing the values of SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT will determine the screen size the camera preview displays at. You can change this to match the resolution of the screen you will be using for your photobooth, however changing this may result in off-center titles for the text when the program is running. Those too can be changed but are more spread throughout the code so are harder to change.
If you are printing 4x6 sized prints, changing the values of IMAGE_WIDTH and IMAGE_HEIGHT to 640 and 425 respectively, utilizes the page space more effectively.
Changing the value ofPHOTO_DELAY which will determine how many seconds the timer counts down before each picture in a series.
Change or replace the 4logo.png in the boothy directory to something that is personalized for your event or celebration.

, There are lots of creative ways you could display your working photo booth and lots of examples on the internet of various installations people have made. Get creative and have fun!"

, To do this, you need to first right click on the bar for the axis and uncheck ""link deadzones."" Then, you use the little tabs below the bar to move the 2 boundaries of the deadzone a little bit to the side of either side of the red bar.

, However, it will seem that when you move the stick to the extremes of the axis, you will get more input on one side than the other. So, set up a deadzone the same way on the ends of the bar by pushing the stick all the way to that side, then setting a tab to just over where the red line is.

, Click ""apply"" and go to ""test"" on the top. Your axis should now be centered on the test screen, and when you put the stick to the extremes it will go right to the endpoints. Click ""ok"".

Removing this from your bookmark's name will make your bookmark list less cluttered.


You can choose alternate locations for your new bookmark as well. By default, it will be placed in the Bookmark Bar, but you can place it in a different folder.

PGP recognizes two digital formats: X.509 certificates and PGP certificates.
Share your public PGP keys with those recipients with whom you wish to share information. Ensuring that your network of senders and recipients of sensitive data all operate using similar PGP public keys will make PGP verification easier.;
,


There are several software options from freeware to military grade applications used to secure data across large corporate networks.
Test a few applicable software options to make the best choice for your organization. Before implementing a software solution company-wide, you may benefit from participating in testing programs to ensure usability and to develop best practices based on your needs.

,


You can establish one PGP certificate for your organization that includes the entire list of users that will share information.
Once you have established your list of public keys and data sharing protocol, you can begin developing methods to verify PGP.

,


There are manual as well as automated processes that CAs can use to verify PGP signatures. You will need to establish the best method for your company based on the information shared.
All senders and recipients of secure information will verify a PGP signature by using the primary public key (which must be accessible to all recipients) and adding it to their files.
Once information is sent and the applicable public keys have been exchanged, the software used will verify the PGP signature for received messages.

, PGP public keys can be used to verify digital signatures as well as to decrypt messages.


PGP Certificates are valid for an allotted time; in many corporate environments, users (employees, management) have to reset usernames and passwords after 30, 60 or 90 days to ensure that if identifiers or information has been compromised, precautions are in place to establish security.

Look for signs the website is secure.,
Don’t use your credit card on a public computer if you can help it.,
Avoid making transactions while connected to a public network.,
Turn down offers to save your card information.,
Ask your bank or card supplier about protection services.,
Shop with PayPal or similar services.,
Be on alert for phishing attempts.",How to Use a Credit Card Online1," Technology makes it easy for you to make purchases with your credit card online. Without proper security protocols, however, sensitive information like your credit card number can be swiped by cyber crooks. Most websites that take payments will have extra layers of security to block these thieves from getting your data. It’s easy to identify these sites: just look for an “https” at the front of the web address instead of a plain “https”.The “s” at the end of “https” signifies a “secure” website.
The lack of an “https” doesn’t necessarily mean that a site is not legitimate, but it does show that the website creators have taken extra precautions to secure your data.
You might also see certification seals like ""Verisign,"" ""TRUSTe"", “Norton Secured,” or “McAfee Secure.” These are nice to see on a legitimate website, but they don’t necessarily prove that a site is legitimate--they’re actually just images that anyone can copy and paste into a site.;
, Computers used in places like libraries and internet cafes can mean easy access to those on the go or without a computer at home. However, since they’re public, it’s easier for thieves to lift data like credit card numbers off of the computer. Even if you’re careful to log in and out of your accounts, your data could still be at risk. It’s best to do your bill-paying and online shopping on your own computer if possible., Even if you’re using your own computer, tablet, or other device, if you’re connected to an open, public wifi network (such as at a coffee shop), then your data is not 100% secure. Of course, most people aren’t crooks. But if you’re sharing a network, then you could also be “sharing” your sensitive data with a would-be thief. Try to save your online shopping and bill-paying for when you’re on a secure, password-protected, private network., When you create an account to pay a bill or shop online, you may be asked if you want to save your credit card information to make future transactions easier and faster. While this is certainly convenient, keeping your information stored online heightens the risk that it will be stolen if the website ever has a security breach. If possible, just say “no” to these offers. The minor convenience of having to re-enter your credit card number each time will be well-worth your peace of mind., Increasingly, credit card companies and banks are offering customers options to shop more securely online. To use your credit card online as safely as possible, you may want to take advantage of these options, some of which may have extra fees. If you’re not sure what’s available for your card, ask the issuer about things like:


Alerts for any suspicious charges.
One-time-use credit card numbers. A new card number is randomly generated for you each time you make a purchase, making it impossible for thieves to steal a number and use it again. These are sometimes called “virtual account numbers.”Masked credit cards. These go one step further, offering the ability to protect other sensitive data, such as by using a fake name and an alternate address., Many merchants make it possible to pay for goods and services online without actually entering your credit card information on their site. Instead, you create a third party account through another service, and can then use this account to make payments at a variety of sites.PayPal is probably the most popular of these services, but there are others, such as Visa Checkout.

, If you use a credit card online, you should be on the lookout for malicious emails, or phishing scams, designed by criminals to make it appear as though they come from your bank or credit card issuer. In reality, however, they are attempts to steal your information. If you are ever in doubt about the authenticity of an email that appears to be from your card issuer, give them a call to verify. In general, however, know that card issuers will never ask you to do certain things via email, such as:


Reply to an email with your credit card number
Enter your credit card number in a form embedded in the email
Click a link to get to your account (always go directly to the account website by typing in the web address).

Check your bank statements and credit report regularly.,
Report any cases of fraud.,
Take action to monitor and protect your finances.",How to Use a Credit Card Online2," Check that your credit report doesn’t contain any errors (such as accounts that you have closed), discrepancies (such as accounts you never opened), or other suspicious activity. Also, review your card statements or online account regularly to make sure that there are no charges that you didn’t make. Not only will this keep your credit report clear, it will also reveal if you have been a victim of fraud (such as a stolen card number).

, If you do encounter a confirmed or suspected instance where your credit card information has been stolen, don’t freak out. Call your bank or credit card issuer right away, and let them know what is going on. They will walk you through the next steps to report and deal with the fraud, which usually involves erasing any fraudulent charges, changing your credit card number, and monitoring your credit report for any future issues.


In almost all cases, you will only be liable for up to $50 of fraudulent charges, if anything at all.Banks and credit card issuers offer protection from liability, and most customers are not help responsible for any fraudulent charges at all.
Don’t be embarrassed if you are the victim of credit card fraud. Cyber criminals are clever, and online security is a constantly developing field., If your bank or credit card issuer does not already offer credit monitoring services after a case of fraud, make sure to do this yourself. Let the three major credit reporting agencies--Transunion, Experian, and Equifax--know that there has been a problem with your account. You can also visit the Federal Trade Commission’s Identity Theft Recovery website for more information about how to deal with any lingering issues."

Use the right kind of card.,
Enter your card information online.,
Know exactly what you are paying for.",How to Use a Credit Card Online3," When paying bills or shopping online, you will typically have the option to use several different kinds of cards: credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cash cards or gift cards, etc. While it is up to you to use the card that makes the most sense, keep in mind that credit cards typically offer more protection against liability for fraudulent charges. If possible, use a credit card for online purchase to ensure you are covered.Make sure you are able to use your credit card responsibly.

, When you make a transaction using your credit card online, be prepared to enter the necessary information, which includes the credit card number, expiration date, and security code, as well as your name, billing address, and email address. Some merchants and services may require you to create a personal account, others may give you the option to complete the transaction as a “guest.””One click” shopping is another convenient method of buying online that some websites offer, allowing you to purchase something with the click of a single button, as soon as you see it on a merchant’s website. Just keep in mind that each of these “clicks” charges your credit card!

, Sometimes, the convenience of buying online can get the better of us. It is a good idea to double-check the items you have in your “cart” before finalizing your purchase, to make sure you didn’t accidently add items you don’t want, for instance. Most merchants will do this for you, by giving you the option to “review” your transaction before finalizing the transaction and charging your credit card.Expect honest merchants to send you a confirmation of your purchase via email or to show a confirmation on the website after you complete the transaction. Treat this like a receipt, and keep a copy for your records.

Select 'I want to Stream' to watch videos.,

Make Better Use of the Dashboard.,
Tweak Settings to Better Suit your Needs.",How to Use PureVPN to Enhance Online Security and Anonymity,"

For those who are more specifically interested in streaming videos, the mode will do much more than suffice. It ensures users get access to unlimited streaming from anywhere around the globe. But most importantly, they can do so without having to worry about being tracked or monitored.;
,

The mode in particular will appeal to those who wish to access multiple sites, this includes that are restricted as well. Instead of having to go through the hassle of changing the mode each and every time, 'Internet Freedom' will allow users to do exactly what they want to do on the internet with ease.

,

There are quite a few platforms out there that actually allow anonymous file sharing. Fortunately, the app is one of the few that allows users to do just that. Additionally, its anonymous file sharing feature ensures only the sender and receiver have access to whatever is being sent or received.

,

For those concerned about their security, especially their data, they should select the following mode instead. What it does is that it ensures that a user's security is at an all time high, which in turn improves data privacy. In other words, once the mode kicks in, it will make it impossible for hackers to gain access to confidential information or files.

,

There are certain regions which allow access to exclusive content, not only does this mode ensure users are able to access that region's content, but they can greatly enhance their online security at the same time. Users can at any time choose a dedicated IP, and this freedom in turn has countless applications that benefit individuals and businesses alike.

,

Users are not necessarily restricted to the aforementioned five modes, and can in fact take advantage of other features like being able to choose their purpose for online freedom. Depending on a user's requirement, they can choose an appropriate purpose, like 'Online Gaming' for instance, in which case the app will automatically trigger the required VPN protocols to cater to those requirements.

,

Some Content is made available earlier in some regions before others, and in this case the following option can be of great use to users who wish to get access to said content with ease. Furthermore, there are instances when exclusive content is not made available to other regions, in which case the app's said feature can allow users to access restricted content without any hassles whatsoever.

,

When it comes to browsing speed and security, users are mostly restricted to what is available to them. However, with the app users can choose an appropriate VPN protocol that best fits their requirements. Not only will this enhance speed and security, but users are free to choose how said app works for them as they have complete control over each and every feature available.

,

Depending on what you need to do , select the appropriate mode. The mode screen is presented when PureVPN is installed for the very first time, but it can be accessed later on by clicking on the menu icon on the top right hand side of the PureVPN's app. Choose from any of the five modes available to further enhance your browsing experience.

,

After selecting the appropriate mode, there are plenty of ways to go about improving your online experience. To make this possible, you should make better use of the PureVPN app's dashboard. If you wish to access content for a specific region, you can choose it from 'Select Location'. To simplify things even more, you can choose 'Select Purpose', that is if you are clear about what needs to be done or accessed online.

,

PureVPN's app has been designed to give users more control over its core functions. Keeping this in mind, there is no harm in tweaking its settings to better suit your purpose. These Settings can be accessed by clicking the menu, after which users can select the appropriate protocols, change their credentials and enable/disable other settings like launch the app on system startup, enable/disable tips, redial automatically when the connection drops and syncing favorites. Users can further tweak the app by selecting 'Advanced Options', which includes features like:

Switch to secure DNS

Decide if cloud storage is right for you.,
Pick a cloud storage service.,
Upload the file you want to share.,
Generate a link to your file.,
Copy and paste the link into an email.,
Instruct the recipient to download the file.",How to Send Large Files to Another Computer Using the Internet1," Cloud storage services are remote servers that will store your files online for you so that they can be accessed anywhere. You can share links to these files to anyone you want, and they can then download the file from your cloud storage account.Most cloud storage services allow you to store at least 5 GB of files for free, with some services offering significantly more storage space.
There is rarely a practical limit to the size of the file you can transfer using cloud storage.;
, There are a variety of cloud storage services available, and they all offer similar services when it comes to file transferring. You may already have an account with one and not realize it!


Google Drive - This is Google's free cloud storage service, and every Gmail account gets 15 GB of storage. You can access it at drive.google.com by logging in with your Gmail account.
OneDrive - This is Microsoft's cloud storage service, and a Microsoft (Hotmail, Outlook.com) account comes with 15 GB of free storage. You can access it at onedrive.live.com by logging in with your Microsoft account.
DropBox - This is an independent cloud storage service. Free accounts come with 2 GB of storage, which can be increased through referrals. You can sign up at dropbox.com.
Box - This is another independent cloud storage service. Free accounts come with 10 GB of storage, but are limited to files 250 MB or smaller. You can create an account at box.com/personal.
Mediafire - This is a file-sharing service that has evolved into a cloud storage provider. Unlike the other cloud storage services here, it is geared more towards sharing files as opposed to storing them. Free accounts come with 10 GB of storage, with ads on any download links you share. Free accounts no longer have a file-size restriction (it used to be 200 MB). You can get started at mediafire.com


, Before you can send the file to someone else, you'll need to upload it to your cloud service. The process for this varies depending on the service you are using, but generally you can simply sign into your cloud service account through your web browser and then drag the file into the browser window.


Many cloud storage services have mobile apps that allow you to upload files from your smartphone or tablet.
Some cloud services such as Google Drive and DropBox create a sync folder on your computer. Adding a file or folder to the sync folder will automatically upload it to your cloud storage.
The amount of time it takes the file to upload will depend on your internet connection speed. Files that are a GB or more could take over an hour to upload.

, once your file is uploaded, you can generate a link that you can then send to whoever you want to share the file with. Again, the process varies depending on the service you are using, but you can usually simply select the file and click the ""Share"" or ""Get Link"" option.

, Anyone with the link you generate can access the file and download it to their own computers. Paste the link into an email, and then send it to whoever you want to give the file to.


Your email service may be able to easily include links to files on your cloud storage service. For example, when you are composing a Gmail message, you can include a link to a Google Drive file. If you are composing as Hotmail email, you can include a link to your OneDrive files.

, When the recipient clicks the link you send them, it will typically open the file in the cloud service's online viewer. For example, if you share a video with OneDrive, the video will open in OneDrive's online video player when the recipient clicks the link. They can download the video to their computer by clicking the ""Download"" button.

Compress multiple files into a single archive.,
Find the right file-sharing service for you.,
Upload the file that you want to to share.,
Generate a link to the file.,
Share the link.",How to Send Large Files to Another Computer Using the Internet2," These services act similarly to cloud storage services, but they're designed more for sharing files as opposed to storing them. You simply upload the file that you want to transfer to someone, and then send them the link to the file. You typically don't need any accounts, and you can usually share the file with multiple people.Since you are uploading the file to a server that's not under your control, you should probably avoid using this method to transfer sensitive material.
File-sending services are great if you need a one-time transfer and don't want to deal with a cloud storage service.

, Most file-sending services only allow you to upload one file at a time, and typically don't support folders. If you need to transfer multiple files to someone, add them all to a ZIP archive so that you can send them as a single file. ZIP is a universally supported format, so you won't need to worry about your recipient being able to extract the files.



Click here for instructions on creating a ZIP file.
Compressing the files allows you to add a password to them if you're worried about the links falling into unknown hands.

, There are a huge number of file-sending and file-sharing services available, so picking the right one can be tough. Below are a few of the most popular services, as well as some of their specific benefits and uses:WeTransfer (wetransfer.com)- This is one of the most popular file-sending services, which means that it immediately generates and sends an email with the link to your file. You can also just generate a link to the file if you'd prefer. You can upload files up to 2 GB without creating an account.
MailBigFile (free.mailbigfile.com/)- This is a service that is very similar to WeTransfer. You can upload and share files up to 2 GB for free accounts, and files will last 20 downloads or 10 days.
Mega (mega.co.nz) - This is a popular file-sharing service based out of New Zealand. Free accounts come with 50 GB of space, and you can easily create links for your files. Mega also offers encryption for files.
DropSend (dropsend.com)- This is another file transfer service like WeTransfer or MailBigFile. DropSend supports files up to 4 GB in size for the free account and encrypts all files sent. Recipients have seven days to use the download link that is generated before the file is deleted.

, Most services allow you to simply drag the file into the browser window, though you may need to browse your computer for the file.


Depending on the service, you may or may not be able to upload a folder to share.

, Once the file has been uploaded, you will be provided with a link that you can distribute to the people you are sharing with. You may be able to set additional sharing options, such as specific users or password protection.

, You can email or message the link to whomever you would like to share the file with. The link will stay active for as long as the service you chose dictates in their account settings.

Decide if BitTorrent is the way to go.,
Install a torrent client on your computer.,
Create a torrent file.,
Distribute the torrent file.,
Keep your computer on, your torrent client open, and don't move the file.,
Wait until the torrent has been seeded before stopping or deleting.",How to Send Large Files to Another Computer Using the Internet3," BitTorrent is a method for transferring large files across the internet. It differs from cloud storage because the other person will be downloading the file directly from your computer; it is not uploaded to any server first. BitTorrent can also provide much faster transfer speeds for the recipient than cloud storage.


If you're trying to share the large file with as many people as possible, BitTorrent may be the best bet. Anyone that has a part of the file will share it with others that are trying to download it. This allows large numbers of people to share a file without putting strain on a server. As long as one person with the file is running a torrent client, anyone can download the file.
BitTorrent requires a little more work than cloud storage or file-sending services, because it requires all participants to have a BitTorrent client installed, as well as a basic understanding of how torrents work. It also requires that at least one person with the whole copy of the file be connected at all times.

, This is a program that facilitates the connection between you and anyone else sharing the file.


qBittorrent is one of the most popular, lightweight clients. You can get it from qbittorrent.org.

, Open the torrent creation tool in your torrent client. You can usually press Ctrl+N to open the torrent creation wizard.


Add the file that you want to share with others. If you want to share multiple files at once, consider creating a folder and then adding that folder to the torrent.
Paste a few trackers into the ""Trackers"" field. Trackers are URLs that are required for new connections to the torrent, as it contains the updated list of all the current connections. There are several free trackers that you can use, and including more will help keep your torrent alive longer:

udp://open.demonii.com:1337
udp://exodus.desync.com:6969
udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969
udp://tracker.pomf.se
udp://tracker.blackunicorn.xyz:6969
udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969


Save the torrent file. You will be asked to give it a name and pick a spot on your computer to save it to.

, Now that the torrent has been created, send the torrent file to everyone that you want to share the files with. Remember that each person will need their own torrent client in order to download the file from you.


Torrent files are very small, and can easily be attached to email messages.

, Now that you've distributed the file, you'll need to keep it available for people to start downloading. This means keeping your computer on and your torrent client open.


If you move the file while you're sharing it, no one will be able to download it. This is because the file is being downloaded straight from its location on your hard drive.

, Depending on how many people you're sharing with, you may not have to wait long for at least one other person to have the entire file. This will allow you to stop sharing, or ""seeding"", if you'd like. Of course, if you want to ensure availability of the file, you should continue seeding.


When a torrent is shared with a lot of people, it quickly becomes seeded, as all of the parts are available from a wide number of different users. This is how torrents survive without having a central server.

Upload the file to an FTP server.,
Split the file into multiple smaller pieces.",How to Send Large Files to Another Computer Using the Internet4," If you and your recipients have access to an FTP (file transfer protocol) server, you can upload the file to it and then they can download it through an FTP client of their browser.

, You can use third-party compression programs like WinRAR and 7-Zip to create multi-part archives. The recipient can then download each smaller file and then combine them into one archive, which can then be opened to access the contents. The biggest downside to this method is that the recipient will need the same program that you used to create the parts, as well as some basic knowledge of how to combine the pieces.

Close the connection.",How to Use FTP," FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, and is a connection method designed for transferring files from a remote server to local computer, and vice versa. While HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) allows for file transfers, it is not as robust as FTP transfers. FTP is often used in corporate and academic settings, and is the primary way of managing webpage servers.;
, When you come across FTP addresses on a webpage, they are usually denoted in the same way, though there are variations. For example, you might see ftp.example.com:21. This means that the host is ftp.example.com and the port is 21. You will need both of these when connecting to the FTP server. If the FTP requires a username, it may be written as username@ftp.example.com:21.If no username is specified, then you will usually need to enter ""anonymous"" as the username when you connect. Note that you are not actually anonymous when you connect to a public FTP.

, There are three main ways to connect to FTP servers: visual clients, browser-based, or through the command line. Downloading and installing a visual client is the most widely used and easiest way to connect to an FTP, and also affords you the most power and control over the process.


The majority of this guide will focus on using an FTP client. If you're interested in how to connect to an FTP using the command line, see the final section of this guide.
To connect to an FTP through a web browser, simply enter the FTP address into the address bar just like any other website. You may be asked for login credentials, and then you can browse the directories. Using a browser is usually much slower and less reliable than using a designated client.

, Using a client to connect will often lead to faster uploads and downloads to the FTP server. FTP clients also include a lot of useful features, such as the ability to save server addresses and file queuing. There are a variety of clients available, both for free and purchase. One of the most popular free and open-source clients available is FileZilla.


FileZilla can be downloaded for Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux from the website, filezilla-project.org.

, Once you install the client, you can open it to begin connecting to the FTP server of your choice. If you are using FileZilla, you will have two different options for connecting: Quickconnect or the Site Manager.


The Quickconnect bar allows you to enter the FTP information for servers that you do not regularly use. Enter the address into the ""Host"" field, your username into the ""Username"" field, your password into the ""Password"" field, and the server's port into the ""Port"" field. The Quickconnect history list only stores the last 10 connections.
The Site Manager allows you to store multiple servers for future use, and allows you to set many more options for the connection. Click the Site Manager button in the upper-left corner of the window, underneath the File menu. Click the ""New Site"" button, and then fill out the server information in the ""General"" tab. The ""Advanced"" tab allows you to change your default directories and adjust the server timezone. Use the Site Manager if you need to set custom settings or plan on connecting to the server often.

, Select the server you want to connect to from the Site Manager dropdown menu, or enter the server information into the Quickconnect bar and click the ""Quickconnect"" button. Your client will then attempt to connect to the server based on the information you entered. You will see the details of the connection process in the top frame of the FileZilla window.

, Once you are connected, you will see the FTP directory tree on the right side of the window. The top frame shows the tree structure, while the bottom frame shows the contents of each folder. Each time you change folders, a small command is sent to the server. This means there will be a slight delay when moving between folders. You can enter in an exact location in the bar at the top of the right side.


If you don't have permission for certain directories, you will receive an error when you try to access them.

, On the left side of the window, you will see two frames for navigating through your local folders. This will allow you to choose files to upload or locations for downloads. You can type in an exact location in the bar at the top of the right side.

, Navigate to the file or folder that you want to download on the right side of the window. Navigate to the location that you want to save it on the left side of the window. Click and drag the file from the bottom frame on the right to the bottom frame on the left. Your file or folder will start transferring automatically.


You can see the size of the file in bytes in the ""Filesize"" column.
You can select multiple files to download in the same session by holding Ctrl and clicking on each one you want. Files will be transferred one at a time.
You can add files to your download queue by right-clicking on them and selecting ""Add files to queue""

, Navigate to the file or folder that you want to upload on the left side of the window. Navigate to the location that you want to upload it to on the right side of the window. If you have permissions to upload a file to the FTP server, you can click and drag the file from the left side to the right side to begin uploading.


Most public FTPs will not allow anonymous users to upload files.
Uploads will typically take longer than downloads of the same size.

, You can watch your transfers in the bottom frame of the window. You will see a list of files you are transferring and have queued, along with their size, priority, and percent completion. You can see your failed and completed transfers by using the tabs at the bottom of the window.

, Install the server software on the computer that you want to act as the server. If you are running the server for your own personal use, you can probably just use a spare old computer as the server. If you are setting up an FTP server for a corporate setting or for a team to use, you will likely want to ensure that you have a dedicated machine with a solid internet connection.


FileZilla has a free open-source server version of its software that is highly recommended for almost any FTP server application, except for when the highest degree of security is required.
If you plan on making your FTP server available on a 24/7 basis, you will need a dynamic DNS service that will ensure that people always have the correct address for your server, even if the IP address changes.

, When you first start the FileZilla server software, you will be prompted to connect to a server. By default, the ""Server Address"" will be set to 127.0.0.1. This points to the local computer. You shouldn't need to change these settings unless you are managing a server on another computer. In that case, it would be more efficient to install the server software on that computer instead.

, FTPs allow you to create different users with different permissions. This allows you to set folders to only be viewable by certain people, or create different areas on the server for different teams. Without users set, no one could connect to the server.


In FileZilla, click the Edit menu and select Users.
Click the Add button and create a name for the first user.
Check the ""Enable password"" box if you want to require a password for the connection. This is highly recommended for security purposes.
Multiple users can be placed into groups, which allows for further customization of permissions.

, Once a user has been created, you will need to set the folders that the user will automatically be taken to when they are logged in. Click the ""Shared folders"" page, and then click the ""Add"" button to browse for a directory on your computer. When you choose a directory, that directory will be set as the Home Directory for the user.


By default, the user will have access to all of the subdirectories in a directory. You can change this by unchecking the ""+ Subdirs"" box.
If you set multiple directories as shared for a user, they will need to have aliases set. This will allow them to appear as two directories in the same location for a user. For example, if C:\users\Pictures is the Home Directory and you want to C:\Music, you will need to set the alias for C:\Music to /music. This will make the folder /music appear in the Home Directory, pointing to the C:\Music folder., In the Shared Folders page, you can set the permissions that each user or group has for that specific folder. By default, users will only have ""Read"" access, which allows them to download from the shared folder. If ""Write"" access is granted, the user can upload files to that shared folder. If the ""Delete"" permission is granted, then the user can delete anything in that shared folder.

, If you want to allow anyone to connect to your FTP server, create a user named ""anonymous"" and leave the password blank. Make sure the anonymous user does not have access to any sensitive files, and that all the other users are properly password-protected.


Anonymous users should rarely, if never, have Delete or Write access to an FTP.

, By default, your FTP server is running once the program starts up. This means that once your users and permissions are all sorted, you can start distributing login information and letting people connect. If you are running the FTP from your home, you will want to set up a dynamic DNS service, as your IP address is likely to change. This will allow people to connect to your server using a hostname instead of the IP address (for example: ftp.example.net vs. 243.284.172.64).


This option costs money, but is very useful if you have lots of people connecting and don't want to have to resend out the IP address every time it changes. See this guide for more details.

, Windows, Mac OS X, and most Linux distributions have a command-based FTP client available from the Command Prompt or Terminal.


To open the Windows Command Prompt, press ⊞ Win+R and type cmd.
To open the Terminal in most Linux distributions, press Ctrl+Alt+T.
To open the Terminal in OS X, open the Applications → Utilities folder and select Terminal.

, The commands are the same for all command line FTP clients regardless of operating system. To connect to the server, type ftp ftp.example.com. After the connection is made, you will be prompted for the username. If you are connecting to a public FTP, type anonymous and press Enter when prompted for the password. Otherwise, enter in your assigned username and password., The FTP is navigated much the same way that any traditional Unix system is navigated. See this guide for detailed instructions on changing directories, or this guide for information on creating directories.

, By default, the FTP will connect in ASCII mode, which is designed for transferring text files. If you want to upload or download archives, executable files, or media files. To switch to binary mode, type binary and press ↵ Enter.

, Use the get command to download a file from the remote server to your local computer. Follow the ""get"" command with the file you want to download. For example, type get example.jpg to download the ""example.jpg"" from the current location on the FTP.

, Use the put command to upload a file from your local machine onto the remote FTP server. Follow the ""put"" command with the location of the file that you want to upload. For example, type put c:\documents\homemovies\example2.avi to copy the ""example2.avi"" movie file from it's home location to the FTP server.

, Type close to end the connection with the FTP client. Any transfers currently in progress will be canceled."

If you're going to be uploading a lot of files and need features like queuing and upload resuming, you'll want to use an FTP client to connect to the server., There are tons of FTP clients out there, some of which are free and some that cost money. One of the most popular free clients is FileZilla, which is an open-source FTP client available at filezilla-project.org and can be installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

, When you start your FTP client, you'll need to create a new connection profile. This will save your connection information, allowing you to quickly reconnect in the future.


Enter the FTP address, your user name, and your password (if required). Most FTP servers run on port 21, so you won't have to change this value unless specified by the server.

, Once you've entered in all of your information, you can connect to the FTP server. You'll see the connection log in the status section of the client as your computer contacts and connects to the server.

, Many FTP servers restrict uploads from users to specific folders. Refer to your FTP server's documentation to see what folder you have permission to upload to. Use the right panel to navigate through the FTP's folders.

, The left panel in the FTP client shows your local computer's directories. Navigate through the folders to find the files you want to upload.

, Either double-click a file to begin uploading it, or drag it from the left panel to the right panel.

, The upload progress will be displayed in the bottom panel of the FTP window. Wait until your upload has completed before disconnecting from the FTP server.

Check that you have permission to run (or) execute the file.
,
Execute permission is denoted by the letter 'x', while ‘r’ denotes read permission and ‘w’ denotes write permission

If you are the owner of the file, you can grant yourself execute permission by using the ‘chmod’ command.,
Execute the file

To execute the file, go to the directory where the file is and then invoke the file using the relative path.",How to Run a File in Unix,", Below example shows the file ‘file.sh’ before and after granting execute permission



 



,






Or, you can also execute the file using the full path or absolute path.
Sometimes, you may want to execute the file in a different shell in order to obtain the special behaviour of that shell. In such cases, the specified shell will start as a subshell of your current shell and execute the file. In the example below, we have executed the file.sh first using the BASH shell, then using the C shell and finally, using the KORN shell.

All Google accounts come with 15 GB of Google Drive storage. You can log in or create an account at drive.google.com.
Free Dropbox accounts come with 2 GB of storage, plenty of space to upload and share some albums.
There are plenty of other cloud storage services that offer similar features if you don't want to use Drive or Dropbox. The process will be pretty much the same.;
, Uploading files is a snap for both Google Drive and Dropbox. Simply drag the ZIP file into the browser window that has your account open. The file will begin uploading to your account immediately.


Depending on the size of the ZIP file and the speed of your internet connection, the upload process could take a few minutes or several hours. Upload speeds are almost always slower than download speeds.

, This will open the link-sharing window.

, If you're using Google Drive, you'll need to click ""Get shareable link"" first. This link is a direct link to the ZIP file that you've uploaded.

, Once you've copied the link, you can send it to your friends via email or chat. When they click the link, they'll be prompted to download the ZIP file to their computer.If you want to text the link, you'll probably need to use a URL shortener so that it will fit in a message.
This method is best used to share a ZIP with just a few people. If too many people start downloading your file, you'll likely raise some eyebrows and action may be taken against your account. If you want to share your music with a lot of people, see one of the following methods.
If you've password-protected the ZIP file, make sure to give the password to your friends.

Seed the file until your friends have it.",How to Share Music3," You don't necessarily need to create a ZIP file when you're making a torrent, since the entire folder will be downloaded with the torrent file. Just make sure all of the files you want to share are in a folder (there can be subfolders).


Note that this method will technically make your shared files public. Other users will need to know that the file is available, so the chances of other users joining in is slim, but it is possible.

, You'll need a torrent client to create the torrent file and ""seed"" it so that others can download it. One of the most popular free torrent clients is qBittorent (qbittorrent.org).

, All torrent clients come with the ability to create torrents. You can usually open the torrent creator from the Tools or File menu, or you can press Ctrl+N (Windows) or ⌘ Cmd+N (Mac).

, If you created a ZIP file, select it instead.

, These are lists of users that allow the torrent client to connect to people sharing the file. You'll need at least one tracker listed for others to connect to you. Below are some of the most popular free, open trackers. Add a few or all of them to the field:


udp://tracker.pomf.se
udp://tracker.blackunicorn.xyz:6969
udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969
udp://open.demonii.com:1337
udp://exodus.desync.com:6969
udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969

, This will add the torrent to your client so that users with the torrent file can connect to you and begin downloading.

, After you're finished adding trackers, you can create and save the torrent file to your computer. Make sure you save it to a location that you can easily find.


Since you've checked the ""Start seeding"" box, you should see the torrent appear in your transfer list. The progress will say ""100% (Seeding)"", since you have all of the files.

, Now that the torrent has been created and you're seeding it, you'll need to distribute the torrent file to your friends. The file is quite small, and is required in order to connect to you and download the files.


Since the file is small, you can attach it to an email without any worries about the size limits.
Your friends will need torrent clients in order to connect to you.

, Make sure that you don't move any of the files while you're seeding, or the torrent clients won't be able to download. Ask your friends to keep seeding after they finish downloading so that you don't have to seed for everyone. As more of your friends connect, all of their downloads will become faster.For more information on creating and sharing torrents, click here.

Learn more about FTP.",How to Share Music5," FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, and allows users to connect directly to the FTP server and select which files they want to download from it. By turning your computer into an FTP server, you will be able to securely share your entire music collection with your friends and allow them to pick and choose what they want to download.


You can turn any computer into an FTP server. It will need to be turned on, connected to the internet, and have the server software running in order for your friends to connect to it.

, You'll need this later on when you're setting up the server.


Open the Command Prompt. You can find this in the Start menu, or you can start it by pressing ⊞ Win+R and typing cmd.






Type ipconfig and press↵ Enter.






Note the IPv4 Address entry for your network adapter.







, There are lots of options for doing this. One of the most popular options is FileZilla, which is a free, open-source FTP program. The FileZilla server software is Windows-only.


You can download the FileZilla server software from filezilla-project.org.

, In order for someone to connect to your FTP, they'll need to log in using a user account. You can create one user account and distribute the information to all of your friends. Multiple people can be connected at the same time using one account.


Click the Edit menu and select ""Users"".






Click Add underneath the Users list and give the user a name. Remember that you can have multiple people use the same user, so you could just name it something like ""guest"".







, Click the Add button underneath the ""Shared folders"" list. This will allow you to select what folders the user has access to. Set it to the folder containing all of your music, and they will gain access to all of the subfolders as well.

, Enter in a password that you want to use for the user you just created. This will help ensure that only the users you want are able to access your files.

, Chances are that you're connecting to the internet from behind a router. If FileZilla displays the message ""You appear to be behind a NAT router. Please configure the passive mode settings and forward a range of ports in your router"", you'll need to set up port forwarding by following these steps. If you don't see this message, skip down to Step 16.

, This will open the FileZilla Options menu, where you'll be configuring your port settings.

, This menu will allow you to set your port forwarding settings for FileZilla.

, Enter a range of ports in the 50000-port range. Make sure the ports you enter are less than 65535. The range should be about 50 ports (e.g. 55700-55750).

, This will automatically determine your server's external IP address.

, Most routers can be accessed by entering their address into a web browser's address bar. The most common browser addresses are 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, and 192.168.2.1. You'll need to enter your administrator username and password.

, This may be located in different areas depending on the model of router you are using. Check the ""Advanced"" section if you can't find it.

, You'll need to create a new port forwarding rule to open the ports for your FTP server. Enter in the range of ports that you set earlier. In the ""IP address"" field, enter in the IP address for your computer that you found in Step 2. Click here for more information on forwarding ports., If you use Windows Firewall, you'll need to open the same ports in it as well.


Press ⊞ Win and type firewall. Select ""Windows Firewall"" from the list of results.






Click the ""Advanced settings"" link in the left menu.






Select ""Inbound Rules"" in the left menu, and then click ""New Rule"" in the right frame.






Select ""Port"" and then click Next >.
Enter the ports you opened in your router into the ""Specific local ports"" field. Follow the rest of the prompts to save the new rule.

, Your server will need to be running in order for your friends to connect to it. By default, FileZilla will start automatically when you log into Windows.

, Your friends will need this address to connect to the server. You can find your public IP address by opening Google and searching for ""my ip"". Your public IP address will be displayed at the top of the list of results.

, Your friends will need the username and password to connect to the FTP server. Make sure to let them know not to share the login information with anyone you don't want connecting. Unless you know your friends' IP addresses, you won't be able to tell who's connecting.


You will also need to give your friends the IP address and port that the FTP is using. If you didn't change the FTP port, it will be ""21"".

, FTP is a fairly complex protocol, and it can be powerful if you know how to use it to your advantage. Click here for detailed information on getting the most out of FTP.

, This is where you can change sharing options and security permissions for users on your system.,,, This will give you permission to add a new account to the system.

, Here’s how to configure the account so it’s used only for sharing:


Click the “+” to add a new account.
Select “Sharing Only” from the “New Account” menu.
Select “Use separate password” rather than the cloud option.
Enter a username and password for the account.
Click “Create User.” When Windows users access the shared folder, they’ll need to use this username and password to log in.

,, A navigation window will appear.,, Here you’ll see options for file sharing protocols.

,, If you will never need to share with a Windows computer on your network, you can skip this step.

,, A list of user accounts and groups will appear.

, Select the user account you just created, and then select either “Read,” “Read and Write,” or “Write” from the list on the right.


Choose “Read & Write” if you want the Windows users to be able to read, edit, and delete items in this folder.Choose “Write” if you want users to be able to use this folder as a “drop box” but not be able to edit or delete files.
Alternatively, you can leave this on “Read” so nobody else can modify the folder.

, By default, all users on the network (the “Everyone” group) have Read access. This means they can view files in the shared folder but not make changes. To change this:


Click to select “Everyone” in the Users list.
Choose “Read & Write” from the right panel if you want users on the network to view, edit, and delete files in this folder.
Select “Write” to use this folder as a “drop box,” so that people can copy files there but not view or modify anything.
Alternatively, you can leave this on “Read” so nobody else can modify the folder.

, Now that the folder is shared, any user on your network should be able to locate it in Finder beneath “Shared.”If the folder does not appear under “Shared,” browse the network by double-clicking “All…” and the folders should appear.

, If you enabled SMB for Windows users, here’s how to locate the address to which they’ll connect:Open System Preferences
Open the Sharing pane.
Make note of the IP address that starts with “smb” (e.g. smb://172.1.1.1).
Windows users will connect to this address in a web browser and log in with the account you created earlier. They’ll be able to view any files shared with that user upon a successful login.

, This is described above. Only this time, instead of doing a ping on a known address, we're going to run a whois check.


In your terminal window, by the flashing cursor, type whois 66.220.155.163, and press Enter. The information will be sent out to a database, queried, and then returned with the registration information for that IP address.

, You may not want to use the terminal, or perhaps it's not loaded on your computer. Instead, you can try using an Internet lookup, such as ip-lookup, which gives you much the same information as a whois lookup, and in many cases, much more.

Ask yourself: do they require you to pay money up front?,
Ask yourself: do they promise that you will become rich overnight?,
Ask yourself: what's in it for them?,
Ask yourself: how are they making money?,
Another sign of a scam is a buy-now statement like ""I can't keep this information online forever, so you have 3 hours to make your choice."",
In almost every single case, if you order the scam, you will discover that you'll get a how-to for creating your own scam, which can open yourself up to legal issues and your internet account being investigated and terminated.

,
Truth is, scammers usually don't get rich on their scams, either.",How to Spot an Online Scam," If they are requiring any sort of up front payment to use their services, it is almost always a scam. Many of them will claim that it's for the cost of training, etc. Most of that is just lies. More often than not, the scammer will take your money and run.;
, Let's face it. Very, very few of us are ever going to make thousands of dollars each day. However, scammers prey on our hopes and dreams of being rich without moving a finger. They tell us that our dreams can come true, but only if we do what they tell us to do. Our emotions shove aside logic, and we want to believe what they say, even if they are shady characters. Thus, the scammer's greatest weapon is you. Always keep your logic handy.

, Are they trying to help us out of the goodness of their own hearts? Are they making a selfless sacrifice of their time to help us become rich beyond your wildest dreams? Not likely. Very few people in the online community are going to volunteer vast amounts of their time and effort just to help someone else succeed. Most of the time, they are doing it for their own benefit. When we ask this question, we have to see through the lies. We need to recognize the reason behind false statements. For example, when they say that we could earn ""$1000/day"", they actually just want to draw us into their web. Their ultimate goal is for us to give them money in the form of an up front ""registration fee.""

, There are only two different ways that websites can make money from you: independently of you or dependent on you. In other words, websites making money independently of you don't need you to succeed for them to succeed. On the other hand, websites making money dependently on you need you to succeed in order for them to succeed. A website dependent on you for their own well-being is much less likely to be a scam, since they cannot survive if you don't make money. They will have more incentive to help you make money, rather than hurt you.

, Creating a feeling of scarcity helps make the item seem more valuable. Sometimes the website *does* go dark after a day or so ... but that's probably because it was pulled by the web hoster for being an illegal scam.

,, There are a few who do, just like there are a few small businesses that make it big.

Choose strong passwords.,
Avoid clicking on email links.,
Avoid adding unnecessary filters and firewalls.,
Install adequate malware protection.,
Stay updated.",How to Tackle Cyber Attacks," Although it's easy to remember the last digits of your credit card, your birthday, or your social security number, these identifying digits can lead to a lot of trouble if someone discovers your password. Avoid using them in conjunction with other words or phrases that can easily be linked to you, as well, because a professional computer hacker will likely be able to guess your password in a short period of time.


Never use common words or phrases, such as ""password,"" as this can be an open invitation for attackers. Instead, opt for a combination of upper and lowercase letters, along with a blend of numbers.
Be sure to change your password at least once every six months to keep your personal information as protected as you possibly can.
Write the updated passwords down on a sheet of paper rather than putting them into a Word Document or similar program, as an attack could easily reveal your security information to the wrong people.;
, You receive a new message in your inbox, and the source appears to be legitimate. At the bottom of the email is a line asking you to click on the following link to verify your Social Security Number for the new bank account you opened last month. Thinking the bank wants to verify your identity, you click on the link. However, you probably just exposed your information to a cyber criminal. Many people receive lots of emails throughout the day. Although some email is clearly a scam, with unreal promises or poor grammar, others can be quite convincing. However, you should never click on a link enclosed inside an email.


If you believe that the link is legitimate, visit the website directly. Once you log in, any valid offer will appear. If the offer does not appear, you know that it is likely a scam.

, Filters and firewalls can be great defenses against unwanted attacks. However, adding them to the wrong platform is not a good idea. This is explained in an article from Security Week, "". . . adding filters and firewalls to insecure platforms are like attaching padlocks to a screen door."" Any seasoned criminal will be able to find a way into such a platform. Upon doing so, these filters and firewalls can make the platform even more vulnerable which, in turn, provides the criminal with all the access to your information that he or she needs.

, When your computer is in use, it is constantly being subjected to the threat of malware, Trojans, spyware, adware, and more. This is a frightening thought, but having the right malware protection can prevent damage before it happens.


Some must-have malware protection software are Immunet Plus, Malwarebytes, Spyhunter, Norton 360, etc. These types of software can help to remove assorted files and anything else you don't want on your system in the first place. Having a solid malware protection system for your computer can prevent attacks by malware, whether it's new or has been around for years.

, Having the latest products and tools will only go so far if they are not updated. As attacks continue to advance and attackers constantly come up with innovative new ways to break into a computer's system, updates need to be made to anti-malware software. Otherwise, your computer could be subjected to an attack once the criminal finds the weak spot in the software.


It is best to get software that automatically installs the updates for you, so that you don't forget or let the update slide before it's too late. It can take a long time to recover from a cyber attack, which is why it's important to stop it before it happens.
Every computer is vulnerable to such an attack, but having the right tools and resources can go a long way when it comes to computer defense. You can get started by installing a solid anti-malware program and ensuring that it remains up to date.

Always read the ""terms and conditions"" before you accept or sign up for anything.,

Be careful if an advertisement comes with success quotes and post from other people ""just like you"".,
Beware of pages full of red text and yellow highlighting.",How to Spot Advertising Scams on the Internet," If there are no ""terms and conditions"" listed or to be found then ask for them. Doing this will help you greatly in the long run because many internet advertising scams you can sign up for will start to charge you after a period of time even though they advertise as ""absolutely free"". Usually it is free for the first few weeks or month, but after that they automatically bill you for their services.;
, These get rich quick scams never work out and at the end, people who sign up for them usually have less money then what they started out with. If it is so easy to become wealth, then everyone would already be doing it and there would be no need to advertise about it.

, Even if you do not think it is a scam, you should always double check by doing a simple Google search for the product or service that is being offered. If it is a scam then unfortunately other people have already fallen for it and most of them will post about it, in detail, on the Internet.

, Usually these people work for the company providing the product or service, or have some financial gain if you sign up for it. If you find the advertisement in a forum or on a blog and people are commenting on the quality and performance about the product or service, be careful, it may be a disguised sales pitch.





, A very large number of scams use this style on their pages. Pages that look like this are almost always scams. Also note the Photoshopped books and CDs. The downloadable information this site sells has probably never been printed and bound, nor ever distributed on CD.

A password should be strong, don't set your password to your username, the word ""password"", or the name of your dog. Even something like ""cornflakes21"" is easy for a password breaker to guess. Try not to include any words in the dictionary. Instead, try using an acronym, such as your initials + all the digits of your birth date added together + random punctuation and letters throughout. So, if John M. Smith was born October 14, 1970, and he chose to include the characters A, j, and *, his password might be ""JM*Sj23A"".


To add or change your password, go to “User Accounts” in the control panel.






On your account, click the “Create a password for your account”.






After setting your password it might prompt you to restrict your personal files to your user account, it would probably be wise to do so, and click “Create password” button.





;
, Set other user accounts to restricted so they cannot install programs or view other files without permission, or change important system settings. Do this to the accounts of anyone you believe does not know computers well or may cause harm to your system.

To restrict other user accounts, go to user accounts in the control panel.






On the user selected, change the account type to ""Administrator"".

, Disable scripts too (NoScript, Privoxy and Proxomitron can do this). Look at what independent computer security analysts (such as US-CERT) and crackers (similar to hackers) say. Google Chromeis more secure and has a sandbox featureso it would be more difficult to compromise the system and spread the infection.

, Hackers may use dictionary attacks and brute force attacks.

, When downloading software (including antivirus software), get it from a trusted source (softpedia, download, snapfiles, tucows, fileplanet, betanews, sourceforge) or your repository if you are using Linux.

, Antivirus software is designed to deal with modern malware including viruses, trojans, keyloggers, rootkits, and worms. Find out if your antivirus offers real-time scanning, on-access or on-demand. Also find out if it is heuristic. Avastand AVGare very good free editions. Choose one, download and install it and scan regularly. Keep your virus definitions up to date by updating regularly.

, I can't state this enough - you need to run a good anti spyware and anti malware program like Spybot if you search the web at all. Many websites out there exploit weaknesses and holes in the security of Microsoft Explorer and will place malicious code on your computer without you knowing about it until its too late!

, Either ZoneAlarmor Comodo Firewall(Kerio, WinRoute or Linux comes with iptables). If you use a router, this gives an added layer of security by acting as a hardware firewall.

, Hackers use port scanning (Ubuntu Linux has all ports closed by default).

, Start with ping, then run a simple nmap scan. Backtrack Linux will also be useful.

,, Consider something like a Kensington lock (in case of theft/unauthorised access). Also setting a BIOS password and preventing access to your machine or its removable devices (USB, CD drive etc.). Don't use an external hard drive or USB device for important data, these represent another vulnerability, as they are easier to steal/lose.


Encryption can be effective against theft. Encrypt at least your entire user account rather than just a few files. It can affect performance but can prove worth it. Truecrypt works on Windows, OS X, Linux, FreeOTFE works on Windows and Linux. In OS X (10.3 or later) System Preferences Security, click FileVault (this can take minutes to hours). In Linux Ubuntu (9.04 or later) installation Step 5 of 6 choose ""Require my password to login and decrypt my home folder"". This uses ""ecryptfs"".

Log in to Facebook.,
Never share your password.,
Never log into your Facebook account when out at a public place.,
Never allow a third party app to gain access to your personal information, especially if it's not trustworthy.,
Personalize your privacy settings.,
Download a copy of your Facebook data under 'Settings > General > Download a copy.',
If you are a celebrity and want a secured account, create a page on Facebook.,
Only add people you know in real life as Facebook friends.",How to Secure Your Facebook Account," Type in your username (or email ID) and your password. Never check the box ""Keep me logged in."" If you do so, it will increase the chances of people hacking into your accounts.


You can check the 'Keep me logged in' box on your own personal computer only (if no one else uses it).





;
, There have been times when Facebook users share their passwords with other Facebook users, which leads to account hacking. If you share your password with your friends, they might as well log into and mess with your account, which can land you in serious trouble, so you should avoid sharing your password.
, However, if you think your friends are trustworthy (or your cyber cafe is trustworthy) when at the place you're out at, you can log in at a public place. However, you could land in serious trouble if you don't.

When you open up your account in a friend's computer or from cyber cafe, never click on 'Keep me logged in' as well. This applies to every other account you have on the Internet including your Gmail and Spotify accounts.






Your friends may have installed the Facebook Password Decryptor software, which stores all your Facebook login information. So, you should be aware of this software because your friend (or the cyber cafe) is not going to tell you that he or she has installed this software.






Always have a very strong password that no one can guess. The password can be very long.






Just a long password can't make your account secure either. Hackers use a technique called 'dictionary attack' where they use each and every word of the English alphabet in the password box to open up your account. You are always welcomed to use numbers, lower and uppercase characters, symbols (!@#$%^&) to make your password invulnerable to such types of attacks.






Use a password strength software from websites like www.passwordmeter.com/ to check how strong your password is.‎






Be sure to change your Facebook password once every 2-3 months. If someone knows your password, he/she can't access your account after some time.
These are the common mistakes which people often make. Never use passwords similar to your Facebook password. These passwords include: password, password123, <your name>, <your boyfriend's/ girlfriend's name>, and <your pet name>. If your friends try to access your Facebook account, they'll try these passwords at first.
Never use the same passwords on multiple sites. For example, use three different passwords for your Facebook, Twitter and Google accounts. The reason for keeping multiple passwords on multiple sites is because, for if someone has hacked one of your accounts, he/she can hack another account using the same password.







, These apps will have rights to post anything on your behalf, which can make it dangerous if you want a secured Facebook account. Always use third party apps that are good and have a very good reputation on Facebook.

, This step is the major factor to securing your Facebook account.


Go to Settings > Security. On the top you'll see an option called 'Secure browsing'. You need to edit this option and check the box 'Browse Facebook on a secure connection (https) when possible.' This will also make your Facebook account secure.






Go to Settings > Security. On the second option you'll see 'Login Notifications.' Edit this option and check the boxes for both of the options that are available there. The feature of this, is that whenever you login from someone's computer, you'll receive a message that someone has accessed your Facebook account. If you know that it's you, it's OK, but, if you get a message that someone has accessed your account, you know that someone has accessed your account. This feature even shows the browser name, computer operating system and the time to make your investigation more easier.






Go to the third option in Settings > Security. It should say 'Login approvals'. Just click on ""Edit"" and check the 'Require a security code to access my account from unknown browsers' box. A pop up box that reads 'Login Approvals is an extra layer of security that uses your phone to protect your account' will appear. Click on 'Get Started.' The good thing about this feature is that Facebook will send you a text message on your mobile phone whenever a login is attempted from an unknown browser.






Go to the option called 'Trusted contacts' in Settings > Security. This feature allows your trusted contacts on Facebook to help you to get back on the site if your Facebook account is hacked or you've forgotten your password somehow. Add a few trusted contacts (you need to add at least 3 people) and you're done.





Go to Settings > Privacy. You'll see an option that reads 'Who can see my stuffs'. Just edit this option and change the option 'Friends of friends' to 'Friends (only).' If you let friends of friends see your stuffs, people who are even your friends of friends can see them. One of the 'friends of friends' can also be a hacker who wants to hack your account.





When posting or sharing a photo/video or anything else, you can also click on the option called 'Friends,' which means the things that you share will only be visible to your friends.






On the Settings page, click on 'Timeline and tagging' and change the option from 'Friends of friends' to 'Friends (only).' However, if you want friends of friends to see your timeline too, you can choose that option, but doing this will make your account less secure.


, If you've been on Facebook for many years and have so much data on it, but, if a hacker deletes your account on Facebook, you'll be in trouble. So, if you want your memories not to be forgotten, just download this a copy of your data. Be sure to download your data once every three months.

, This is much better for celebrities who get tons of fan mail or even threatening messages.

, Don't add everyone you see on the 'People you may know' section. There's a trend among teenage people, which is to make many friends on Facebook as if playing in the Olympics. However, you should not be part of this trend, because people who you have added as friends may also turn out to be hackers who just want a free lunch.


Regularly check your friends list on Facebook. Some hacker may have created a fake profile on your friend's name and may have reverted back to his or her name after you've confirmed that the hacker did that. Letting a hacker becoming your friend is like giving him or her access to your contact as well as personal information. Avoid this by only adding people you know in real life as Facebook friends.

Ensure you know and trust the sender before opening an email.,
Check the subject line for common spam topics.,
Avoid any ""calls to action"" or requests for personal information.,
Hover over any links in the email to see if they match their supposed destination.,
Look for typos, especially of key phrases or words.,
Never open or download attachments unless you know what they are.,
Type in any links directly instead of clicking on the links.,
Use 3rd-party security sites to test emails and links you're still worried about.,
See if the message was diverted to the spam folder.",How to Recognize Spam1," Since you can see who the sender is from your inbox list without having to open the message, you can deduce if a message is spam by simply looking at the sender’s email address. That said, some spam and phishing scams will pretend to be major companies, so you can't assume that an email from ""Amazon"" is guaranteed to be non-spam.


If the message was sent from a website that you don’t recognize or an email address from someone you don’t know, chances are the message is spam.
In rare cases, spammers control other people's accounts, meaning you may get emails from your ""friends"" who have been hacked. Checking the sender is the first, not the only, step you should take.
If the sender's address has a bunch of numbers or a domain you don't recognize (the part after the ""@"") then the email is likely spam.;
, You likely already know most of these -- sales, investment opportunities, new treatments, requests for money, sex, information on packages you never ordered, etc. Usually, you are being offered something, often for nothing. If you didn't order it, don't assume you forgot. This is simply a scam tactic to make you click a bad link.


If you want even more specifics, the US FTC has a list of the 12 most common spam email types on their website., This is known as phishing, when a criminal pretends to be a reputable site, like PayPal, that has to ""update user information,"" or needs you to sign in ""immediately."" In general, if the email asks for immediate action or personal information, it is phishing and should be ignored.One of the most common subject lines, ""Problem with your Account"" is almost always phishing. If you had a problem, it will tell you when you log on to the account.

, For example, hover your mouse over the following link for www.google.com. Don't click -- instead, look to the bottom-left corner of your screen, where a different URL (one for Wikihow) shows up instead of Google. Spammers do this trick all the time to bring you to dangerous sites.


Be especially wary if the address is a set of numbers -- most reputable companies will use words instead of numerals., Spam can come from all over the world and can be written in various writing forms to pique your interest. Find any misspelled words One of the ways spam can get past a filter is by rearranging letters of words that spam filters look out for.


For example, spam might spell the word “sexual” as “sxeual"" to avoid being picked up.
You might see this in URLs as well, like sending you to ""Paypal"" instead of PayPal, or www.ebay.random.words.and.numbers.10002122.com.Spam normally contains extensive, large images that occupy most of the message body. The text is usually large to capture your attention.

, If you don't know the sender, can't trust a link, or otherwise feel like an email may be spam, do not open any attachments. This is the quickest way to a virus, bar none. If you must open the attachments, right click on them first, then select ""scan for viruses"" or ""scan"" before opening.


Gmail automatically checks attachments for viruses, but it isn't perfect., The most common way you're information is compromised is by clicking a link in the spam email. However, if you're unsure if the email is legitimate or spam, you still have options. For example, if you get a packaging email you weren't expecting from Amazon, log on to Amazon and type in the order number to check it -- don't click on the ""track package"" link in the email., If you're still on the fence, there are some sites that let you check links before you've clicked on them. You can try getlinkinfo.com to see if there are a lot of ""redirects,"" which likely means there is spam coming from the site. You can also use the program SiteCheck, which takes any URL and checks if there are malware or viruses on the page., Most email services have an anti-spam feature that filters suspicious messages and diverts them to a specific folder in your email account labeled “Spam.” If the mail server detects a message to be spam, it separates it from your other messages into the Spam folder, away from your inbox. This is the first and most obvious sign of a spam email.

"
"
Never provide personal information, including a username or password, in reply to an email or email link.,
Immediately run anti-virus software if you're worried you opened up spam email.,
Change any identical passwords if you think you've fallen for spam or phishing.,
Forward the email to your IT or tech department if it is at all involved with your work or work email.,
Delete the email once you've informed IT or neutralized the threat.",How to Recognize Spam2," If Amazon emails you asking to log on and check something, go to Amazon on your own and log on. Phishing is a scam where someone creates a fake site that looks exactly like a real one, then collects emails and passwords from people that they test on other sites (like you bank). If asked for personal information, always refuse., If you're worried, get some free antivirus software to ensure that your computer is safe. Sophos is a great for Macs, and AVG is good for PCs, and both have free options. SpyBot Pro is also a good way to get rid of malware, and is also free.


Check your computer again 1-2 weeks later to ensure you have no problems.

, If you gave your password out for Facebook, and your Twitter account uses the same password, change them both. It is better to be safe than sorry, so run through every possible site that could share a password with the one you gave out.If you're worried about bank information, call your bank and set up an alert. Or monitor your accounts for the next 2-3 weeks, immediately canceling them if weird charges come up.

, If you've found a phishing scheme or dangerous spam, let your IT department know. They can search for or neutralize the threat, as well as warn the rest of the company to be on the lookout for specific scams., It can also help to ""archive"" it, an option with almost all email services. This tucks it away but doesn't delete it, which can help IT or other services fix your computer if the email turns out to contain malware. Even then, when in doubt you should just delete the email -- better safe than sorry.Delete any and all attachments that you may have downloaded with the email.

Keep your email address as private as possible.,
Keep your usernames different from your email addresses.,
Never check the ""Yes, I want to receive more information..."" box when signing up for sites or deals.,
Create multiple accounts, or change your email regularly.",How to Recognize Spam3," Don't give your email out unless you trust the source. While some spam is unfortunately inevitable these days, you can minimize most of it by just keeping your email address private., For example, say that your Tumblr handle is WikiHow15. If your email address is wikihow15@gmail.com, you've basically given the whole world your address. Most spammers actually ""test"" thousands of guessed emails until they find those that work -- so having differentiated emails and usernames can help keep them at bay., This signs your address up for regular, robotically sent emails, notifications, and spam. Unless you really love the site or band, avoid this box at all costs.


Check to see if this box is pre-checked for you -- many sites make you opt-out of spam instead of in.

, One of the best ways to avoid spam is to concentrate it in one account. For example, you might set up an account just to buy things online, and another for personal business. You use the first email whenever you're purchasing or giving out bank information, then keep your personal emails in a more private account. You can give away one account at will, because you only really need it for specific functions."

Learn common traits of predators.,
Understand grooming.,
Be wary of requests to meet.,
Watch out for flattery.,
Identify suspicious behavior.,
Look for changes in your child's behavior.",How to Recognize an Online Predator1," Many online predators are looking to sexually exploit children or teens. They may be pedophiles or child molesters. There are many characteristics that are typical of predators. Generally, pedophiles are outgoing and engaging. If you meet someone online who seems overly friendly, be cautious.
Child molesters actively target their prey. They might use the internet to seek out a child they know from the neighborhood, work, or school.
Be aware that online predators can be complete strangers or someone you actually know.;
, ""Grooming"" is the process that the predator uses to gain a child's trust. Grooming can happen over a relatively short period of time, such as one conversation. It can also occur over a longer stretch, like a couple of weeks or even months.A predator is typically an adult. During the initial interactions, they might lie about their age in order to gain trust.
During the grooming process, the predator will try to establish a connection with the young person. For example, they might try to figure out which activities their prey enjoys and talk about them.
If a predator learns that you play soccer, for instance, they might say, ""Where do you play? I play every weekend. Which team are you on?""

, When you are unsure who you are dealing with online, there are several specific things to look out for. Being aware of warning signs can help keep you and your family safe. After the initial grooming period, many online predators will ask for an in person meeting. This is a red flag.If someone says, ""I really need to meet you in person"", be aware that could be a sign of a predator.
Be especially cautious if there are repeated requests. If someone tries to insist on meeting you, you need to question their motives.
Try saying, ""I enjoy chatting online about school, but it's making me uncomfortable that you are pressuring me to meet. Would you mind cooling it?""

, Online predators often try to emotionally manipulate their prey. They may offer compliments as a way to gain favor. Be wary of effusive flattery.If you have pictures of yourself online, a predator might comment on your appearance. Make sure that only friends can view your photos.
Consider it a warning sign if someone says something like, ""You're so pretty. I can get you a modeling contract.""

, Any statement that can be perceived as a threat is another warning sign. An online predator might try to scare a person into doing what they want. If someone threatens you, exit the site or chat room immediately.A threat could be something like, ""Don't tell your parents you've been talking to me. I'll find out.""
A predator could also threaten you by saying, ""If you don't meet me, I'll tell your friends your secrets.""
A request for personal information is also suspicious. Do not give out your phone number or address.

, Maybe you are concerned that your child is being targeted by an online predator. There are several warning signs you can look for. Think about whether your child:Is secretive about online activities
Seems obsessed with being online
Tries to hide the screen from view when an adult enters the room
Receives calls or texts from someone you don't know
Downloads pornography

Contact the CyberTipline.,
Check the sex offender registry.,
Contact the authorities.",How to Recognize an Online Predator2," If you are worried that your child is interacting with a predator, your first step is to talk to your child. Make it clear that you are worried, not angry. Ask your child questions to determine what is going on.For example, you could say, ""Being online seems like it is really controlling your mood lately. Is there some reason for that?""
You could also say, ""I'm concerned about your safety. Let's go over the ground rules for staying safe online again.""
Remind your child that they can trust you. Explain that you are just looking out for their best interests.
Make sure your child knows the warning signs of a predator. They also need to know never to share personal information.

, If you suspect that an online predator is targeting someone in your home, you can check your computer. Make sure that you have security software installed. This can help protect your computer from spyware and viruses.Run a security scan to see if any programs have been added to your computer without your knowledge.
Check for suspicious downloads. Look to see if there is any concerning new material on your computer, such as pornography.
Make sure to regularly inspect all of the computers in your house. Don't forget laptops and tablets.

, This resource is mandated by Congress. You can contact the tipline 24/7 to report suspected incidents of abuse. You can report inappropriate sexual advances and any distribution of unsolicited sexual material.Go to the website at www.cybertipline.com
You can also call 1-800-843-5678

, Many online predators have been convicted of a sexual offense. The sex offender registry is public information. Check your area to see if a potential sexual predator lives in your community.Family Watchdog is a site that allows parents to check their area for registered sex offenders. Enter your address to determine if anyone in your area is registered.
You should also check the address for your child's school, and other frequently visited areas.

, If you or someone you know is concerned that you are being targeted by an online predator, you should report it. Contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to make a report. You can reach that agency at 1800TheMissing.You can also contact the FBI to make a report.
If you are concerned about immediate danger, contact your local police department. Ask for an officer to come to your home to take a report.

Set boundaries.,
Purchase safety software.,
Guard your privacy.,
Avoid chat rooms.,
Listen to your instincts.",How to Recognize an Online Predator3," If you have a child or teen who is regularly online, you want to make sure that they follow basic safety guidelines. Set clear rules for your child's online activities. Then, clearly communicate these boundaries to your teen.Make a ""no delete"" rule. Tell your child not to clear their search history or cache. From time to time, check to see what they've been looking at.
Set a time limit. For example, allow your child to be online in the evening, but make sure they disconnect by 9 p.m.
Be aware of who their ""friends"" are. Make sure your teen can clearly explain who they are interacting with.

, Sometimes boundaries aren't enough. You can use technology to help keep your family members safe. Consider purchasing security software to install on all family computers.These programs can send alerts when someone tries to access questionable sites.
Safety software can also record all online activity, so you can tell with certainty which sites your child has visited.
Some programs can also prevent new windows from opening. This can help keep you and your family from accidentally stumbling into dangerous territory.

, Make certain that everyone in your household knows how to protect personal information. Hold a family meeting and talk about specific information that should never be shared online. Caution family members against sharing:Your home address
Phone numbers
Personal e-mail addresses
Locations of schools
Any details about physical appearance

, One of the best ways to stay safe is to avoid going into a private chat room. If someone asks you (or your child) to leave the group chat, consider this a warning sign. Inappropriate comments are most often made in private rooms.Leave a chat immediately if you feel uncomfortable. Teach your family members to do the same.
If asked to go in a private chat room, you can say, ""No, thanks. I'm cool hanging here with the group.""

, Go with your gut. If something feels ""off"", you need to do something or say something. If your instincts tell you that you are dealing with a predator, cut off contact immediately. Tell your parents or a friend about your suspicions.


This is good advice for parents, too. If your instincts tell you that your child is dealing with a predator, don't ignore the feeling.
Talk to your child immediately, and investigate your suspicions.

See if they remember you.,
Watch the suspected imposter.,
Listen or watch what the person 'says/does'.",How to Recognize an Online Celebrity Imposter," If the Official Website states that the only place to interact with them is on the Official Website, then anywhere else you are dealing with an Imposter.;
,


If you met the Celebrity in person, then check if they can remember you, if they can't, then the person is likely an imposter.
Celebrities also meet lots of fans. If you just sent fan mail once and check back a month later and they still ""remember you"", it's likely an imposter. Also, if you see only nice comments, they likely are an imposter deleting all rude/mean/""gotcha"" comments that reveal who they really are: NOT the celebrity at all, and likely they don't have any sort of connection(s) with the celeb.

,


If the supposed imposter tries to convince everyone that they are the celebrity, then that person is an imposter.

Invest on a firewall.,
Protect your codes.,
Use an SSL.,
Limit uploads.,
Use passwords.",How to Protect Your Server from Hackers1," After establishing your server, the next immediate thing you need to do is to put up a firewall. Firewalls are programs the filter out the information that goes in and out of your computer.


There are a lot of firewall applications available on the Internet and from local computer stores, but even the less experienced hackers can get past these. Invest on a well-developed and reputable application to ensure utmost security.
Firewalls are installed just like any other programs and are more than capable of protecting small scale servers. But if you’re running several mainframes, enterprise firewalls need to be installed by a software security specialist.;
, When creating your program codes for applications that your intended end users interacts with, make sure that appropriate error trappings are placed within the application. Hackers typically use SQL injections, or the manipulation of an application’s code through its URL or SQL forms.


When your program lacks error trappings that can cover loopholes where SQL queries can be injected, your server becomes a sitting duck to hackers.

, SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an Internet security protocol that protects your server by making sure that all information that goes in and out of the system remains private and inaccessible to third-party users.


Hackers can easily get the information from your server if it does not ask an SSL certificate. You can take advantage of this technology for your server by visiting the SSL website (http://info.ssl.com/) and availing its service.

, Your server will need to accept data from end users in order for it to gather information. Though uploads are necessary, you still need to limit the amount of information going in to the system.


To do this, format forms properly to make sure that only the required data gets into the system.

, Passwords are the most basic tool you can use and your first line of defense in protecting your server from hackers. Using passwords restricts any unauthorized access to your system; those without extensive technical know-how will find it hard to get into your system.


Make sure that the password you make are complex and very hard to crack. Using combinations of special characters, mixed cases and numbers will make it harder to break.

"
"
Keep your server’s location secret.,
Limit access.,
Avoid giving out any digital information about your server.,
Hire a professional.",How to Protect Your Server from Hackers2," If you can, avoid divulging the physical location of your server. Hackers that cannot get through to your digital security will most likely resolve to direct physical access to your mainframe.

, If you can’t keep your server’s location confidential, especially for offices and business where the addresses are intentionally given out to people, make sure that only authorized personnel have access to the server room.


Lock your server in a closed, cool, and suitable room, and provide security keys only to those that need to have access.

, Hackers can easily break into your system servers just by knowing its IP addresses. Make sure that these kinds of digital information about your server remains confidential and on a need-to-know basis only.

, There are many IT professionals that specialize on network and Internet security. If you find that your technical knowledge is limited and if your budget permits, employ a security specialist to take care of protecting your server from hackers for you.

Salaries of these kinds of personnel range from a few thousands to even hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the skill level. Though it may sound costly, it will prove to be worth it, especially if you’re housing very valuable information on your servers.

Determine if the nature of the correspondence is suspicious.,
Review suspicious emails and text messages for spelling and punctuation errors.,
Call the organization directly to verify the inquiry.,
Examine the website links and logos in suspicious emails you receive.,
Examine the email address of the entity that sent you the email.,
Provide your personal information only to websites that are secure.,
Review your bank statements regularly.",How to Protect Yourself from Phishing Scams," The subject content of the email, phone call, or text message will often help you determine if the message is legitimate.


Phishing correspondences will usually ask you for sensitive, personal information that the organization should already have. For example, if your bank sends you an email asking you to provide them with your bank account and routing number, it may be a phishing scam.
In some cases, phishing correspondence may be written to induce panic or assume a threatening tone designed to make you act immediately and provide your personal information.;
, In most cases, phishing scams are not proofread before they are sent and contain multiple errors.


If the email or text message is coming from a major business or corporation, it is unlikely that spelling and punctuation errors will be published without review by an editor.

, This will allow you to determine if the correspondence you received is legitimate or a phishing scam.


Mention to the organization that you received suspicious correspondence and you need to clarify its authenticity. The organization may also take further action on their end if it is a phishing scam.
If you were left with a voice mail or automated message providing you with a phone number to call, verify that the phone number matches with the phone number in your records for that organization.

, In some cases, links and logos are masked to look legitimate but may take you to a different website or cause you to download malicious files.


Hover your cursor over the link or business logo within your email. A small pop-up bar that displays the true website address will appear below the link embedded within the email.
Refrain from clicking or visiting any unfamiliar links that end with an ""exe"" extension. ""Exe"" links may cause you to download malicious software, spyware, or other programs that can steal your personal information.

, Sometimes, phishing scams will display email addresses that resemble authentic company email addresses, but vary slightly enough to trick you. For example, if the email address for a business ends in ""company.com,"" a phishing scam may use a variation such as ""trusted.company.com"" to trick you.

, This may prevent any personal information you enter from being seen or stolen by malicious entities.


Look at the address bar of the website you are visiting to determine if the site begins with ""] rather than ""The ""] part of the web address indicates that the website is secure.
A yellow padlock icon displayed toward the bottom of your web session can also help you determine a website's security. Double-click on the padlock icon to verify that a security certificate displays on the screen, as some websites will display just a graphic of a padlock to be malicious.

, This will allow you to see if any unauthorized charges or purchases have been made with your account, indicating that you may be the victim of a phishing scam.


If you notice any unauthorized activity in your bank account or on credit cards, notify your local authorities and your financial organizations immediately. This may prevent the cybercriminals behind the phishing scam from continuing to use your information.

Place keywords with content.,
Use data-driven articles.,
Use storytelling.,
Arise curiosity.,
Deliver content.",How to Get Better Google Rankings1," The crucial way to better your Google ranking is to use informational keywords, which start with “where,” “how,” and “when,” and which are relatively different when compared to commercial and transactional. For example, instead of using “YouTube tutorial of a paper tree,” you can replace it with “How to make a paper tree by watching a tutorial on YouTube.” These keywords help improve the search rankings by providing detailed content when the users use the keyword in their Google search statements.;
, Back up your article with relevant data and data-driven facts. The more statistical and informative data you use, the better your Google rank will be. To emphasize the content, you can focus on the micro content, which is not revealed on all the other websites of your field.

, Stories can captivate your audience, evoke emotions, improve your conversion rate and add numbers to it. Instead of planting the data in a simplistic and plain form, you can modify it into a conventional storytelling-kind of article to create interest among the readers.

, An article with a curious headline is visually more tempting than the one without. A curious headline is the one that your target market might have a slight knowledge about and want to know more about it. The best example of this is the ad created in 1926 for selling pianos, which read, “They laughed when I sat down at the piano—but when I started to play!” It captured attention—what happened when he started to play? So make sure that your articles inspire curiosity among the audience.

, Aside from arising curiosity, make sure that you deliver the content based on the promise of your headline. Often, you find blogs with assuring headlines and zero content—don’t be one of them. This will most likely hurt your business rather than help.

Search for web pages.,
Check for the link-backs.,
Use Google Alerts.",How to Get Better Google Rankings2," While surfing on Google, you may come across web pages that mention your website and business in one way or another. Search for all those web pages, and make a list based on proximity and frequency, because the more times your website is mentioned, the more traffic you will relatively get, and if the website that mentioned yours is of the same genre, the audience will most likely become interested to visit your site. You can search the list of pages by merely typing the name of the website or business in the search bar of Google search engine in any web browser.

, After checking the search results, find where your website or business is mentioned and check whether these are linked back to your site. In most cases, the citations are not directed to your website, and hence can’t be counted as a vote.

, You can use Google Alerts to create an automated email notification that will notify you each time your business or website is mentioned in any other web pages. After getting the notification, you can always contact whoever mentioned your business in their website and ask them to provide a link back to your website.


You can create a Google Alert at its official website.

"Notice the classification of the votes.,Merge the classification.,
Redirect the second page to the first.",How to Get Better Google Rankings3," Most websites and businesses are executed with owners not knowing about the pooling of votes. For instance, “www.yourwebsite.com” and “http://yourwebsite.com” are not classified as a single page, but two different pages by all search engines. Therefore, the votes acquired by your site are shared between two different parties.


, After realising the classification of votes, let Google know about your problem. Tell Google that you want to merge the votes for the two pages as one and to be counted from www.yourwebsite.com towards http://yourwebsite.com. You can post the queries regarding this at Google Moderator as a start, and follow the instructions given by them.

, To redirect the second page to the first one, you can use the permanent (known as 301) redirect from the first page to the second.


Use the permanent 301 page, by creating a .htaccess file on your computer. Open the file to edit and place the following code in the file: “redirect 301 /secondpage/secondpage.htm http://www.firstpage.com/new.htm.” Update this to the root folder on your computer. This will redirect the second page to the first page.

This will not only enhance your promotion, but also create an interesting content for your site as people will be more interested to visit the page due to your participation and voting procedures, and viewers will most likely share the directories on their profiles.

, Once you receive these photos from the customers, upload them to your company’s Flickr or Pinterest account. As people love to win things, you can also arrange a voting system or poll, which can create a sheer interest among the audience and will also increase the shares and promotion of the content.

, After uploading and creating a voting system, enable Google reverse image search for people to find you through other websites that use your images. You can also ask them to link back the citations or credit you with the site’s link.

Offer guest posts.,
Volunteer services.",How to Get Better Google Rankings5," In the contemporary society we are living in, everyone looks up to you as a good deal when you have done something that is conventionally good. Offering discounts or donating to a specific club or organization will highly affect your promotion. For example, offering discounts for students allows you to receive excellent links from many websites as they usually work in different sectors.

, If you don’t have money to offer discounts or to donate to charity, you can always offer guest posts to other websites, asking them to link your website in return. Writing guest posts for sites that have huge traffic will also increase your traffic, thus increasing your Google rank.

, Instead of guest posts, you can also offer services that can promote the traffic of your website. Alternatively, you could have a staff team-building day on which you help a local charity. This will increase the tag value of the site and will also help improving your Google ranking.

Open social media pages.,
Get directory listings.,
List consistent information.",How to Get Better Google Rankings6," All the social networking sites, like Facebook, Google+, Twitter, to name a few, give you a platform to create business pages classified according to category. You can build a social page for your business in each social media site to gather more customers.

, A directory links your website to other websites for traffic and domain authority, and lists them accordingly based on their categories. It has become critical these days to get quality directories compared to when one used to build thousands of links without any effort. With its sharing and commenting features, social media can help enhance your website traffic effectively, as these prompt the audience to visit your site.

, After creating the page, list all the consistent information, like addresses and contact number, in the correct format using dashes and parenthesis. For example, “Our company was established in the year 1993 (November 30th).” Here the date and month are inscribed in parenthesis just to inform the user but is not included in the flow. This will build a profile for your business and increase the trust percentage on Google when searching for the particular date, leading to improving of ranking."

, Passwords are there to protect your account; without passwords we would be lost. Make sure your password is complicated; do not use your name, or last name. For example, do not put in ""John"" because the first thing that hackers will do is to guess your password based on your name. Don't use a phrase or use a pet name that most people know about. For example, do not put in ""MyPetMaddy"" or ""ShowUsYouFeelGood"". Try to use a complicated code like ""mkael092"" or use a code like this ""09484M92"", so it is impossible to guess. Choose a password you have not previously used on your account before. A good password will contain a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters; numbers; and/or special characters such as %, $, and +. It is very important to keep your password private at all times. A password that contains a mixture of letters and numbers is a good way of securing your password.

Chose a Firewall


Choosing the right Firewall is a very important step.,
If you do not want to use a free firewall and have some money you can go buy a full security suite, almost all security suites now have firewalls built into the suite.

,
After choosing a suite install it according to the creators instructions.,
After the firewall installs it will most likely require a reboot.,
Read any pop-ups that appear on the computer after the restart, accept all of them from programs you use and trust.

,
If you see any pop-ups appear and you don't know what they are for go to your favorite search engine and type in the name of the program.,Your computer should now be secure with the firewall, when it blocks any hacker attacks it will pop-up and alert you

",How to Protect Your Computer With a Firewall," You will need to decide if you want a simple and easy-to-use firewall, or a firewall that you can configure everything it does.

Check Point Software makes Zone Alarm a free firewall for home users. It is a very powerful firewall but it may not work on older hardware.






Comodo Firewall Pro is a free for home use firewall from the Comodo Group. With this firewall you can edit a lot of settings but is not best for people who want a simple to use firewall.






Tall Emu Pty Ltd is the creator of the Online Armor which offers a free firewall for home use. This Firewall can work on older hardware and is simple to use but does not offer auto updating in the free version.





;
,, These instructions can normally be found from the creators firewalls website.

, Reboot the computer and watch for any pop-ups from the firewall.

,, Look for a source that says what the program does and decide what action to take upon what the website says.

Do not share personal information on social networking sites.,
Avoid connecting your computer to any public Internet connection, especially when you’re doing any monetary transaction.,
Do not give away personal information to anyone on the Internet, and be aware of impostors.,
Be careful of phishing sites.,
Always scan your computer or personal devices for any possible malware infections.",How to Protect Personal Information1," This is one of the most common mistakes people make. Do not share every personal detail about you on these kinds of sites.


For example, when you get your first credit card, don’t get too excited and post a photo of your credit card on Facebook or Twitter. Once people get a hold of your valuable information through social networking sites, they are free to use it anyway they like.;
, Your personal computer holds very important and personal data about you. When you connect it to an unsecure public Internet connection, like a cafe Wi-Fi, people can easily hack into your computer and steal any information stored on it.

, There are times when you’ll get an e-mail from someone pretending to be someone you know, and then ask questions either about your bank information, addresses, or details about other people. When this happens, do not give out any information as these people are probably impersonators preying on unsuspecting people.

, Phishing sites copy other legitimate websites, such as banks, online shops, and more, and deliberately name their website addresses closely similar to the original site. When people make mistakes in typing the web addresses, they won’t notice the mistake and continue to enter their login information and other details , not knowing that they are on the wrong site and that they've just given away valuable personal and account information.

, Malicious programs such as spywares track everything you do on your computer, from websites you visit even up to keyboard buttons you press.

Deter content stealers by placing a copyright notice on your content.,
Create technical barriers to stealing your content.,
Monitor your online content.,
Send a take down notice.",How to Protect Online Content," Accompany any piece of work that is subject to copyright protection (most literary works including blog posts and articles, music, art, etc.) by a copyright notice. The goal with placing a copyright notice on your work is simply to deter would-be content stealers from taking your content. If someone sees that you have placed the copyright notice on your work, they may be less likely to take it because they fear they may be breaking the law. It is the easiest way to protect your content because it simply requires you to write 3 pieces of information on your work: The word copyright (or the symbol), your name, and the date you created the work. Using the notice does not give you superior rights in your work.;
, The reason online content stealing is so pervasive is because it is very easy to obtain a copy of someone else’s work and republish it. Your goal in creating technical barriers for reproducers is to make it more difficult for people to actually take your content.


It is important to note than while it is possible to make it difficult to steal content, there are often ways around these technical barriers, so the idea is not to make it impossible to steal, but rather to deter the stealing. An internet search can provide you with tools to protect images, videos and text on a website.

, An effective way of protecting your content is to check for instances of unauthorized use of your content on the internet. There are many online tools that can conduct a search of the web for your content for you.


One such tool is Copyscape, a website on which you input your URL and the program scours the internet to determine a page other than yours contains your content. Copyscape also provides a banner that you may insert on your site to deter people from stealing your content.
You can also perform a basic internet search by using several unique sentences of your work as the search term. This will show you results for websites that are using your exact wording and can alert you to possibly infringing sites.

, If, after you have taken steps to prevent the stealing of your online content, you find your work on another website, your next step should be to contact the author of that website and request that they take down your work.


It can be easy to identify the contact information for the website author in the form on a “contact” page or a link to an email address.
If you have the contact information, write a simple letter to the author identifying your work, stating that their use of your work is not permitted, and requesting that they take the work off their website.
If that fails, you may consider writing a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) take down request. Information on the DMCA request is linked below.

Do not store personal information on devices that can be stolen or lost.,
Encrypt your electronic devices.,
Take care of your media storage.,
Keep paper files and documents in a safe place.,
Dispose personal documents properly.",How to Protect Personal Information2," Most people save details like bank accounts, login information for different accounts, and even personal pictures on their mobile phones and laptops. When these devices are lost or stolen, all your personal information gets compromised.

, If you can’t avoid saving personal information on your gadgets, then you could at least try to encrypt your devices by adding security measures such as passwords. This way, in the event your device gets lost, it won’t be easy for anyone to just open it up and steal data.

, Secure media storages, such as DVD/CDs, flash drives, and external/internal hard disks, that you use to store your personal information. Put it in a secure location, away from places where people might pick it up.

, Even if it isn’t in digital form, paper documents can also be stolen without you knowing it. Cameras now have high resolutions that it can copy these documents in a flash. You can keep these documents inside personal vaults or have it stored inside a personal safety deposit box in banks.

, When you’re through with a particular document, such as expired IDs and forms, dispose of them properly to avoid other people reusing it.


You can burn these documents or use shredding machines.






For digital storages, make sure you wipe out its contents before you dispose it.

Keep your operating system (OS) up-to-date.,
Keep your programs up-to-date.,
Keep your antivirus up-to-date and running (under MS Windows).,
Use only one unique ACTIVE antivirus program.,
Never download anything except on official sites (any OS) or trusted repositories (Linux/BSD/MacOS).,
If you can, check binary signatures (see ] for example and the wiki article ).,
Use a firewall.,
If you firewall is stateless, use it for log purpose only.,
Check what services (also called daemons) are running: as I said, if there is no one on the platform to unload the train, NOTHING can happen.,
Don't use an admin account: it's better in Windows Vista and Seven, but if you are using an admin account, any software can ask for admin privileges, even malware you've launched recklessly.,
If you don't need to play games or to use some very rare niche software, switch to Linux.",How to Prevent People from Tracking You on the Internet1," The easiest way for malicious people to track and record everything about you is to have you install a spyware/virus or to automatically break into your computer. By keeping your OS up-to-date, your allow your OS provider to release security updates for critical parts of your system that could prevent automatic security breach exploitation and could turn some spyware into some useless pieces of code.;
, New versions of a program are made to enhance user experience, to add some features, that's true. But not only: this is also a way to correct bugs. There are different kinds of bugs: some of them will just produce visual artifacts, others will prevent you from doing something advertised, others can be remotely and automatically exploited by hacker to take over your computer. Without bugs, no remote attacks.

, If the signature database of the antivirus is not up-to-date, some viruses won't be found right away. If your antivirus is not running in the background and if your system is not checked on a regular basis, you'd better uninstall your antivirus software. It's worth noting that antivirus programs usually seek for viruses, spyware, rootkit and worms. The specific anti-spyware programs are not better, most of the time.

, An antivirus program needs to act very suspiciously to work well. In the best case scenario, you will get a false positive by one program or the other, in the worst-case scenario, the different anti-malware programs will prevent each other from working correctly. If you really want to use more than one antivirus, update signature database, unplug your computer from the internet, disable your main antivirus completely and run the second one in a ""on-demand"" mode. Then, you may have a false positive (your main antivirus) : it's ok. Launch your main antivirus and you can use your computer as usual. Malwarebytes is a good addition to your first layer of AV defense.

, For instance, if you want to download the VLC media player, download it from its official site (search google for it and you find : www.videolan.org/vlc/). Do never ever use links in any random non-official websites, even if your antivirus is not screaming when you do so.

, Basically, the idea here is to create a signature from a file (e.g. a program installer). This signature is given on the official website or in a trusted database. When you download the file, you can produce this signature yourself from the file with a special program. Then, you can compare this signature with the one on the website : if they are identical, you are sure you have the good installer. If not, you most probably downloaded a fake installer containing a virus or your download did not succeed (either ways, you have to download the file again to make sure). This process is done automatically in most Linux distro and in *BSD using any package manager without doing anything special. Under Windows, you have to manually check.

, Under Linux/*BSD, there are two wonderful firewalls integrated (netfilter/iptables and pf respectively). Under MS Windows, you have to find a good one. One thing you have to understand is that a firewall is like a switchman in a middle of a huge train station with trains (network data), platforms (ports) and railways (streams). A train by itself can't unload what it is carrying : he'll need someone to do that (a service or daemon : a program that runs in background that is listening to a particular port). Without that someone, that service, even if the train can reach the platform, it can do absolutely nothing. Let me remind you: a firewall is not a wall or a gate, it's a switchman (you can do much more with a firewall than allowing or preventing data from crossing)! That said, keep in mind that you can't control outgoing connections (except if you block everything or unplug the cable) but you can log what is going out... Most spyware find clever ways to go through your firewall but they can't hide what they are doing and it's much easier to find a spyware sending stuff to a remote server on port 993 in spite of you're not using IMAP programs that finding it, hiding in the Internet Explorer process and sending data in port 443 that you are using every day. If you have access to a standard firewall (netfilter/iptables and PF are), just log unexpected outgoing data and block anything ingoing except established and related connections. Don't forget to allow everything on the loopback device (lo) : this is safe and required.

, You can't smartly block ingoing stuff. Avoid per-application filtering: it is bothersome, useless and gives a false feeling of security. Most of today's spyware append their malicious code to a trusted application that is expected to access the internet (usually Internet Explorer): it is launched with Internet Explorer. When Internet Explorer tries to connect to the internet, your firewall ask you if you want it to do so, you answer ""yes"" and then the spyware can send anything through ports 80 and 443, in the middle of your own genuine data.

, You are not a server: you don't need services to be up and listening to the outside (be careful : most of Windows/Linux/MacOS/BSD services ARE needed and are not listening to the outside! If you can, disable useless services or block any traffic on the corresponding ports with your firewall (for example, if the NetBios daemon is listening to the ports 135 and 138, you can block any ingoing and outgoing traffic on these ports if you don't use Windows shares. Please remember: bugs in services are the open doors to remotely take over you computer, if there are no services or if those are blocked by a firewall, no one can remotely break into your computer. You can also try port scanning programs such as nmap to determine which ports you have to block or which services you have to disable (it gives the same results).

, If you are not admin, the spyware must be much smarter to be used at full potential. At most, if you are a standard user, the spyware can send information about you, but not the other users. It cannot use a lot of useful part of the system to help it sending data and it's much more easier to remove it from your computer.

, Until today on, there is only a dozen of known malware programs running under Linux. Those programs were disabled a long time ago thanks to security updates. Binaries are taken from verified, signed, authenticated repositories. You don't need any antivirus and there are plenty of free, open source, great quality programs to do almost everything (firefox, chrome, inkscape, gimp, pidgin, openoffice, FileZilla, ffmpeg (used in almost every audio/video converter for windows out there), ghostscript (used in almost every pdf converter out there), xchat, and much much more were firstly developed by and for Linux and then ported to Windows because they were great).

Create complex passwords.,
Use a password manager.,
Don't give out your password.,
Change your passwords often.,
Use two-factor authentication.,
Read privacy polices carefully.,
Log out of accounts when you're done with them.,
Make sure you're on an official website when entering passwords.",How to Prevent Hacking1," Your passwords to access your accounts on apps or websites should consist of a combination of numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters that is difficult to guess.

Don't use the same password for more than one website or account. This limits the damage to you if a hacker happens to crack one of your passwords.;
, Password managers store and auto-fill your credentials for different sites, allowing you to create a complex and unique password for each site without having to worry about entering the password itself more than once. While you should absolutely keep track of you passwords on your own as well, a password manager will help make your device much more secure.

Highly praised third-party password managers include ""Dashlane 4"", ""LastPass 4.0 Premium"", ""Sticky Password Premium"", and ""LogMeOnce Ultimate"".
Most browsers have a built-in password manager that stores and encrypts your passwords.

, This is an obvious piece of advice, but one that bears revisiting: with the exception of some school services, you shouldn't ever have to provide a site administrator with your password for them to access your account.This logic applies to IT workers and Microsoft or Apple representatives.
Similarly, don't tell people your phone or tablet's PIN or passcode combination. Even your friends might accidentally tell someone your passcode.
If you do have to give someone your password for some reason, change it as soon as they are done with whatever they needed to do on your account.

, In addition to keeping your password a secret, you should change the passwords on your various accounts and devices at least once every six months.


Be sure not to use the same password twice (e.g., your Facebook password should be different than your bank password, etc.).
When you do change your password, you should change it substantially. Don't simply replace one letter with a number.

, Two-factor identification requires you to enter a code sent to you in a text message or another service to access your account after you enter your user name and password. This makes it more difficult for a hacker to access your information, even if they are able to crack your password.

Most major websites, including popular social media networks, have some form of two-factor authentication available. Check your account settings to learn how to enable this feature.
You can set up two-step verification for your Google account.
Popular app alternatives to receiving a text message include Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator.

, Any company that has information from you must have a privacy policy that details how they use that information and the extent to which they share it with others.Most people simply click through the privacy policy without reading it. Although the reading can be cumbersome, it's worth at least skimming it so you know how your data is being used.
If you see something in the privacy policy that you disagree with, or that makes you uncomfortable, you may want to reconsider sharing information with that company.

, Simply closing the browser window isn't always enough, so make sure you click (or tap) on your account name and select Log Out (or Sign Out in some cases) to manually sign out of your account and remove your login credentials from the site.

, Phishing scams – instances in which a malicious page pretends to be a login page for a social media or bank account – are one of the easiest ways for you to get hacked. One way to spot phishing scams is to look at the site's URL: if it closely resembles (but doesn't exactly match) a reputable site's URL (e.g., ""Faecbook"" instead of ""Facebook""), it's a fake site. For example, enter your Twitter login information on Twitter's official page only. Avoid doing so on a page that asks for the login information in order to share an article or something similar.
An exception to this rule is when a university uses an existing service (e.g., Gmail) through their home page.

Write a letter requesting that errors be removed.,
Report errors online, if you want.,
Wait to hear back.,
Add a statement of dispute to your report.",How to Protect Your Identity After an Online Data Breach1," You are entitled to one free credit report from each of the national Credit Reporting Agencies (CRAs) each year. You can also get free credit reports if you have been the victim of identity theft. You can request your free credit reports in one of three ways:Visit www.annualcreditreport.com and request your free report.
Call 1-877-322-8228 and request your report.
Send a request to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. You can use the Federal Trade Commission’s Credit Report Request Form, if you want.;
, Once you receive your report from each CRA, you should go over all of them. Highlight whatever information on the credit report looks wrong. You can have this information removed. Look for the following:accounts you didn’t open
whether the account balances are correct
any outstanding balances you can’t explain
wrong personal information, such as address, employers, Social Security Number, etc.

, In your letter, you should tell the CRA what information is inaccurate and request that it be removed. If you have documentary supporting evidence, then provide copies of that information as well.


You can use the FTC’s sample dispute letter, which is available at their website.Be sure to send the letter certified mail, return receipt requested. Also keep a copy of the letter. Staple the return receipt to your copy., Each CRA would prefer that you report errors using their online reporting system. However, you won’t have a paper trail if you report online. You need a paper trail in case the CRA claims you didn’t notify it of the credit report error. For this reason, you should probably report by sending a letter. Nevertheless, you can also report online. If you do, write down the day and time that you reported the error online.


To report errors to Equifax, visit their website and then select “Personal Solutions” at the top of the page. Hover over “Credit Report Assistance” and then click on “Dispute info on credit report.”For Experian, you can visit their website and then click on “Credit Report Assistance” at the top of the page. Select “Disputes” from the drop-down menu.To report errors to TransUnion, you should visit their website. Click on “Credit Report Assistance” at the top of the page. Then click on “Credit Report Disputes.”, After receiving your dispute, the CRA will contact the entity that provided the credit information. The CRA will ask the entity to confirm that the information is accurate. If the entity can’t confirm its accuracy, the CRA will remove the information from your credit report.


The CRA generally has 30 days to investigate your dispute and then respond. You should receive the resolution of the investigation in writing., You might be unhappy with the resolution. For example, a credit card company might insist that you (and not an identity thief) opened up a line of credit. In this situation, you can add a statement to your report. The statement will be sent with all future copies of your credit report, as well as to people who recently requested a copy.In your statement, you can explain that you were the victim of identity theft. For example, you can state, “My data was breached as part of the giant data breach involving Company X. Two weeks later a credit card was opened in my name by an identity thief. The thief then maxed out the card.”

Change your phone's passcode often.,
Use Touch ID if possible.,
Browse using secure web apps.,
Update your devices and software on time.,
Charge your phone on reliable USB ports.,
Avoid jailbreaking (or rooting) your phone or side-loading apps.",How to Prevent Hacking2," The first line of defense against people attempting to view or steal your data is a strong and constantly changing passcode.

Make sure that you substantially change the passcode each time you change it--don't just change one number.
On most phones, you can set a ""complex"" or ""advanced"" password that includes letters and symbols in addition to the typical numerical characters.

, While you'll still need to have your passcode for your phone's lock screen, you should use Touch ID on any supported devices to pay for items and any other available services.

As a general rule, cutting down on the amount of times you have to enter your password on any platform is a good practice.

, It may be tempting to use third-party browsers like Tor or Dolphin, but synchronizing your Google Chrome account or Safari account between your phone and your computer will both prevent the need to re-enter saved passwords and protect your device from unsafe websites., As soon as an update becomes available for anything from your phone's Facebook app to its entire operating system, you should apply it if possible.


Many updates are patches to repair weaknesses and address security vulnerabilities. Failing to update your software will eventually result in an exploitable weakness appearing, which puts your device at risk.
If you have the option to download all updates automatically, make use of this feature. It will save you a lot of trouble.

, These include the ports on your computer and in your car (if applicable). Public USB ports, like the ones you may see in a coffee shop, can compromise your information.


For this reason, it's a good idea to bring an electrical outlet connector in addition to your USB cable if you're traveling.

, Both iPhones and Androids have security safeguards that can be bypassed by jailbreaking or rooting the respective devices, but doing so opens your phone up to attacks and infections that would have previously been impossible. Similarly, downloading apps from unverified sources (""side-loading"" apps) greatly increases your risk of contracting malware.

Android phones have a built-in security suite that prevents you from downloading apps from unknown sources. If you do choose to disable this option (from the Security tab in Settings), you'll need to carefully verify websites from which you download apps before proceeding with the downloads.

"
"
Encrypt your hard drive.,
Install updates as soon as they become available.,
Back up your data frequently.,
Avoid clicking suspicious links or responding to unknown emails.,
Install or activate your firewall.,
Enable a firmware password.,
Disable remote access.,
Install antivirus software on your computer.",How to Prevent Hacking3," If your hard drive is encrypted, a hacker will be unable to read the data stored there, even if they manage to gain access to your hard drive. While you've taken steps to prevent access, encryption is another method of protecting your information.


Mac - FileVault is the encryption service for Macs. You can enable it by clicking the Apple icon in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen, clicking System Preferences, clicking the Security & Privacy icon, clicking the FileVault tab, and clicking Turn On FileVault. You may first have to click the lock icon and enter your Mac's administrator account password.Windows - BitLocker is Windows' default encryption service. To enable it, simply type ""bitlocker"" into the Start search bar, click the ""Bitlocker Drive Encryption"" option, and click Turn on BitLocker. Keep in mind that Windows 10 Home users won't have access to BitLocker without first upgrading to Windows 10 Pro.

, In addition to performance upgrades, system updates often contain improvements to security., Despite even the strictest security, it's still possible that your data may become compromised. This may be the result of hacking, or simply computer failure. Backing up your data ensures you don't lose anything.

There are cloud-based services you can use to back up your data. Check the security of these services carefully before joining one. While you may be tempted to go with the least expensive service, you want to make sure your data will be kept safe.
You also can use an encrypted external hard drive to back up your data. Set up your computer to run automatic backups daily, at a time of day when you aren't normally on your computer.

, If you get an unsolicited email, or an email from a sender that you cannot verify, treat it as a hacking attempt. Do not click on any links or give the sender any personal information.

Keep in mind that even replying to the email will let the sender know that your email address is active and valid. While you may be tempted to send them a sarcastic reply, even this will give them information they can use to hack you.

, Both Windows- and Mac-based computers come equipped with a firewall, which prevents hackers from gaining access to your computer. However, in most computers, the firewall is not turned on by default.

Go into the security settings of your computer and look for ""firewall"" settings. Once there, make sure it is turned on and that it is blocking incoming connections.
If you have a wireless network, your router should have a firewall as well.

, If your computer has the option available, require users to enter a password before rebooting from a disk or entering single-user mode. A hacker cannot get around a firmware password unless they have physical access to your machine, though you'll need to be extremely careful not to forget or lose the password since it is immensely difficult to reset. To create a firmware password:


Mac - Restart your Mac, then hold down ⌘ Command and R as it boots up. Click Utilities, click Firmware Password Utility, click Turn On Firmware Password, and create your password.

Windows - Restart your computer, then hold down the BIOS key (typically Esc, F1, F2, F8, F10, or Del) as your computer boots up. Use the arrow keys to select the password option, then enter your preferred password.

, You may need to access your computer remotely, or allow someone else to do so, such as if you've called tech support. However, you should keep it disabled by default and only turn it on for brief periods when you need it.

If you have remote access enabled, you essentially leave an open door for hackers to get into your computer and steal your data.

, Antivirus software recognizes and removes potentially harmful files and programs as soon as you download them. Windows Defender is a good choice for PCs, and it comes pre-installed on Windows 10 computers. For a Mac, consider AVG or McAfee as another line of defense on top of Gatekeeper, which is the default protection suite.It's also a good idea to make sure your computer's firewall program and Bluetooth function are only letting trusted connections access your computer.

Use secured wireless networks.,
Download programs only from reputable sites.,
Learn to recognize fake websites.,
Avoid file sharing services.,
Shop only on secure sites.,
Keep personal information off social media.",How to Prevent Hacking4," Generally speaking, secured networks require you to enter a password before you can connect to them. In some locations (such as airports or coffee shops), you can request the password after purchasing an item.


If the wireless network isn't secured, your computer will let you know before connecting. In some operating systems, there will also be an exclamation mark next to the network's name.
If you have to use the internet but don't have access to a secure network, change your passwords immediately the next time you log into a secure network.
If you have a wireless network at home, make sure it's secure and encrypted. Keep in mind that wireless routers typically aren't secure by default – you have to set this up yourself.

, This methodology goes for sites you visit on an unsecured connection as well. If there isn't a padlock icon to the left of the URL address and ""HTTPS"" in front of the ""www"" portion of the URL, it's best to avoid the site (and downloading anything from it) entirely if possible.

, In addition to avoiding sites without ""HTTPS"" and the padlock icon next to the URL, double-check the website's URL before entering your password on it. Some sites will attempt to steal your login information by posing as another site (this is known as a phishing scam); you can spot these sites by looking for extra (or missing) letters, dashes between words, and extra symbols.

For example, a site masquerading as Facebook might have faceboook.com as its URL.
Sites which display dashes between multiple words in the site name itself (the words in between ""www"" and "".com"") are generally not reliable.

, Not only does file sharing often violate intellectual property laws, but file-sharing websites are crawling with hackers. You may think you're downloading the latest hit song or a new movie, but the file actually is a virus or malware in disguise.

Many of these files are designed in such a way that the virus or malware hidden within won't be picked up by anti-virus software screenings. The virus won't infect your system until you try to play the file.

, Don't enter account or credit card information on a site that doesn't have ""https://"" written before the ""www"" section of the website address. The ""s"" indicates the site is secure. Sites without that won't encrypt or protect your data., You may think you're just sharing with friends, but revealing too much about yourself and your life on social media can make you vulnerable to hackers. Share personal information directly with people who need to know rather than openly posting on social media."

Contact one of the national CRAs.,
Request an initial alert.,
Request an extended alert.,
Think about requesting a credit freeze.",How to Protect Your Identity After an Online Data Breach2," You can request a fraud alert be placed on your credit report by calling one of the CRAs. You only have to contact one. It will then contact the other two. You can reach the CRAs at:Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
Experian: 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion 1-800-680-7289

, You can get an alert placed on your file for 90 days if you think that you are about to become the victim of identity theft. Once you have the alert in place, then a creditor will have to take steps to verify that the person trying to take out credit is actually you.


As part of the alert, you can provide a phone number which the creditor must call.This way, you can catch an identity thief trying to take out credit in your name.

, If you were actually the victim of identity theft, then you can get an extended report. It is good for seven years.An extended alert works like the initial alert. A creditor will have to verify that whoever is taking out credit is actually you. Generally, the creditor will have to call a phone number to confirm.

, A credit freeze provides even more protection. With a credit freeze, no one can get access to your credit report. Because creditors don’t usually extend credit without seeing a report, you can halt anyone from taking out new credit.You can contact the CRAs to request a credit freeze.
You will have to pay for the credit freeze. Each state has different rules about credit freezes.

Monitor your credit and bank accounts.,
Request new cards.,
Change your passwords to online accounts.",How to Protect Your Identity After an Online Data Breach3," You should regularly monitor your credit and banking accounts. Go through your monthly statements and check for any purchases or withdrawals that you did not authorize. If you want, you could sign up for online access to your accounts. In this way, you could check with greater frequency.


If you notice a purchase made that you didn’t authorize, then contact your bank or credit card company quickly. You have only a limited amount of time. For example, you must report an unauthorized purchase within 60 days of the date the statement on which the charge appears is mailed to you.You also have only 60 days to report an unauthorized debit charge.See Dispute a Debit Charge and Dispute a Credit Card Charge for more information on disputing unauthorized charges.

, If an unauthorized purchase is made on your credit cards or debit cards, then you should cancel them and request new cards. Also create new PINs for your cards as soon as you receive them.

, If your passwords were stolen, you should immediately change them. You should change passwords for any website that contains financial or sensitive personal information, such as bank accounts, credit card accounts, or retail sites.You can also change your passwords to social media accounts, although you might not have to do it immediately.
Make sure that the new password is strong. A strong password should have a mix of numbers, letters, and symbols. Also use both upper-case and lower-case letters, which will make your password harder to guess.For example, “$WiK4!w” is harder to guess than “wikihow.”

In addition to reporting the theft, you can get other helpful information from their website.At the website, click “Get Started.”
If you ever have a question, you can always chat with a tech specialist. Click on the “chat with our support team” icon in the upper-right corner of the page. You can get help Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 8:00 pm EST.

, If yours isn’t listed, then click on “A breach not listed here.”


You will then have to report whether someone used your information to open accounts or make purchases. You can also report that you are not aware of any misuse., If you are reporting a new breach, which is not listed at the FTC website, then you will need to tell the FTC what information was exposed (e.g., Social Security Numbers, online passwords, etc.)


You will also have to tell the FTC what the identity thief used your personal identification to purchase. For example, the thief might have opened credit card accounts or obtained loans using your identity.
You will then be asked for personal information and relevant information about the theft. You also should provide information about any suspect.Review your complaint before submitting it to the FTC. At the end, you can print off an Identity Theft Affidavit. You will need to show this affidavit to the police.

, The FTC will tell you what steps you should take next in order to protect your identity after the data breach. This checklist is very useful. You can print it off and then work your way down the steps.


For example, some companies whose data was breached are providing free credit monitoring. You will be given a phone number to call.

, If someone used your information to make purchases or open accounts, then you should file an identity theft report. Once you have completed filing the report, get a copy of it. You will need the following information to show to the police:evidence of the theft, such as credit card statements, bills, IRS notices, or other information
your valid, personal identification, such as valid driver’s license or passport
proof of your address
your copy of the FTC Identity Theft Affidavit

Understand the risks.,
Have your border router configured for packet filtering.,
Avoid direct IP user authentication.,
Rely on encryption.,
Choose a reliable ISP.,
Work on your overall security.,
Invest in spoofing detection software.",How to Prevent IP Spoofing," If you are not familiar with the term, IP spoofing denominates a practice of using different types of software to change the source or destination information in the header of the IP packets. Since these packets are sent through a connectionless network (packets in connectionless networks are also known as datagrams), they can be sent without a handshake with the recipient, which makes them convenient for manipulation. Number of ways to abuse IP or TCP spoofing (the latter mostly being a non-issue these days) kept decreasing with improvements in the overall online security, development of new protocols and increase in user awareness, but there are still people who use this for nefarious purposes. The most common abuses of IP spoofing today revolve around:


IP user authentication based exploits – where the intruder impersonates the IP of the internal network they are trying to penetrate.
Denial-of-service attacks – either direct where the attacker modifies the destination in the IP packets, sending them to the target address; or indirect, where the attacker sends out requests to different reflectors or amplificators, with the IP’s header forged so as to imply that the target site is the source of the packet. This is usually sent to a number of different reflectors/amplificators, which all reply to the target site, sometimes with a response which is much larger than the request itself. ;
, This will prevent some of the possible exploits of IP spoofing. Ingress filtering prevents the reception of packets that are determined to be coming from a different IP address block than what is stated as the source in their header. When correctly implemented, this prevents attackers from flooding your system with requests. Egress filtering prevents packets from leaving your network, if their header seems to be tampered with, which prevents your site form being used as an amplificator or reflector. , If you have a large network, you shouldn’t allow internal authentication based on IP. Setting up additional layers of protection might come at the cost of some convenience, but it will keep your system much more secure.

, Cryptographic protocols such as HTTP Secure (HTTPS), Secure Shell (SSH) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) remove much of the risk of spoofing by encrypting the packets so that they cannot be modified by attackers, and requiring authentication upon receiving a packet.

, Wishing to reduce the threat of IP spoofing, most of the Internet Service Providers have for a while been offering network ingress filtering. This is to say they try to collaborate with each other in the attempt to monitor the path of the packets, and detect the ones that seem unreliable. Checking whether your provider is a part of this agreement is a step in the right direction.

, Seeing how IP spoofing can be combined with other exploits, giving your entire setup a security upgrade is always a good idea. This extends from penetration testing and introduction of two-factor authentication to educating your employees/partners on the online security best practices, like not using public networks to access sensitive information and similar.

, While following all of the steps above should do a decent job of protecting you from IP spoofing, you still want something to alert you if you’ve been an intended victim of one. Luckily, there is an abundance of software out there that can help you with this issue; you just need to find something that fits your needs and budget.

"
Install one of the extensions described above.,
Use an exact address to block one element only.,
Use an asterisk to make more general filters.,
Look for replaceable content in the address.,
Prevent the filter from blocking useful content.",How to Remove Ads on Google Chrome Using AdBlock3," An ad filter is a URL that the ad-blocking extension looks for when deciding what to block. Both AdBlock and Adblock Plus allow you to write your own filters, so you can catch ads that slipped through the built-in filters, or block non-ad content that annoys you.


A full tutorial is available here, but the instructions below may be easier to follow for beginners.

, If there's one specific image, video, or other web page element that you want to block, all you need is the associated web address. Right click that element and click ""Copy Image URL"" or ""Copy Video URL."" For other types of content, you can discover the address by using the ""Block ad"" command, described in their respective sections. This should open a pop-up window where you can select an element and find out the address.


For example, if you add the filter http://www.website.com/top-banner/image-of-clowns.jpg, only that specific image will be blocked. If you visit the same page later and it displays ""image-of-puppies.jpg"" instead, you will see that image.

, Replacing part of the URL with the asterisk symbol * (Shift 8 on most English keyboards) will block all elements that contain anything where that asterisk is located. Here are a few examples:



http://www.website.com/top-banner/* will block anything that website.com stores in its ""top banner"" folder, hopefully preventing you from seeing anything in that ad frame. (Note that not all websites use addresses that are this obvious.)

http://www.website.com/*/image-of-clowns.jpg will block the image ""image-of-clowns.jpg"" on all website.com pages.

http://www.website.com/* will block all content on website.com. If a website you tried to remove ads from is now a blank page, you probably used an * in the wrong place.

, Many addresses include strings of seemingly random letters and numbers that identify the specific ad, the size, or other features. Delete these and replace them with a single * symbol.

, This is often the cause of using an * in the wrong place, but if the useful content and advertisement have very similar addresses, you may want to use one of these techniques:The ^ symbol at the end of a filter will restrict the filter to addresses that end there or follow with a ""separator character."" For example the filter website.com/ad^ will block ""website.com/ad/anything-here"" or ""website.com/ad?=send-malware-yes"" but it will not block ""website.com/adventures-of-tintin"".
Add the | symbol (the vertical pipe, usually above the enter key) to the beginning or end of a filter to only block addresses that begin or end at that point. For example, the filter swf will block all addresses that contain ""swf"" (all Flash videos, but a lot of other content as well). ""|swf"" will only block addresses that start with ""swf"" (not a useful filter). ""swf|"" will only block addresses that end with ""swf"" (Flash videos only).

Click and drag on a bookmark or folder to move it.,
Click on ""Folder▼"" or ""Organize▼"" to add folders or bookmarks.,
Right click on a link or folder to rename it.,
Use the search bar to search your bookmarks, including their content.",How to Organize Chrome Bookmarks1," This is the easiest way to organize your bookmarks and folders without skipping around multiple menus or bars. The Bookmarks Manager lets you order your bookmarks, make and organize folders, rename or edit bookmarks, and search all of your links.Make sure you have the latest version of Bookmarks Manager by navigating to ""About Google Chrome"" (URL: chrome://chrome/). If you don't have the latest version it will auto-update from this site.;
, This is how you adjust your settings in Chrome. Click on these bars and a small white menu will appear, starting with “New tab.”


This icon is often called the ""Hamburger Icon"" colloquially., From here you can see your bookmarks and do some basic organizing.


Click “Bookmark this page,” to automatically bookmark whatever website is currently open in your browser. “Bookmark all Open Pages” will make a bookmark for every open tab you have.
Click “Show Bookmark Bar” to conveniently display your bookmarks as buttons underneath your search bar.
Click and drag your bookmarks to reorder them or place them in folders.
Right-click on a link to edit, rename, or copy and paste a bookmark.

, This opens up a customizable page that lets you easily edit your bookmarks. Your bookmarks are displayed as a list in the center and all of your folders are displayed in a bar on the left. Double-clicking on a bookmark opens it up in a separate tab, while clicking on a folder shows you the bookmarks in that folder.

, Look at the folders on the left side of the screen. You will likely see a series of ""nested"" folders, which is when you have one folder inside of another. They will be organized into any of three basic folders. All of your bookmarks must fit into these three larger folders.



Bookmarks Bar: This is reserved for your most popular bookmarks. Anything in here will also show up on the bar at the top of your Chrome screen.

Other Bookmarks: This collects everything you have not put in your Bookmark Bar.

Mobile Bookmarks: If you've connected your Google accounts between your phone and computer then this folder will appear with all of the bookmarks you've saved on your Chrome Mobile App.

, Organizing your bookmarks from this page is easy -- simply click a link, hold down the mouse button, and drag it to the folder you want. Let go of the mouse to drop the bookmark in.

, Clicking either of the small words at the top of your bookmark manager will bring up a small menu that allows you to add new folders or links. You will be asked to name the bookmark and attach a link, or choose where the folder goes. None of these decisions are permanent, however, as you can always drag and drop them into new places.


You can also undo your past changes from this menu.

, You can also edit the link or copy and paste the bookmark somewhere else. Simply right-click and choose ""Edit Bookmark/Folder"" to give a description, change the URL, or rename the link.

, This is the best new feature with Chrome’s Bookmarks Manager—the search bar reads the titles of your bookmarks and words on the pages too to let you search anything. For example, if you favorited a few “Best Movies of the Year” lists and want to quickly see if American Hustle was on them, you could search for the title without clicking through every bookmark.


This is a great organizing tool, as you can search something like ""Movies"" and move every result into its own folder.

You can also push ""command + ,"" on your keyboard to open Chrome Preferences.;
, Google Chrome is a Google web browser. If you have a Google account (email), then I recommend signing in so that you can have full access to your preferences and settings. If you are using a shared computer, this step is not recommended.

, Do you want your browser to open a new page each time you start Chrome? Do you want to continue with the pages you had open when you closed Chrome? Or do you want to open Chrome to a specific page (similar to a home page) or pages? Choose one of the three options. I personally enjoy the third option so that I can have my Pandora account, email account, Facebook account, and news source open when I start Chrome. If you chose the first two options, move to step four. If you chose the third option, open the page(s) you would like to choose as a home page(s) in separate tabs. Click ""set pages"" on the Chrome preference page. Then click ""Use current pages"" on the box that pops up. Finally, select your pages from the list that appears of the open pages you have available. I do not recommend selecting more than four pages, as it can become overwhelming and clutter your browser.

, If you chose the third option in step three, I would recommend using the home button or you can click ""Change"" link next to ""New Tab page"" and set one tab or more as your home. You can also choose to show or hide the bookmark bar. I recommend showing the bookmark bar. See step 6 for customization of the bookmark bar. You can also choose themes with Google chrome. To browse these themes click ""Get themes"". A new tab will open with theme options. Feel free to browse these themes and see if there are any you like. I prefer the ""Classic"" Google theme but recommend trying various options. If you choose any you are not interested in you can click ""undo"" under the bookmark menu after selecting a theme, or you can go back to the ""classic"" theme but choosing it under ""Google"" in the right hand toolbar under ""Themes"".

, I prefer to use Google search. You can also add multiple Chrome accounts to your browser but that will require each user to sign in and out of the browser. This is a good options for those who share a computer frequently and use the web browser often. Finally, you can choose to make Chrome your default browser so that links and other web functions will open in Chrome.

, This link gives directions for PC users, so substitute the ""control"" function for the Mac OS X ""command"" key. I choose the web sites that I use frequently and sometimes put them in folders. For example, I have a folder called ""Bills"" with links to each of the websites where I can pay my bills online.

, It is helpful to know what browsing and privacy options are available even if you do not choose to use them. Happy surfing!

Windows 10 and 8.1 - Right-click on the Start button and select Control Panel.
Windows 8 - Press ⊞ Win+X and select Control Panel.
Windows 7, Vista, and XP - Click the Start menu and select Control Panel.;
, If you're using Windows XP, select ""Add or Remove Programs"".

BrowserProtect
Delta Chrome Toolbar
Delta toolbar
Yontoo
Mixi.DJ

, Read all of the prompts carefully to remove the program from your system. Repeat the process for any program listed above, as well as other recent programs that are unfamiliar.

, Even if you don't use it, Internet Explorer is still tied to your system and if it's infected it can lead to a complete re-infection.


Open Internet Explorer and click the Gear or Tools menu. If you don't see the menu bar, press Alt.
Select ""Internet options""
Click the ""Advanced"" tab and click ""Reset.""
Check the ""Delete personal settings"" box and click ""Reset."" Close Internet Explorer after resetting.

, Resetting your Chrome browser back to its default settings is the quickest way to remove Delta Search. You won't lose your bookmarks.


Click the Chrome Menu button (☰) and select ""Settings"".
Click the ""Show advanced settings"" link and scroll to the bottom.
Click ""Reset settings"" and then click ""Reset"" to confirm.

, If you use Firefox on a regular basis, or even just once in a while, you'll want to reset it as well. If you don't use Firefox, skip down to the next step.Click the Menu button (☰).
Click the ""?"" button and select ""Troubleshooting Information.""
Click ""Refresh Firefox"" and then ""Refresh Firefox"" again to confirm.

, If you use any other browsers, you'll need to reset them as well. The process for each browser is different, but likely similar to one of the methods outlined above. For details, check your browser's Support website.

, Delta Search may change your browser shortcuts, causing them to launch the Delta Search website whenever you use them. These shortcut changes will persist even after resetting your browsers. The antimalware community BleepingComputer developed a free utility that will scan your shortcuts and automatically remove redirects.


Download the tool for free from http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/shortcut-cleaner/.

, You may be prompted by Windows to confirm that you want to run this downloaded program. As long as you downloaded it from BleepingComputer, it will be safe to run. The scan will begin immediately, and will only take a few moments to complete.

, A text file called ""sc-cleaner.txt"" will be created on your desktop. Open this file to see a list of shortcuts that were fixed by the cleaner.

, The cleaner program only looks in the common areas for shortcuts. If you have shortcuts to your browsers in odd places, you'll need to check these manually:


Right-click on a shortcut and select ""Properties"".
Find the ""Target"" field. This is the path to your internet browser application. If the end of the Target field has a web address, remove it so that it just points to the application.

, Uninstalling the software and resetting your browsers is not enough to keep Delta Search from coming back. You'll need to use a few free anti-malware scanning programs to find and remove every last trace of Delta Search. Download the installers for the following programs:


AdwCleaner - toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/

Malwarebytes Antimalware - malwarebytes.org (Select the free version)
HitmanPro - surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro


, When you start AdwCleaner, click the ""Scan"" button to begin scanning your system. The scanning process may take about 20 minutes or so to complete, depending on the speed of your computer. Once the scan is complete, click the ""Clean"" button to remove anything that AdwCleaner finds.

, When you launch the program for the first time, make sure that you check for any available updates. Click the ""Scan Now"" button to begin scanning your system. This scan will likely take around 30 minutes to complete. Click the ""Quarantine All"" button after the scan has completed to remove anything it found.

, HitmanPro will begin scanning automatically as soon as it finishes installing, or you can choose to run it without installing. Once the scan is complete, click the ""Activate free license"" button. This will allow you to remove anything HitmanPro finds for free. The free trial is only good for 30 days, but hopefully you'll only need it this once, and you can always reinstall it later to restart the trial., This may not be strictly necessary, but sometimes rebooting will help the scanners find something that was missed the first time. If your scanners all come back clean, you're probably good to go.

A hostname is typically a website address. Replace hostname with the website that or server that you want to ping. For example, to ping wikiHow’s main web server, type ping www.wikihow.com.
An IP address is a computer’s location on a network, either locally or on the internet. If you know the IP address that you want to ping, replace IP address with it. For example, to ping the IP address 192.168.1.1, type ping 192.168.1.1.
To have your PC ping itself, type ping 127.0.0.1.

, A successful Ping command will return lines that display how long it took the address to respond. TTL represents the number of hops that occurred during the packet transfer process. The lower the number, the more routers the packet passed through.Time is how long in milliseconds the connection took:Reply from 173.203.142.5: bytes=32 time=102ms TTL=48
Reply from 173.203.142.5: bytes=32 time=105ms TTL=48
Reply from 173.203.142.5: bytes=32 time=105ms TTL=48
Reply from 173.203.142.5: bytes=32 time=108ms TTL=48


You may need to press Ctrl + C to stop pinging.

, After the operation is completed a summary of the results will be displayed. Lost packets mean your connection to the address is unreliable, and data is being lost in the transfer. The summary will also display the average time the connection took:Ping statistics for 173.203.142.5:
Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
Minimum = 102ms, Maximum = 108ms, Average = 105ms

"
Check your entry.,
Check your connection.",How to Ping an IP Address4," One of the common error reports looks similar to:Ping request could not find host www.wikihow.com. Please check the name and try again.
This usually means that the you have misspelled the hostname.


Try retyping it to correct any spelling errors. If that doesn’t fix the problem, then try another well-known hostname, such as a search engine or news site. If that reports “Unknown host,” then the problem is most likely the address of the domain name server.
Ping using the host’s IP address instead of its name (ex. 173.203.142.5). If this is successful then either the address you are using for the domain name server is incorrect or it is unreachable or down.

, Another error message is:sendto: No route to host
This may mean the address of the gateway is incorrect or that the connection from your PC is not up and running.


Ping 127.0.0.1: that's your own PC. If this fails, your TCP/IP is not functioning correctly, and your network adapter needs to be reconfigured.Check your wireless connection or the connection from your PC to your router, especially if it was working previously.
Most PC network ports have an indicator light that indicates a good connection and one that blinks as data is transferred. As the ping command transmits packets at about 1 per second, you should be able to see the data light blink.
Check that the router has the proper indicators light (and no faults), including the one that indicates a good connection to your PC. If a fault indicator is on, follow the cable from your PC to the router to make sure it is properly connected, then call your cable or broadband provider if necessary.

Use secure passwords.,
Change passwords regularly.,
Get permission before modifying the network.,
Do not tell crackers and hackers anything.,
If you are not in the office, secure your computer system.",How to Minimise Security Risks from Hackers and Crackers," The passwords you use should contain at least 7, and more than 12 characters if your network supports this limit. It will be useful to use passwords which include letters, numbers and punctuation marks. No need to worry if your network does not allow punctuation marks for your password, you can use a combination of letters and numbers. The passwords will be more secure if you drop vowels and replace letters in memorable words. For example, instead of writing ""personal"" you can use ""p3sne11"" as a password.;
, If you are not using a single use password system, you should change your passwords regularly. Nowadays, most of the modern management systems force passwords to expire after a particular amount of time. So you need to be aware of that.

, If you are a network service provider, this function is of significant importance. You can also set up a policy for making network changes that makes it easy to follow and carry out.

, Do not tell them which type of software you are using. If you reveal this information you are reducing cracker's time to crack into your network system. Some network administrators reveal this sort of information to the crackers without realizing it.

, There are many network access programs that allow users to save user IDs, passwords, dial in numbers, user name, email addresses and so on to make it easy for the user to log in to those programs. You need to be careful. Overall, it is useful not to save any of these user IDs or passwords or anything like that except if it is relevant. One of the best ways is to secure your computer system with a password, both on the computer BIOS and on screen saver.

Pay to have your data deleted automatically.",How to Maintain Your Privacy Online," VPNs route your browser traffic through a server other than your local one, which makes it impossible for your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to see your browsing history. Things to look for in a VPN include the following:


On an HTTPS site - Never download browser security software from a site whose URL doesn't begin in ""https""; unencrypted (non-HTTPS) sites make it easy for other people to steal your information.

Based outside of the United States - VPN servers based outside of the United States aren't subject to US guidelines, meaning they can't be forced to expose users in the event of an investigation.

Multiple-device support - Protecting your computer won't do anything for your mobile phone or tablet. Find a VPN that has an iOS and/or Android extension as well to stay protected across all of your devices.;
, Keep in mind that, when it comes to sponsored content, you may not get an honest review for a paid spot in a list. Some things you might compare are ratings across multiple sites, performance, overall security, and price.

You can find trustworthy VPN comparisons on https://thatoneprivacysite.net/simple-vpn-comparison-chart/ and on https://privacytoolsio.github.io/privacytools.io/#vpn/.
For specific VPNs, try AirVPN (https://airvpn.org/) and BlackVPN (https://www.blackvpn.com/).

, Some sites, such as CNET, will provide download mirrors for sponsored or preferred software. Unless there is no other place to download the VPN and you're positive of the download link's validity, refrain from downloading your VPN from anywhere but the official site.

Again, if the site isn't HTTPS-encrypted, don't download a VPN from it.
Most VPNs are paid options, so you'll likely need to pay before downloading. Consider using PayPal to pay instead of a credit or debit card.

, Some VPNs simply interface with your preferred browser, while others necessitate installing the program to your computer and activating it before browsing., VPNs don't automatically make all of your browsing private, since non-HTTPS sites can still pull information from your browser and publicly display it. To get the most out of your VPN, stick to well-encrypted sites and refrain from giving out your information.

Half of the privacy battle comes from choosing to stay anonymous while using encrypted services. If you enter your email address, use Facebook ""Like"" buttons on other sites, or perform other identifying actions, your VPN won't necessarily prevent that information from being viewed by other people.

, Most social networks will allow you to customize your privacy settings. These settings dictate how others can search for you, and what information is available for the public to view. Most social networks have default settings that allow a lot of information through, so it is up to you to change the settings to increase your privacy.

To make Facebook private, click the downward-facing arrow in the top-right corner of the page and select Settings, then click Privacy. Here you can set who can see your posts, how people can look you up, and if you want search engines to show your profile. If you want to stay as private as possible, limit everything to just your Friends, and then remove any friends from your list that you don’t want to share with.
On Twitter, your tweets are public by default, and anyone can see them. You can change this to ""Protected"" mode in the Twitter settings menu; protected tweets cannot be retweeted or viewed by people you haven't approved, and they will not show up in Google searches.In Google+, your privacy settings are the same as those for all of your Google accounts. To manage your privacy options, click your picture in the top-right corner, and then select Account. In the left menu of the Account page, select Privacy. Here you can adjust what information can be seen by whom. Anything marked ""Public"" can be seen by anyone that searches for you. You can change your settings so that only the people that you designate can see specific information.

, Sign out of your social network site, and then search for yourself on that site. Browse your profile and ensure that there isn’t any data on there that you don’t want publicly accessible. If you find information that you want hidden, enter your profile and either remove it or set it to hidden., Use any popular search engine to search your own name. Take note of what appears, and then do what you can to remove this information. For example, if a web search shows your profile for a high school reunion site, contact that specific site to remove your information.

If you have unused accounts on old sites, go back and delete them to remove your information from that site’s database.

, Even if you set everything to private, the companies that run the social networks still have access to all of your information. By limiting the amount of information you share, you’ll limit the amount of knowledge these companies have about you., Many social networks, such as Facebook, allow you to include the location you are at when you make a post. These locations are then saved to a database. Avoid sharing your location unless it is critical to your post that you share where you are., By signing up for a social network, you are already compromising your privacy, even if you never post. Facebook can track your web use through the Like system, and Google does similar things with their +1 system. Even if all of your settings are set to Private, these companies will still use your information to attempt to sell you things., Internet Explorer comes bundled with all versions of Windows, but the browser is more susceptible to attack than browsers such as Firefox and Chrome. These browsers are available for free, so consider switching to help protect yourself from viruses and malware.You should avoid using browsers like Tor or I2P since these sites are predominately used for illicit activity, and the simple act of using one may draw unwanted attention to you.In general, stay off of the dark web when attempting to skirt surveillance. Unless you're extremely careful and well-experienced in navigating the dark web, you're likely to run into malware or worse.

, Wi-Fi networks that don't require a password--or even networks that do require a password but accommodate several people at once (e.g., an airport or a coffee shop)--put you at increased risk of having your data stolen.

If you must use an unsecured network, refrain from logging into social media, bank accounts, or other sensitive places.

, Websites can choose whether or not to honor this request, but in general it will lower the number of websites that track your actions online. You can turn this on in most browsers ion the Advanced section of the Settings menu.

Do not assume that by selecting this you will no longer be tracked. Many websites will still collect your browsing information.

, These plugins are typically much more effective than simply enabling Do Not Track, and they can be installed for free. One of the most popular plugins is DoNotTrackMe from Abine.uBlock Origin, which can be found in the Chrome, Firefox, and Opera app stores, is a well-reviewed app that blocks all ads in addition to attempts to access your IP address from third-parties and your ISP.

, Programs such as Skype and web services such as Google Search have recently been shown to be compromised by US government surveillance. To protect your web browsing and messaging, switch to programs that aren’t located in the US, so that they do not fall under the jurisdiction of US law.

Popular secure searching alternatives include Startpage (https://www.startpage.com/), DuckDuckGo (https://duckduckgo.com/), and Ixquick (https://www.ixquick.eu/).
Popular messaging alternatives include: Jitsi (https://jitsi.org/), Pidgin (https://pidgin.im/), and Adium (https://adium.im/).

, This is the secure form of the standard HTTP address, and data transferred to and from HTTPS websites is encrypted. Most secure sites will automatically load the HTTPS version of their website when you visit, but you can force it to load on all supported websites by using a browser plugin such as HTTPS Everywhere (https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) for Firefox.

If a site doesn’t support HTTPS, then there is nothing that you can do to force an HTTPS connection. Avoid entering any personal information into these sites.
You can identify a secure site by looking for the Secure indicator in your web browser. Each browser shows it a little differently, but in general you should see a lock icon or the word ""Secure"" next to the address of the site you are visiting. You should also be able to see “https” at the beginning of the address.

, A proxy acts as a middleman between you and the internet. Requests are sent from your computer to the proxy, and then from the proxy to the internet. Results are returned in the opposite direction. This has the effect of masking your computer, as websites will think the proxy server is the one that is requesting the information.

If you connect to the proxy through a VPN, then all of the data that is sent between your machine and the proxy is encrypted.

, You can use GPG (a free encryption solution) to exchange encrypted email messages. GPG is end-to-end encryption that requires both the recipient and the sender have created and exchanged their GPG Public Keys. You can use GPG on Windows or on Linux., There are multiple companies online that exist solely to collect data on you and then sell it to marketers. These sites take public records, social network information, browsing information, and more to create a profile about you that they can sell. Opting out of these lists can be time consuming and difficult.

, Several sites have lists of the companies that collect data, as well as information on how to remove yourself. This typically involves emailing and calling the company until you reach someone who can delete your information. This can be a very time-consuming and frustrating process, as many of these companies purposefully make it difficult to remove yourself.

, There are services available that will delete your records from listing sites. These services essentially perform the same functions that you can do for free, but take care of it for you so that you don’t have to spend your time trying to track down sites and people to talk to.


These services are often subscription based. This is because even if you remove yourself from a list, you will often be placed back on it after a few months. These services repeat the deletion process every few months to ensure that you stay off the lists.

Alphabetize a folder.",How to Display Bookmarks in Chrome2," From late 2014 until June 2015, Chrome experimented with a more visual, tile-based Bookmark Manager.If you haven't updated Chrome since that time, the instructions below will not match your browser.


If you're in the minority of users who preferred the visual system, install the Bookmark Manager extension from the Chrome Web Store.
Apart from this temporary change, the Bookmark Manager has stayed mostly the same since a revamp in 2010 (version 5) and bug fixes in 2011 (version 15)., Press Ctrl + ⌥ Option + B on Windows, or ⌘ Command + ⌥ Option + B on Mac. This opens Bookmark Manager in a new tab.


You can also use the Bookmarks option in the top menu or the menu button, or right-click the Bookmarks Bar and select it from the drop down menu.

, Click on the Bookmarks Bar folder in the left pane. Drag the individual bookmarks in the right pane in whatever order you like. Drag bookmarks you don't use often to the Other Bookmarks folder. This folder always exists, but will not show up on your bar unless it has something in it.

, Click the word Folders at the top of the left pane, then Add Folder. This will create a folder inside whichever folder you have selected. Drag bookmarks into folders however you would like them organized.


All bookmarks and folders will show up inside ""Bookmarks Bar"" or ""Other Bookmarks."" You cannot delete or rename these top-level folders.

, Choose a folder in the left pane. Above the right pane, click the word Organize. Select ""Reorder by title"" to arrange all bookmarks in that folder alphabetically."

You don't need to erase all of these categories, depending on why you are deleting your history. In most cases, it will suffice to delete the browsing history, the download history, and the cookies.

, Clearing your browsing history deletes the local record of any web addresses you've visited; the cached text of those pages; snapshots of those pages for images that appear on the New Tab page; and any IP addresses pre-fetched from those pages., The list of files you've downloaded using Google Chrome will be erased, but the actual files will remain on your computer. If you have downloaded sensitive files, but you have hidden them well on your computer, deleting your download history might make those files more secure. Furthermore, clearing your download history can free up a small chunk of memory (depending on how much you have downloaded) for other applications.

, These files contain user information, such as preferences for websites or profile information.
Site data: HTML5 enabled storage types including application caches, Web Storage data, Web SQL Database data, and Indexed Database data.
Plug-in data: Any client-side data stored by plug-ins that use the NPAPI ClearSiteData API.

, The cache includes the text and content of webpages you've visited in Google Chrome, and ""deleting the cache"" removes these files from your computer. Browsers store elements of webpages to speed up the loading of the webpage during your next visit. Thus, if you delete the cache, it may take slightly longer to navigate familiar websites.

, If you do this, all records of usernames and passwords will be deleted. If you're using a Mac, your password records are deleted from Keychain Access. If you decide to delete your passwords, make sure that there you have written down or otherwise logged them elsewhere—you don't want to find yourself locked out of an important account because you have forgotten a username or password that used to fill in automatically.

, This will delete all your Autofill entries, as well as the records of any text that you've entered on web forms. This may clear clutter—say, if your shipping address forms automatically fill in with the ghosts of addresses past, you can erase those Autofills forever. Bear in mind, however, that you will need to manually re-enter any information that you have set to Autofill: names, addresses, credit card numbers, contact information. It may be inconvenient to delete this data unless you are facing an excess of clutter.

, Selecting this box will erase the data from the apps you’ve added to Chrome from the Chrome Web Store. This includes the local storage used by Gmail Offline.

, The Google Chrome Support Team recommends that you deauthorize content licenses before selling or donating your computer.
