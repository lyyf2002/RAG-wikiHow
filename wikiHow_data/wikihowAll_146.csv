Uninstall the software.,
Remove the toolbar.,
Reset your browser settings.,
Delete cookies.",How to Get Rid of Unwanted Toolbars1," Toolbars are often installed alongside software, and both will need to be removed in order to get rid of the toolbar. Make sure to uninstall the software first so that the toolbar doesn't reinstall itself after being removed.



Windows - Open the Control Panel and select ""Programs"", ""Programs and Features"", or ""Add/Remove Programs"". Wait for the list of installed programs to load, which may take a minute or two. Find the offending program in the list, select it, and click Uninstall. There may be multiple programs installed by the toolbar, so uninstall anything that you don't use or doesn't seem familiar.

Mac - Open your Applications folder and look for a folder called Toolbars. Delete this folder to delete the main software for any installed toolbars. Also look for folders with the toolbar company's name and delete those as well. If you are trying to get rid of an invasive toolbar like Softonic, open the Library folder, open the Application Support folder and delete the ""Conduit"" folder. Also look in the Input Managers folder in your Library folder for anything labeled ""CTLoader"". Delete this as well.;
, After the program has been uninstalled, you can remove the toolbar using your browser settings. The process varies slightly depending on which browser you are using:



Chrome - Click the Menu (☰) button, hover over ""Tools"", and then click ""Extensions"". Find the toolbar in the list of installed extensions and click the trashcan icon to remove it. Restart your browser.

Firefox - Click the Menu (☰) button and select ""Add-ons"". Click the ""Extensions"" tab and locate the toolbar that you want to remove. Click Remove to uninstall it. Restart your browser.

Internet Explorer - Click the Gear icon and select ""Manage add-ons"". This will open a new window. Select ""Toolbars and Extensions"" in the left menu, and then find the toolbar you want to remove. Click Disable to remove it.

Safari - Click the Safari menu and select ""Preferences"". Click the ""Extensions"" tab. Select the toolbar that you want to remove and click Uninstall. Restart your browser.

Download anti-adware software.,
Run the adware scans.,
Run an antivirus scan.,
Reinstall your operating system.",How to Get Rid of Unwanted Toolbars2," Sometimes, no matter what you try, toolbars and browser redirects just won't go away. For cases like these you will need anti-adware software. These are free programs that scan for and remove adware and malware from your system. Popular programs include Malwarebytes Antimalware, Spybot Search & Destroy, and Adwcleaner.


All of these programs should be downloaded directly from the developer. Avoid sites like Download.com or Softonic, as they will attempt to install more toolbars.
Unlike antivirus programs, you can and should install multiple anti-adware scanners. They will not conflict with one another and each may pick up something that the other missed.

, Run each of the scans after you have finished installing the programs. Running scans may take a while, but you will likely get several results. Ensure that all of the results are checked, and then remove them using the removal tools provided by the program.


For more detailed instructions, see this guide.
For better results, run the adware scans while in Safe Mode.

, After running your anti-adware scans, run a full scan of your computer using your antivirus program. Run the scan again in Safe Mode. Remove any viruses or other threats that appear during the scan.

, If you just can't get an infection to go away, your only other option may be a complete reinstallation of your operating system. This is actually less daunting that it may seem. The most time-consuming process is typically backing up your important files, but if you have a back-up system already in place then the time investment is minimal. See the following guides for detailed instructions on reinstalling your operating system:

Delete your Temporary Internet Files.,
Remove unnecessary add-ons.,
Reset your modem/router.,
Reset your browser.,
Reinstall Internet Explorer.",How to Fix Windows Internet Explorer Not Responding," Numerous Internet Explorer updates include stability and bug fixes, which may solve the problems you are having. Internet Explorer is updated through the Windows Update program. See this article for details on installing the latest updates for Windows and Internet Explorer.;
, Malware and other browser hijackers are one of the primary causes of Internet Explorer non-responsive errors. Running regular malware scans is part of a good maintenance routine, and can prevent a lot of problems and security issues. Some of the best anti-malware programs include MalwareBytes, Spybot Search & Destroy, and AdwCleaner.


Run scans with a couple different anti-malware programs, since not all programs will detect the same things.

, Viruses can cause your browser to stop functioning, so it's advisable to always have an antivirus program running in the background. Open your antivirus program's control panel and check that its virus definitions are up to date. Run a virus scan as well to ensure that a virus isn't causing the problem.


If you don't have anti-virus installed, see this article for details on getting one set up.

, Corrupt temporary files can cause issues when your browser tries to load them. Clearing out your temporary files also frees up some space on your hard drive, and can improve the performance of the browser in general.


To delete your Temporary Internet Files without opening Internet Explorer, first open the Control Panel. This can be found in the Start menu, or by pressing ⊞ Win+X if you are using Windows 8.
Open the ""Network & Internet"" category and select ""Internet Options"".
Click the Delete... button in the General tab.
Check the ""Temporary Internet files and website files"" box.
Click the Delete button to delete the files.

Use CCleaner to get rid of lingering files that may be causing problems. CCleaner is much more comprehensive than using the built-in deletion (Disk Cleanup) tools that Windows provides.

, Internet Explorer can be expanded through the use of add-ons and thereby most toolbars, but these sometimes end up causing instability or bogging down the program. If you have too many add-ons or unstable add-ons installed, they could be causing Internet Explorer to crash. Try disabling add-ons one at a time until Internet Explorer starts working again, or disable all of them at once.Click the Gear icon or the Tools menu and select ""Manage add-ons"".
On the left side of the new window, you can select which types of add-ons you would like to manage. The ""Toolbars and Extensions"" section will likely have most of the add-ons you've added.
Look for add-ons you don't recognize or don't use any more. Select an add-on and then click the Disable button at the bottom of the window to turn the add-on off.
Look for add-ons that were installed around the same time Internet Explorer began giving your problems. These may be the culprit.
Note that some add-ons are installed by default by Microsoft and companies like Oracle (Java).

, Sometimes stagnant connections can cause a non-responsive Internet Explorer issue. Unplugging for the sixty seconds and plugging it back in to re-initialize sometimes works to help grab a new IP address for you to operate on.

, If disabling add-ons, running malware scans, and deleting temporary files still doesn't fix the issue, your last resort before reinstalling is resetting Internet Explorer. Bringing the browser back to the settings it had when it was first installed on your PC, will most often times fix these things. However, you will lose your history, favorites, and any other changes you've made, so remember to backup your files beforehand.You can reset Internet Explorer from within the browser, or from the Internet Options section of the Control Panel. In Internet Explorer, click the Gear icon or Tools menu and select Internet Options.
Click the Advanced Tab.
Click the Reset... button. You will be asked to confirm that you want to reset. Make sure that it is set to delete your personal settings, as these could be causing the problem.

, If nothing else works, you can try reinstalling Internet Explorer. This may fix the program if it has been corrupted. You can download the Internet Explorer installation file from the Microsoft website. Run the file and follow the prompts to reinstall the browser.


Windows 7 users should download Internet Explorer 11.
Windows Vista users should download Internet Explorer 9.
Windows XP users should download Internet Explorer 8.
Windows 8 users cannot reinstall Internet Explorer as it is built-in to Windows. Instead, it will have to be turned off and then turned back on. Turn it off from the Programs and Features window in the Control Panel. Select ""Turn Windows features on or off"" from the left menu, and then uncheck Internet Explorer 11. Reboot your computer, and then follow the same procedure to turn it back on."

, With some computers, you can easily just hold in the button on the computer, and when it boots up, you'll be given the option to run in a mode other than ""Start Windows Normally"".


Some websites have mentioned that people should continuously press F8, after the initial brand-screen of the computer boots up. This is another way to access this menu.
Being that you have your wired/wireless card connection unplugged, selecting ""Safe Mode with Networking"" is completely useless, and not necessary!

, You'll need to clean out the stored files in the cache, history, temporary files, and even cookies, along with blocking pop-up windows and even disabling some add-ons that might have been seen in the browser window that is being displayed.

, If not, most Windows operating systems can be freely updated with a firewall, by turning on the Windows Firewall. If outbound protection (which may be the case in this issue) is required, there are some programs out there (that run free of charge, and that can be downloaded and installed free-of-charge) that will protect your computer outbound too. One such program is called ""PC Tools Firewall Plus"" (one such place is through the CNet website).

, The first full scan may take a long bit of time, but, over time, this time may decrease a bit. A free and consistently updated program that works wonders in this process is Microsoft Security Essentials, but one of the many purchasable products works too, (if you'd rather not use any Microsoft products).

,,,,, Some things may only be fixed, after you contact an IT specialist (at your business) or a local computer-fixing company (for a home-user).

, But if it starts acting up again, just disable and leave it disabled, until you've seen someone in reference to the problem.

Twitter. It's not just for making pithy jokes or chronicling every episode of Game of Thrones. Twitter's ""re-tweet"" function allows you to keep track of your favorite links, articles, videos, and pictures. With a user-base that is more than 300 million strong, it also provides an excellent branding platform for your business.Reddit. Reddit's structure of sub-reddits (or sub-categories) takes tagged key words and turns them into on-line forums. Here, you can post links in the key word's corresponding sub-reddit and get up votes by community members. The web site design is very bare bones and sometimes clunky to navigate, but if you just need a place to find links based on common interests, this should fit the bill.
Pinterest. Are you driven by images? Then Pinterest is the place for you. Here you can ""pin"" links for just about anything -- new recipes, exercise tips, tech articles, wedding inspiration, etc. Although Pinterest might appear to be exclusively for women, more than 1/3 of its users are men.StumbleUpon. StumbleUpon is a website purely designed for liking and share links. When you register an account with them, you can choose general areas of interest, and then the web site will present different links for you to ""stumble upon"" and read.
Delicious. The grand dame of social bookmarking, Delicious is currently undergoing a reboot to make it easier to integrate links across social media platforms. Because Delicious has had such a long-standing presence in the social bookmarking scene, many users are still loyal to it.;
, The particular methods for doing this will vary from site to site, but you will most likely need to cut and paste the link you want to bookmark into an ""upload"" forum on your profile on the site.


To copy, right click on the link's address in your browser. Select the ""copy"" option from the menu of options that will appear. Then, return to your social bookmarking site and right click again; select the ""paste"" option this time. This will put the link into the forum where you can upload a link. You will then need to hit an ""upload"" or ""post"" button on the site.
Consult the tutorial section of the social bookmarking site if you have questions about how to upload content to it.

, You might find it easier to link your Facebook or Google+ profiles to your social bookmarking site; that way, you will have one central, easy way for logging in and keeping track of your interests.

, As you upload bookmarks to any of the above sites, be sure to ""tag"" the link with some key words that will help other users find it. What 2-3 words come to mind when you think of this link? What search words did you use to find the link?

, If you find most of your bookmarks on a desktop browser, then be sure to download the extension that these websites. Whenever you see a page you wish to bookmark, you just click the extension and easily add it to your profile on the site.

, Social bookmarking can't directly increase the Google rank of your business's web site. However, key words related to your business can land on Google's search results when they appear on popular social bookmarking sites which do have high Google rankings, like Reddit, Twitter and Pinterest.Offer discounts and special user codes through social bookmarking sites to drive traffic to your web site. Upload the link for the page on your web site or blog that you want to readers to visit to one of these social bookmarking sites. Use popular key words to tag your links. Often, social bookmarking sites will tell you which key words are ""trending"" (as on Twitter) or what word is a particularly popular search at that moment. Consider how you can tag your business's account with popular key words. This will help drive more traffic to your site.
Amass followers by being active on these sites. Retweet or pin items that you find to be popular from other users. If you are an active user on the site, then more activity will come to your own account.
If you think of social bookmarking sites as a helpful PR tool, then you can use them to raise awareness about your product to your target audience.

, Many social bookmarking sites have become fertile ground for digital marketing. While it is fine to promote your own content on most of these sites, be careful not to flood users' feeds simply to drive traffic to your site.


Remember that it is in your business's interest to be a trustworthy and valuable member of the community.

, If you are using a social bookmarking platform for marketing, it is especially important that you engage with the content of other users. Pin, retweet, and link to content that you find to be engaging and important.


Not only will this help you make valuable connections, it will also give your potential customers a better sense of who you are and what drives your business.

, Many bookmarking sites leave less room for hostile flame wars than other social media sites. But you should still be considerate. While you might want to engage in a lively debate with other users of the site, try to keep the tone cordial and respectful.


Remember that tags and keys words are there to help connect users, not divide them.

, When social bookmarking originated circa 2003, it provided a public alternative to private bookmarks that you could organize in your browser. Websites like Delicious provided a space where you could collect links and tag them under common interests.


Today, social bookmarking is much more interactive than when it first began, with digital communities like Digg, Reddit, Pinterest and Twitter providing millions of users a space to share common interests, bounce ideas off of each other, and gain inspiration from the community., When social bookmarking was first designed, users would ""tag"" links according to key words of interest. These key words together became known as ""folksonomies,""or a collection of vocabulary that users could assign to particular links. Searching the ""folksonomy"" of a bookmarking site can help organize your information., Websites like Pinterest and Twitter are designed with the mobile end-user in mind. If you want a central place where all your favorite links on music, food, technology, etc. are easily stored, then social bookmarking is designed with your needs in mind.

You might get a low result because your connection is being used by other programs. This does not mean that your connection speed is slower, just that the speed test is not able to connect to your computer with a strong connection. You may want to consider closing other programs that are using the Internet.
You may experience a slower connection speed temporarily if your Internet service provider is performing scheduled maintenance work.
The servers might be busy for the website that you are trying to perform the speed test through. This does not mean that you have a slower connection; it means that the website was not able to perform the test as quickly as it should have.

Visit an open source repository.,
Look for a program that does what you need.,
Download the program from the developer.",How to Legally Download Software Online1," Open source programs are community-driven projects where the code of the program is available to anyone. This means that typically, open source software is completely free to use and copy. These projects are often iterated on by community members, meaning they are constantly evolving. There are several major open source repositories that host a variety of applications available for free download:


SourceForge
Google Code
GitHub
CodePlex;
, Most open source programs work as replacements for paid programs. For example, OpenOffice will perform many of the same functions as Microsoft Office, and can read and edit most Microsoft Office files.


Not all open source software is free. Developers can take an open source project, add special functions, and then charge for it.

, Only download open source projects directly from the developer. This will ensure that you get the code straight from the people who developed it, and it has not been repackaged with malware.

Be aware of dangerous email attachments.,
Download files safely from websites.,
Validate the digital signature.,
Submit your file to an online validation.",How to Know What Not to Download1," Anything can be attached to an email—including harmful downloads. Look for some common warning signs to help keep your computer protected. Watch for dangerous document extensions. Some common harmful extensions passed through email attachments are .js, .vbs, .msi, and .reg. Most email services block these files, but check before you download attachments.
Pay close attention to office files. Office file extensions that end with m contain macros and these are potentially dangerous. Although some businesses use macro-enabled documents, be conscious of extensions such as: .docm, .xlsm, and .pptm,
Know the common safe extensions. In general, it is ok to trust .pdf, .pptx, .docx, .xlsx, .jpg, and .png. ;
, Look over the site that you’re downloading from. If the site has been in existence and is backed by a valid organization, chances are it’s trustworthy.


Files that carry viruses are dangerous. The main file types to avoid are files with extensions such as .exe, .scr, .bat, .com, or .pif. Hackers trick people easily with double extension files. For example, if a file ends in .exe.gif or .bat.scr, do not download it! These double extensions are often a virus or torrent.

, If the signature is valid, the file is more likely to be trusted.


The digital signature is a technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software, or digital document. It ensures security and assurance of evidence to origin. To see the digital signature, click the publisher link in the security dialog box that Internet Explorer displays when you first download the file. This will tell you if the signature is valid.

, Even if you trust the site, file, and digital signature, use an online service, like VirusTotal, to scan your file.


Right click your file’s link, and select “Copy link address”
Go to VirusTotal.com and select “Submit a URL”
Paste the your link in the text field and click “Submit URL”
Click “View downloaded file analysis”
If nothing was detected, you can assume that the file is safe and fine to use. If something was malicious within the file, the site will warn you.

Browse freeware hosting sites.,
Download the program from a reputable host, or directly from the developer.",How to Legally Download Software Online2," Freeware are free programs that anyone can download and install without paying. Some are open source, and some are “lite” versions of paid products. Many freeware projects are created by dedicated community members and enthusiasts.


Always read the privacy policies and terms of service for freeware products. Ensure that your private data is not being used for marketing or tracking purposes.

, There are a large number of freeware hosting sites that can give you download links for the software you want. Try to check the developer’s page to make sure that you are getting the latest version.

"
"
Search for the product you want to try.,
Decide if the product is worth buying.",How to Legally Download Software Online3," Most major products (usually excluding games) are available on a trial basis. These are typically 30- or 60-day trials, where you can use most or all of the programs features. After the trial period is over, you will be asked to purchase the product before you continue using it.


Most developers will provide a trial version directly from their websites. You may need to register with the company in order to download the trial.

, Once you’ve started using the trial software, determine if the software suits your needs and if it is worth your money. Check around for freeware or open source alternatives; professional software can get very expensive.

Turn off file sharing.,
Avoid illegal activity.,
Use safe programs.",How to Know What Not to Download2," Many programs that lead to illegal downloads are Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and use file sharing to make songs on one computer available to another. Disabling file sharing will save your computer from these harmful downloads with potential viruses. To disable file sharing, follow these steps:


Click Start, My Computer
Go into Tools
Choose Folder Options
Click View
In Advanced Settings, click Use Simple File Sharing to clear the check box
Click OK , Downloading files that you haven’t paid for without the permission of the copyright holder is illegal. This happens mostly through P2P software. The most popular examples of P2P software are:


Limewire
Kazaa
Bearshare
BitTorrent
Ares

, Using the P2P software not only puts your computer at danger, but also puts you in line for potential fine and jail times. It is illegal to download without permission of the copyright holder. These programs allow you to legally download music:


Ruckus
iTunes
eMusic
Amazon
Napster

"
"
Do not trust groups.,
Use legal game downloading programs.,
Use legal movie downloading programs.,
Know what you buy.",How to Know What Not to Download3," Although groups used to release software just to show off that they had hacked the encryption of a game, it has now become a scene of spammers, virus creators, and people who will steal your information and empty your bank account before you get an hour into your game.


When you trust a P2P network, you are giving up all of the information in your computer to a hacker that has exceptional technological skill. This hacker can easily get into any details on your computer, making it easy to steal your bank account information, or anything else you may have stored. It doesn’t matter how often you play the game or watch the video. Just downloading it from a P2P network gives these hackers free reign of your information. Along with the download comes the installation of a keylogger, trojan, or root kit, and that is what gives them access. , Although games are going to still run you more than a couple bucks, downloading them gives you some freedoms. For example, you can do so from home, and you’ll have the ability to re-download it if anything happens. Use some of these safe programs to download games: GameFly
GameTap
EA Store
GamersGate

, Just as with downloading games, you will need to pay for these downloads. The fees, however, are typically smaller than if you were to buy a DVD. Use the following safe programs to avoid harmful downloads:


Amazon
Netflix
Love Film
Redbox Instant
Crackle.com
Vongo

, Just because you pay for a video download, doesn’t make it legal. The programs previously listed are trusted, however there are many more programs available. Just because they require you to pay, doesn’t mean they are trusted. Avoid torrents. Torrent files are often bootleg or pirated and, therefore, illegal. Even though these programs are set up for an easy download, they will most likely add viruses or allow a hacker into your computer.
Entertainment companies often link placebo files to these downloads. These are intended to frustrate users and dissuade you from using the sites that don’t have proper copyright holders.

Determine whether you want closed- or open-ended questions on the email survey.,
Place questions on the survey that are guaranteed to elicit responses from your audience.",How to Create an Email Survey1," Closed-ended questions can provide you with specific answers such as ""yes"" or ""no;"" whereas open-ended questions will often require your audience to answer each question using their own words or explanation.


Use a dichotomous survey if you just want to ask questions that require a ""yes"" or ""no"" response.
Use a multiple choice format if you want to provide a series of possible answers to your survey takers.
Use importance, likert, rating, or bipolar survey styles if you want your audience to rank items on a pre-determined scale. For example, a ""likert"" survey will require participants to either ""strongly disagree,"" ""disagree,"" ""agree,"" ""strongly agree,"" or remain neutral in regards to a particular question.
Use a qualitative survey if you want to ask participants a series of open-ended questions. An example of an open-ended question is: ""What will you tell your friends and family about our products?"";
, This will encourage all participants to complete the survey in full. For example, ask whether the participant enjoyed using your product, as opposed to asking what they think about a specific product they may not have used.


Use questions that will not inconvenience the customer in any way. An example of an inconvenient question is asking your customer to enter a product number from a product's label that they may no longer have in their possession.
Be sure to include questions on the survey that will benefit your market research or business initiatives. For example, if you want to know how many people between the ages of 20 and 30 years used your product, require participants to indicate their age on the survey.

Microsoft accounts allow you to access Outlook, SkyDrive, Office 365 (with subscription), and create an Xbox gamertag.
iCloud mail comes free with an Apple ID, and allows you to send and receive emails using aliases to protect your email address.
Yahoo! accounts allow you to create a custom homepage, which you can link with your Facebook account.;
, Most free email accounts come with a limited amount of storage space. While the free amount is typically more than enough for the average personal use, business users may find that the storage is insufficient for high-volumes of emails.


Most free email services can be upgraded with more storage for monthly payments. The extra storage will apply to all related services. For example, buying extra storage for Gmail will increase your Drive storage as well.

, Most internet service providers offer multiple email accounts with your internet package. These can often be accessed through the provider’s home page. Using one of these accounts may be more appealing than setting up a new one, as you are already paying for it with your internet subscription.


If you feel like you might change service providers frequently, avoid using their email addresses for anything important You may lose easy access if you change service providers. , When you register with a web hosting service, you often receive email accounts that include your domain name. This is especially useful for small business owners, as it allows your email to seem more professional, as opposed to sending email from a free service.

Consider purchasing the unprotected versions.,
Avoid music conversion software that claims to remove DRM.,
Insert a blank CD into your computer.,
Find your protected music in iTunes.,
Create a playlist in iTunes with the protected music you want to convert.,
Right-click on the first playlist and select ""Burn Playlist to Disc."",
Ensure ""Audio CD"" is selected and click ""Burn."",
Open the iTunes Preferences menu.,
Click ""Import Settings"" and set your MP3 options.,
Click the ""CD"" button at the top of the iTunes window.,
Start importing the CD.,
Format your CD-RW and burn the next playlist (CD-RW only).",How to Convert Protected Audio Into a Plain MP31," Apple no longer sells music that's protected by DRM, but songs purchased before 2009 are likely still protected. With an iTunes Match subscription, you can update all of these files to their unprotected versions, or you can repurchase individual songs and albums.


Once you've repurchased the unprotected copies, delete the files from your iTunes library and download them again.;
, These are mostly adware and often come packaged with unwanted programs. They also very rarely work and usually just re-record your songs, since DRM cannot be cracked.

, If you don't want to repurchase your old music, you can remove the protection by burning it to a CD and then ripping it back to MP3 format. You can do this entirely in iTunes. There are a few caveats:


You'll need to be authorized to play the protected M4P files in iTunes in the first place in order to burn it to a CD.
There will be a small drop in quality.
You'll want to use a CD-RW if possible if you have a lot of files to convert, otherwise you'll need a lot of blank CD-Rs. You can reuse a CD-RW up to 1000 times, which can be a lifesaver for large libraries.

, iTunes' default settings will not tell you which of your songs are protected. You can see which of your songs are protected by adding the ""Kind"" column to your music list:


Open the Music section in iTunes and select your Music library. This will display a list of all of your songs.
Right-click the columns at the top of the list and select ""Kind.""
Click the ""Kind"" column to sort your music by file format. All of your protected songs will display ""Protected AAC Audio File"" in the ""Kind"" column.

, To burn a CD in iTunes, you'll need to create a playlist with the tracks you want to burn first.


Select 80 minutes of your protected music files. While you can set iTunes to burn multiple CDs in a row, only one of the CDs will retain artist and song information. Creating individual playlists for each CD will ensure that the song information stays intact. You'll also need to do one playlist at a time if you're using a CD-RW.
Right-click the selection and select ""New Playlist from Selection."" Name your new playlist whatever you'd like.
Repeat for any additional protected songs until you have multiple 80 minute playlists. Make sure none of the playlists go over 80 minutes, or you won't be able to burn them.

, This will open the Burn Settings window.If you are informed that your computer is not authorized to burn the songs, double-click the song in your iTunes playlist and then enter the Apple ID and password used to purchase it.
You cannot burn playlists containing songs that have been burned already more than seven times. If you've burned your songs to CD more than seven times in the past, you won't be able to convert it this way. See the last section of this article for a workaround.

, iTunes will begin burning the songs to CD, which will take a few minutes to complete.


If you're using multiple CD-Rs to burn a lot of songs, you can continue to burn them to discs. If you're using a CD-RW, proceed with the rest of the steps to rip them, then format the disc and burn the next playlist.

, After burning your CDs, you'll need to set iTunes to import CD tracks as high-quality MP3 files. You can do this from the iTunes Preferences menu.


Windows - Press Alt and click the Edit menu. Select ""Preferences.""
Mac - Click the iTunes menu and select ""Preferences.""

, Use the following settings to get high-quality MP3 files when you rip from your burned CDs:


Select ""MP3 Encoder"" from the ""Import Using"" menu.
Select ""Custom"" from the ""Setting"" menu.
Set ""Stereo Bit Rate"" to ""320 kbps.""
Check the ""Use Variable Bit Rate Encoding (VBR)"" box and set ""Quality"" to ""Highest.""

, This will open the CD that is currently inserted in the computer.

, Click ""Yes"" when prompted to begin importing the songs. This will take a few minutes to complete. Once the import process is complete, you'll have the new unprotected MP3s in your iTunes library.Because you still have the protected songs in your library still, you'll likely have duplicates. Use the ""Kind"" column to make the distinction between the two and remove the protected files.

, If you're using a single CD-RW to convert your files, you'll need to format it after importing the songs into iTunes so that you can burn the next playlist to it:


Right-click on your CD-RW in Windows Explorer ⊞ Win+E or Finder and select ""Format.""
After the disc has been formatted, burn the next playlist to it and then import it into iTunes following the instructions above. Repeat as many times as necessary.

Avoid programs that claim to remove DRM. Since it is not possible to crack the DRM that's in place, most programs don't work. Instead, they often come bundled with adware that you don't want.

, By burning the music to a disc and then ripping it, you'll be able to remove the DRM on it. A CD-RW is recommended for large libraries of protected music, since you can reuse it many times.

, If you aren't already in Library view, you can enter it by pressing Ctrl+1.

, This will display the burn list.

, You'll only be able to burn 80 minutes of music at a time (less for some CDs).

, Windows Media Player will begin burning the songs to the CD. This may take several minutes to complete.


If you are unable to burn the songs due to the DRM restrictions, see the next section instead.

, You can change Windows Media Player's CD ripper settings so that ripped songs are automatically converted to MP3 format, saving you a few steps:


Press Alt and click ""Tool"" → ""Options.""
Click the ""Rip Music"" tab.
Select ""MP3"" from the ""Format"" menu.
Drag the ""Audio quality"" slider all of the way to the right. Click ""Apply"" to save your changes.

, After the CD finishes burning, it may auto-eject. Reinsert it and then click the ""Rip CD"" to begin copying the music back to your computer.

, Windows Media Player will begin extracting the audio from the CD and converting the files to MP3 format. You'll be able to find these files in your ""Music"" folder. The MP3 files will not have any DRM protection.

This is the most time-consuming process, but will work for every file. In order to do this, you'll need Audacity, which is a free, opensource audio recorder and editor.


You can download Audacity from audacityteam.org. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

, Audacity does not come with the ability to save as MP3 until you install an MP3 encoder. LAME is the most popular one, and Audacity is designed to automatically detect it when it is installed in the default location:


Download LAME from lame.buanzo.org. Make sure to download the correct installer for your operating system.
Run the installer and follow all of the prompts to install LAME. Do not change any of the default installation locations so that Audacity can detect it automatically.

, If you're using a Mac, you'll need a free utility called Soundflower that will allow you to record the audio that your Mac outputs:Download Soundflower from github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases/. Download the Soundflower-2.0b2.dmg file.
Double-click the DMG file, then double-click the PKG file. This will install Soundflower. You may need to right-click the PKG file and select ""Open"" if you receive a warning.
Click the Apple menu and select ""System Preferences."" Open the Sound menu.
Select ""Soundflower (2ch)"" in both the Output and the Input tab. Make sure both volumes are turned up. You will no longer hear sound from your speakers, as it is being routed through Soundflower. This will allow Audacity to capture it.

, You'll see the track timeline as well as the playback and recording controls.

, Use the drop-down menus to the left and right of the microphone to set your recording source:


Windows - Select ""Windows WASAPI"" from the first menu, then ""Speakers (Manufacturer) (loopback)"" from the second menu.Mac - Select ""Core Audio"" from the first menu, then ""Soundflower (2 ch)"" from the second menu.

, Use the drop-down menu on the far right to set your output device:


Windows - Select ""Speakers"" or ""Headphones.""
Mac - Select ""Built-in Output.""

, Audacity usually cannot start recording unless there is audio playing. Start playing a junk track so that you can begin recording.

, Audacity will begin recording the song as it plays.

, once the track has finished playing, click Stop. You can then make any necessary edits, such as removing the bit of junk at the beginning before you started the song. Once you're ready, you can export the file as an unprotected MP3:


Click ""File"" or ""Audacity"" and select ""Export Audio.""
Select ""MP3 Files"" from the ""Save as type"" menu.
Choose your quality settings. Higher quality will result in a larger file.
Give the file a name and choose where to save it. You now have an unprotected MP3 copy of your original file.

Download music on a peer-to-peer network.",How to Download Music1," Visit http://www.youtube-mp3.org/ to find a simple interface for pulling audio files from YouTube videos and saving them as MP3s. This is a simple way to get songs you want quickly, though it has some drawbacks: the quality of your MP3 files will be fairly low, and the quality of the sound can't be improved if it was already poor on the YouTube video itself. Additionally, any empty space or non-musical parts of a video will also be ripped. However, the process is very easy: just paste the URL of the video you want into the text box and click “Convert Video.”


This site and others like it exist in a legal limbo of sorts. The service itself may or may not be entirely legal, but your chances of getting in trouble from using it are slim to none.;
, If you join an online community of music enthusiasts at a site without many restrictions on content, you may find the occasional discussion topic centered around sharing albums for free. These albums usually come with the personal recommendation of one or more other users, so they're a great way to explore new genres or artists without having to sift through a lot of chaff. The most common way they're shared is by direct download.


Typically, one user will post a compressed file containing an entire album to a file hosting site such as Mega, Mediafire, or Zippyshare. He or she will then post a link to the download, along with a description of the music, and a YouTube sample, if there's one available. All you need to do to download the music is visit the address that user provided and click “download.”
Be wary of viruses and (more commonly) mislabeled albums. If you ask for a high-profile new release and someone posts it immediately, it may very well be that you'll download the album only to find it's full of irritating novelty songs. Always keep your antivirus program on when directly downloading files, and be prepared to roll with the occasional practical joke.
Direct downloads are also the most common way to get music from music blogs. Be aware that over time, download links on music blogs tend to “die” as they're policed by file hosting sites and removed.

, One of the most popular ways to get music is through torrenting. To torrent music, you need a program that can read torrent files, and the proper torrent file for the music you want to download. Torrent files themselves only contain directions on which files to download, so they're not illegal per se; you can find many torrents simply by performing a web search. There are also special torrenting communities like What.CD that offer vast private collections of music that's sometimes unavailable anywhere else, but entry into these communities is strictly controlled. Most people will have to make do with general torrent libraries.


Once you download the torrent file, it should open automatically in your torrent program. If there are enough seeders (people sharing the album), your copy should download quickly. Check to be sure you know where your torrents download so that you don't lose track of any of them.






Outside of private torrenting communities, torrenting music is better for acquiring older and more mainstream releases than for newer and underground releases.
Once your torrent finishes downloading, it's considered polite to become a seeder yourself by leaving the program running. You don't have to if you don't want to, but it does help other users get the music more quickly and easily.







, Peer-to-peer networks require a special program to interface with. Many of the most popular ones, such as Limewire, share the GNU network; among these, your only real concern is choosing the program whose interface you like the best (as the files being shared are identical across all of them). There are also programs that run on separate peer-to-peer networks, such as Soulseek. Since you're snagging files directly from other users' hard drives, you'll need to wait until someone with the music you want is online before you can get it; however, this isn't usually a problem as peer-to-peer file sharing is very popular.


Soulseek in particular is an excellent place to find all sorts of music files. It can even rival the selection of private torrent communities like What.CD at times. To download most music on Soulseek, you'll need to share some or all of your own music collection with its users in return.
Depending on the client you use, peer-to-peer file downloading can be dangerous. Always check the file extension to be sure it's actually a music file before you download it, and check the file size to see if it's reasonable for the length and recording quality of the song. Soulseek, with its heavy emphasis on music, is relatively safe in this regard, but you should be wary no matter which network you use.

Pay and download.",How to Download Music2," Apple's iTunes Store and Amazon.com are the mos popular places to purchase and download music online. Both services make signing up easy. Once you've made a free account and provided payment information, you're free to browse their collections. Amazon.com boasts over 20 million songs available to purchase, while iTunes' exclusive contracts and slick interface make it a great choice for new and up-and-coming bands in particular.


In addition to these sites, there are various other, smaller purveyors of digital music downloads. Feel free to browse these if you like, but remember: if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Amazon and Apple are good choices in large part because they're trustworthy.

, Both Amazon.com and the iTunes Store regularly offer sales on whole albums or individual songs. You can often find collections of older music (such as classical music recordings) for pennies per track, or interesting albums from artists you'd never have heard of otherwise.


Take advantage of previews before downloading new music. Check to be sure that the sound of the songs is pleasant enough to warrant spending a few dollars on the album.
If you really can't decide, you can sometimes use YouTube to look up an artist and hear whole songs before you buy. Streaming services like Spotify can also provide you with this option.

, As long as you're logged in, paying for your music is very easy: just click to download the tracks you want (or the entire album, which is usually cheaper than buying each track separately) and confirm payment. As soon as you do, the music will download very quickly onto your computer, at which point you can play it wherever and however loud you like for the rest of your life.


Apple in particular has made some ill-fated forays into digital rights management (DRM), which in plain English means technology to limit your use of the music you download. They don't have a strict DRM policy these days, but be wary of possible changes in the future.
iTunes music files typically download in M4A (MPEG-4 Audio) format, whereas Amazon files download as high-quality MP3 tracks instead. You may have options to change the file type before you download if you want; M4A files aren't as popular with audiophiles as lossless MP3 files are.

At MP3.com, simply hover your pointer over “Free Music” at the top of the page and select a genre you're interested in. These sites tend towards obscure and little-known artists, but occasionally feature more popular acts.


DatPiff.com is a site for hip-hop mixtapes, which are whole albums or EPs made by remixing preexisting back beats and samples, and then rapping over them. DatPiff allows its users five free downloads per day, not counting special promotional downloads. The community there is very active, so it's easy to find highly-rated mixtapes from talented up-and-coming rappers and producers.
Jamendo.com is a site that features music exclusively released for free by independent artists. It's a wide mix of sounds that tends towards mainstream genres like folk, rock, and pop. The site runs very slowly, but there's tens of thousands of songs available completely for free, making it a great choice for a foray into new and unknown music.

, Keep your eyes peeled on Amazon.com and the iTunes Store for free music, as well. Both services periodically provide free tracks, and occasionally even free albums. These tend to be fairly obscure, but at the price they're asking, you might as well take a chance.


Sometimes, these services will also run member promotions allowing you a few dollars of MP3 credit at no cost, which you can spend on whatever songs you want. Keep an ear to the ground; such promotions don't happen often.

, Many bands maintain an active online presence to cater to their fans and promote merchandise, upcoming tours, and other such things. Visit the websites of bands you love and join their communities by signing up for e-mail updates, becoming a fan on Facebook, and so on. Periodically, you'll get access to bonus tracks, demo tracks, and live session recordings for free!


Use a service like Last.fm or Pandora to find artists similar to ones you like, and become a fan of those artists, as well. If you follow enough of them, you could be snagging great, new, free music on a weekly basis.

, There are a few free, nonprofit sites on the Internet that provide totally legal free music simply for the public good. These sites feature a lot of music across all different genres, including artists you've heard of and many you haven't yet. They're a great way to safely and securely find new music or fill in your collection of a favorite artist with rare live tracks and other cuts.



Free Music Archive is a new site that aims to collect all publicly released free music under one roof. It hosts growing collections from the likes of indie radio giant KEXP (which posts all of its live session tracks), and WFMU New Jersey, the country's longest-running free form radio station, which has uploaded over 20,000 tracks to the archive to date.

The Internet Archive is a massive collection that aims to record all of the information ever posted on the Internet. Its Audio section features thousands upon thousands of completely free tracks from both the past and the present.

Start attaching artwork.,
Before doing this you will first need to go into ""my computer"" then the file ""my pictures"" then right click and select ""new folder"" Name this folder, ""my album artwork."",
Once you have this folder created and ready for use, browse the internet to find the album artwork or your specific song.,
Notice that by making these changes in iTunes, the original mp3 files are also changed.,
You are now finished!",How to Attach Artwork to MP3 Music Tracks," You'll find that sometimes a song will have the artwork already attached and sometimes not and this depends mostly on it's original source or format.;
,, Usually upon plugging your mp3 into the computer a window will pop up asking what you would like to do. If this happens then click ""open folder to view files."" If this does not happen then you will have to open ""my computer"" and look for your device under ""devices with removable storage""

, (this creates a copy of the music file onto the computer)

, (A new playlist is created by selecting ""File"" then ""New Playlist"")

,, With this list of music on the iTunes playlist, you are now ready to attach your album artwork. This must be done one song, or one album at a time.


Select the song you wish to work with and right-click it.
Select ""Get info"" then click the tab that says ""Artwork."" If the song already has an artwork attached you will see it there. If not, then press ""Add"" and you can then browse your entire computer to attach any image you like.


Remember that if you do not have the album artwork on file in your computer (which is almost always the case) then you will need to go and find it first and the best way to do this through the internet.

,

, One such place to find them is www.amazonmp3.com or the search engine Google images are very useful. Once you find the picture you wish to attach, right click the image and select ""save picture as."" then save the picture in the new folder you have created which is under ""my pictures; my album artwork"" once the song's image is saved in that file you may then go back to iTunes and by clicking ""add"" you can look for and browse through your ""my album artwork"" folder to select that picture and it will then be added to the mp3 file as an attachment.

, This means that the songs you initially copied onto the new folder on the desktop in the beginning are also changed. Once you make all the album artwork modifications to each song you want then you simply take those files from that new folder on your desktop and re-copy them to your mp3 player. A window will pop up telling you that your device already contains a file with the same name and when that happens, click ""replace."" This means that the old music files on your mp3 player that don't have artwork attachments will be replaced with the new files that you have just modified to contain album artwork.

, Don't be surprised if it takes a moment or two for your mp3 player to recognize the new album artwork changes. This is especially common with cell phones and it has to do with the processor.

Understand that MP3 is a great way to discover new artists and their music.,
Understand that no MP3 - bought or downloaded from obscure source - can replace an original album.,
Understand that these artists often try to make a living out of their art.,
Figure what style of music you prefer for a starting point.,
When downloading music always try to get full albums, unless one track is good and the rest is utter crap, in that case you might very well be able to find a single release (see external links).

,
Try to avoid P2P software (Kazaa, Limewire and such) for serious collecting and research.,
Find a few good resources that serve your music likings (find some ftp or kdx servers, find torrent trackers, connect to channels over IRC, EFNet… and communicate with the ""locals"" on the hows and wheres).

,
You will find quite soon that many servers require that you contribute in order to download.,
Always be kind to admins and moderators.,
At this point you will get quality MP3s to which you will listen and probably enjoy: step 1 is in action, that's also when step 2 should kick in.

,
It's normal to have a lot more MP3s than CDs, you will not buy all of what you've listened to.,The circle is joined, you are a collector of MP3s who will soon turn out to also be a CD collector.",How to Become a Conscientious MP3 Collector,";
, The artwork, photography, design, inserts, CD enhancements etc. are part of the experience the artist wanted to share with you.

, If you like this artist/group or that album very much then please support them (see their shows, buy their CDs and merchandise); they will be good to you by making more of that which you liked.

, You'll get to explore from there.

,, Quality is often inconsistent, making it hard to have a consistent album. Instead use torrent clients to download entire albums. uTorrent is a good choice, especially the stand alone version.

,, If you rip your own CDs and intend to upload them, please read about how to make quality rips (see external links). People serve you good quality files, return the favor.

, You will gain nothing from being rude. And always finish your uploads. We'll call this basic etiquette.

,, But you are - again - obliged to buy those you really like and listen to on a regular basis.

Rename the MP3 if necessary.,
Upload the MP3 on the Internet so others can access it.,

Add the hyperlink code within the HTML of the webpage where you want others to see the download link.

,
Open your website, browse to the download link and click on it to make sure that it is working correctly.

",How to Create a Download Link for MP3," Most MP3 files that are downloaded from the Internet already have appropriate names since they were being used for download links. However, you should still check the name to make sure it meets the following criteria.


Keep the name of the MP3 file short. To do this you can just keep the main keywords in the filename and remove common words such as ""and,"" ""it"" and ""the.""
The filename should reflect the name of the song or audio in the MP3 file. In general, try to use the title of the song and perhaps the name of the artist when you are renaming the file.
The MP3 file's name should not have any capitalization, spaces or punctuation marks because they are not recognized in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). If you use any of these grammatical elements you will end up with a broken hyperlink code when you create a download link for MP3 sharing purposes, and people will not be able to download the MP3.;
, You should be able to upload MP3 files on your website server using the same method that you had used to upload HTML files (web pages) for your website. The MP3 should be uploaded as a public file so anybody can access it.

, This is known as the link URL or destination URL (the destination where the MP3 is located) and can be seen using 1 of the following methods.


Right-click on the preview link of the MP3 file and copy the link location.
Open your website homepage which should be located on your domain URL. Add the complete filename of the MP3 file including the file extension at the end of the domain URL and copy the complete URL (domain address with the filename at the end).

, Use the following code ""<a href=""Link%20URL"">Link Text</a>"" and replace ""Link URL"" with the URL for the MP3 file and changing ""Link Text"" to the text that you want to appear for the link.

Your name
Business/Company Name and/or logo
Email address
Website address
Telephone and mobile number

Other additional elements could be:
Social media links like Linkedin, Facebook, twitter
Disclaimer (if required)
Tag line describing your business and service offerings

;
, As an individual or a business, you will be using your signature for external promotions, legal protection (the disclaimers) and communicating internal information to staff. Some might prefer a simple signature, while others rely heavily on images. A typical signature has a mixture of two types of content:



Information. The basic details that fall into this category of information are:

Sender’s name
Job title
Contact details (telephone, mobile, email address)



Imagery. The aesthetic aspect of the signature. This includes:

Logo
Social media buttons
RSS feeds
Other ways you've maintained an online presence



, When composing your signature on a professional note, it is recommended to keep a minimalist approach. This is adequate for most business needs. You should not assume that if your email signature has more contact details, you'll be more likely to be contacted. In many situations, an email and telephone number will suffice.


A minimalist approach is considered professional since it enables the reader to quickly get back to you via your email or number instead of taking time to decide from a long list of contact details. It is equivalent to hitting the bull’s eye in terms of approaching you.
Keeping everything to a minimum dictates that these contact options are those which you most frequently use. The recipient of your email will not have any issues as to your unavailability when they contact you.

, Though ultimately the format of your signature is up to you, there are basic guidelines you should follow to make it easy to scan and seem professional. Here are a few things to keep in mind:


Put your company logo above your slogan on the left, if applicable.
On the right, put your first and last name.
Below your name on the right, add the following in this order:

Phone
Mobile
Email
Website
Social networking icons (in a row)



, Your entire organization should be following one standard format to communicate a consistent personality of the business, whether your organization is 1000 people or just you. What devices use your signature? Make sure they all represent you the same.


Ensure that consistency is achieved over all your devices including smart phones or any other device or client. This can be done through using software to manage your signature and through applying updates on every device for every user.
Vary branding between departments, if applicable. A variation in signature for sales and customer service departments may exist but the main details will stay uniform. For example, a specific department may have their own slogans or service offerings, though they may use the same logo, etc.

, Some people may benefit from your Twitter, Facebook, and other superfluous information while others will want to get down to the brass tacks of your phone number and email. Just make sure the important information, like your name and email, are still front and center.


When the graphical elements of your signature stand out more than the actual details, the recipient, instead of being informed, gets overwhelmed due to the high degree of unnecessary overtones. This undermines your credibility, putting a negative spin on your method of information exchange, making you seem unprofessional. Keep it appropriate for the audience you're trying to reach.

, A number of software solutions are available in the market that allow you to create your email signature in a highly professional manner. However, the right solution totally depends on your preferences. Here's a list of software extensions, utilities and add-ons for Microsoft Exchange servers that are available:


CodeTwo Exchange Rules
Exclaimer Signature Manager Outlook Edition
Symprex Email Signature Manager
Exclaimer Mail Disclaimers
Red Earth Software

Furthermore, in case you have an on-premise Microsoft Exchange Server (2003, 2007, 2010, 2013), Policy Patrol Disclaimers is a good option. mySignaturesOnline or Policy Patrol Signatures works well for hosted email systems like Office 365, Google Apps or hosted Exchange.



, The first step, regardless of program, is entering your contact details. This pertains only to the contact details that should appear on your email signature. This is a detailed list that may include a number of options like your company name, official address, telephone, fax and website link etc.


You can choose to show or hide each field.
Save the entries to proceed to the next step.

, If you would like to include social networks in your signature, this step allows you to add the URL paths or links that you want to be accessed in your signature. Likewise, you can choose to hide or show the field.


This step also allows you to select the color of the icon and its size for a wide range of networks like Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.
Be sure to hit save and proceed to the next step.

, This refers to the message you may intend to add into your signature like a disclaimer, any privacy entry or something like ""going green,"" for instance. Similarly, save and click on the next tab.

, You can choose from the available options and go for a template, font size, text size, base color, etc. Click save and then hit the next button.


In certain cases, you'll be able to have more of a hands-on approach to your signature and create your own template. Just remember to keep it simple.

, This is the final step which allows you to add an image to your email signature. This usually supports multiple image extensions, including jpeg, png, gif, etc. Upload an image from your computer for this purpose.


Once you are done with this step, you get an option to download your email signature file which will then be ready for use.

, There's a fine line between lively colors and colors that are, well, obnoxious. It should not be distracting, aggressive or over-toned to the extent of aggravating the eye. Here's what to keep in mind:


For RGB values, avoid using pure colors – a single color not combined with any other color. These hues are too sharp for an email signature. The brighter the colors are, the more aggravating they appear to the naked eye.
Keep saturation at a range of 100-150 when brightness falls around 15-40. This works well for the color display of both computer screens and smart phones.
When using a primary color, support it with a varying tone of the same color to make it visually appealing and to put it in alignment with the white background of your email.
Avoid certain colors that change hue across screens. Gold looks khaki on certain monitors, darkest reds appear muddy and pastel green and yellow appear tinted.
Use software to quickly test and compare the slightest changes in color. A merely simple standalone signature with its own color may seem good but you must check it against the white plain background of the email.

, There are many reasons to keep your signature on the small side: the resolution of the image you are using might not open with certain mail clients, the quality of an image is lost if it’s shrunk to fit the size of the email body, and simply enough, large images take longer to load. You want a signature size that works across email clients.


Scale your signature so that it fits the size of the viewing window. This implies your signature is rightly sized to suit the size of your computer screen or phone’s display. This can be done by scaling the image through using an HTML “Width = 100%” or similar code.

, Images behind text rarely work in email. Yahoo supports background images whereas some standard other clients like Gmail, Outlook or Hotmail, don’t render them properly. Background colors do give your email a personality – only if they are not overwhelming. Here's what you need to know about background color:



Avoid setting a distracting color. Restrict background colors to only the contact details section of your signature if you are interested in using them. This will not detract the reader from the overall message
Use background color cleverly to draw an eye towards the content. This can be done if you create an impression that that content and image are all part of one consistent message.
Avoid using large images. Good image size varies with client and the device they use to read them. Also, if you use a photo editor like Photoshop; for the sake of understanding, reduce it from 1850x370 pixels to just 600x120.
You may consider using a relatively large image for a new client to create an impact; however, long term clients usually prefer a gentler style since they are already familiar with you.

, To increase the visibility of your contact details in order to ensure that the recipient is well informed, you must tone down the graphical elements of the signature. Here are a couple things to keep in mind:


Either you brand above or below the message. The combined size should not be beyond 200 pixels. Simple branding is no more than 100 pixels.
If you are using software to create a signature rendering a branded margin, width should be no more than 50 pixels. The ideal margin should be 20-36 pixels that will not clutter your message.

, It is simply overwhelming for your audience if you include all methods of contact. This gives the impression that you are desperate to be reached. It could also be confusing if you include your physical address amongst a long list of social networks.


Commonly made mistakes let people totally overlook your emails. In doing so, you will be in no position to communicate your intended message and the chances of creating a long term relationship will be limited.

, This is not practical because certain email clients have been designed to block images altogether. In case your signature is an image it would be equivalent to receiving an email from a person whose address is unknown – you cannot contact them back. An unreadable signature is a worst thing that can happen to you if you want a response.

, A large number of people now check their emails on their mobile devices. If it’s not readable, the reader is likely to do away with it. Remember that functionality is more important than the design. When people are on their phones, they're mainly looking for something then can read quickly.

, If you include a link to a blog for the sake of earning readership or a social network account that hasn’t been updated for ages, this is irrelevant information. It does not benefit your client in the slightest. Instead, it just gives the impression that you are not serious.


Additionally, avoid temptations like adding your favorite quotations (this may include quotes from religious sources as they may offend someone) and choosing multiple font types, font colors and sizes in your signature. This is considered highly unprofessional.

Determine the purpose of your email marketing campaign.,
Put together a mailing list of possible customers.,
Decide which of the 2 main types of email marketing campaigns you want to utilize.,
Design the components of your email.,
Draw your customers in from the very beginning.",How to Create a Strong Email Marketing Campaign," Common reasons for undertaking such a project include introducing a new product or service, offering discounts to boost sales or to move excess products, or further constructing your brand and getting your name out to more and more potential buyers.;
, Since the foundation of the campaign's success rests on the extent of customers it can reach, this is a key step in how to create a strong email marketing campaign. There are a variety of ways a mailing list can be constructed. To tackle this step yourself, set up an area of your company website where visitors can enter their email addresses to receive special offers, discounts and breaking news. You may also employ a third-party service that sells mailing lists, saving you a lot of time and work for a nominal fee.

, Promotions and newsletters are the most popular email campaigns. A promotion advertises your product or service and typically involves a special deal or discount to email recipients. Promotions are less frequently sent out than newsletters, which are a regular form of communication that keeps your customer base informed of new products, offers, and company news.

, In learning how to create a strong email marketing campaign, you can use a few different approaches to design. You can present the recipient with a standard-style email that is simple in appearance and form and straightforward in approach. Alternately, you can design a more flashy campaign, using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or special design software to craft bold styles that can be eye-catching and present your company or service in an unforgettable manner.

, Use a ""hook"" to appeal to your readers and grab their attention the second they open the email. This might include posing a question, the use of memorable language, the promise of a discount, or the sharing of a powerful story. A hook ensures your customers read the entirety of the email and learn about the offer you are presenting.

, This isn't necessary to listen to or to download music, but there are a number of features that you'll be able to access, including the ability to write reviews and share music with other users. It's also free of charge.


Just click the sign up link at the top right of every page. You can either sign in with a Facebook account or just pick a username and password, put in your email and you're done!

At any time on the main screen, you'll also find the ""Selections"" menu, which will redirect you to the Top 100 tracks of the week.


In the upper right-hand corner, you can use the search box to query for music by genre, artist, and other fields.

, Once you have selected a track, the Jamendo player should open like this. The purple speech bubble button will take you to a page where you can ""share"" the music with other Jamendo users, or via Facebook or email; the plus button will add it to a playlist and clicking the downwards arrow will download that track only.

, Just click ""Music"" on the bar at the top and then select ""Tags"" from the drop down menu. This opens a page of hundreds of different things albums have been tagged with - from the more conventional pop, rock, etc. to things like ""drone"" and ""breakcore"". The larger the text of that phrase, the more albums that have been tagged with it. Upon clicking a tag phrase, it will load a page of all albums tagged thus, ordered by their popularity that month.

, Go to ""Music"" on the search bar and pick ""External Artists"" Put in the name of an external artist that you like, and the site will come up with a list of music that they have that's similar to that artist/band.

, - Music is available in MP3 format for direct download, and if you have a BitTorrent client, you can also download Ogg Vorbis files from peers. The direct download menu has these other options on the left-hand side.

, These can be really handy when listening to music, and will also show the rest of the community what you are listening to. You can add either songs or whole albums to your playlist by clicking the little + button next to them, which says ""Add to a playlist"" on mouseover. A window will pop up allowing you to add the song(s) to an existing playlist or to create a new one. You can view and edit your playlists from the menu on the right hand side of your profile or at http://www.jamendo.com/en/user/username/playlists (replacing username with your username).

, To edit your profile, simply click on ""Edit data"" under the picture on your profile. On this page you will be able to change around your private data, so changing your password, etc. and also edit your profile. Personalising your profile is a way to show people what you like, and what you are like. Get to it!



Your avatar - This will allow you to change your profile picture, either by uploading a JPG or PNG file from your computer or by picking one from the already stocked avatar gallery.

Your personal data - Here you can put in some personal information about your self, including your location, website, email address, name and a section labelled ""Write whatever you want here"" which will show up on your profile under ""Personal data"". Be careful with giving out too many personal details however, especially if you are younger.

Your musical tastes - Jamendo is a music site: tell it which music you like! This page will allow you to specify your favourite artists on and off Jamendo and whether you have seen them live, your favourite genres, the instruments you play and the music software you use!

Manage your social network preferences (Facebook, Twitter) - You can sign in with your Facebook or Twitter accounts here, so that you can post automatically when, e.g. you add an artist or album to your favorites, or write a review. The options are yours to customise.

, Jamendo allows you to ""star"" artists or individual albums, and your most recently starred items will show up on your profile page. You can easily star both albums and artists by simply clicking the heart button next to the picture on their page, and to un-star them for any reason, just click on it again.

, To add somebody as a friend, simply go to their profile and click on the ""Add to my friends"" button below their profile picture. Here you can also choose to send somebody a private message. You can access your private message inbox by selecting the little mail icon underneath your own picture on your profile page. Jamendo also has forums at http://forum.jamendo.com/ - try interacting and making friends with other users there!


There are also options at the top right of most pages labelled ""Invite your friends to join Jamendo"". Using these you can search for your friends on Jamendo by email address, or send them an invitation to join if they have not yet been enlightened.

, This will give the musicians some feedback, show other users what you thought of a particular album and also be helpful to them when deciding whether to download it. To write a review of an album just click on ""Write a review"" at the top of the album page. Try listening to the album a couple of times before reviewing, so that it is not just based on your first impressions.


First of all, give it a rating. This is optional, but will quickly allow people to see how much you liked the album overall. Ratings range from ""0: Unbearable"" to ""10: Awesome"".
Under the heading ""What are you saying?"" write a short sentence summarising what you want to say in the review, and then comes the bulk of it.
Try to stay polite, but still say what you honestly thought of it. Some good ideas to include in your review would be what your favourite tracks are and why, what the album sounds like, whether you like the cover design and how would it sound in a live setting, etc. Write whatever you want - make it your own!
Under this there is also a box allowing you to quickly star that album if you haven't already before clicking ""Submit"".

Set up web hosting.,
Acquire a domain name.,
Use web design tools to create basic page design.,
For a transactional landing page, make sure that you have included code modules that present a usable form or application for visitors to complete.,
Think about using social media links in your landing page.",How to Create a Landing Page," In order to create a landing page, you'll need to have a web hosting service, a server that will keep all your data available and let your pages be accessible to the Internet. Web hosting services abound, and you can easily make a simple contract with one of these companies to get your own online space for presenting landing pages and other aspects of your site.;
, The domain name is also an important part of a web project. The domain name is the name of your URL or web address, and choosing the right ones is important. Find the right web real estate to give your project visibility.


Check with nationally recognized domain name sellers. An elite group of organizations is involved with selling the rights to different domain names. Find out what is available and what will fit your business needs.

, Start building your page, adding text, images and whatever else you need to make your landing page work.


Use graphic design to create a visually compelling web page. You may want to rely on graphic design professionals, or put much of your own work into the visual appeal of the landing page. Using high-contrast color graphics and text, as well as stylized fonts or borders, can help make your page more appealing and draw in more visitors.
Optimize your web content. The text that you put on your landing page matters a great deal to the success of your web project. You may want to optimize your SEO, or search engine optimization, with certain keywords, but be sure that your text is reader-friendly and sounds natural to get the best chances of success.
Build in elements according to your type of landing page. For a reference landing page, work on elegant graphics and slogans. For example, if you have a landscaping business with an existing color logo and a slogan related to your craft, try to make sure that both of these can be reproduced on the reference landing page in the same way that they are printed on a business card or other promotional materials. This will make your reference landing page a more effective way to increase your brand visibility.

, The code modules on your functional transactional page should be pieces of computer code that allow users to do the things that you want them to do on your page. They need to be written flawlessly in order to work well.


Build in functionality to your landing page with an auto-responder. The auto-responder can send out email messages based on who visits your site. This is a way to use information compiled from your web visitors to your advantage.
Add pay per click (PPC) items or other monetizing functions. In a pay per click scenario, a web page owner places advertisements from other companies on their site. These outside or ""affiliate"" advertisers pay the web page owner when the ad is clicked into by a user. Some web builders can use these kinds of programs to get more money out of their web project. Take a look at PPC or other helpful elements of site design.

, One of the best ways to reach out to a diverse modern audience is through today's social media sites, which many web users look to for a variety of their daily searches and online tasks.


Evaluate Facebook markup language (FBML). This new markup language allows webpage designers to link their pages to Facebook, a social media platform that gives visibility to all sorts of businesses, public events and more.

Go to the website 'spreaker.com'.,
After you have verified your account you are ready to begin.,
Live or recorded?,
Broadcasting Live: Spreaker.com gives you a broadcasting tool unlike most sites.,
Preparing to go On Air: Before you go on air you must obviously have music ready.,
Going on Air: Once you have uploaded get your playlist ready!,
When you are ready, click the record button and wait until the 'ON AIR' light is on.,
Extras on Air: You add your 'Jingles' which are the theme tunes to your podcast.,
Commercial Breaks: When you need a break you can click the 'Commercial break' button next to record.,
Finishing Up: So you've recorded it all and you want to save it.,
Getting Noticed: So you've recorded and saved and all is well so far, just one thing...No one has listened in!",How to Create a Podcast on Spreaker.com," (http://www.spreaker.com/) Create an account (it's free for basic, you have to pay for premium). Before you choose a username think about it. Use your own name, or your DJ Name or The podcast's name.;
, You are able to connect to your facebook account (optional) if you wish to share your episodes to your friends. You are ready to record. Click the 'Broadcast' tab at the top to start. Name the episode you are going to play for example my podcast plays metal music, so I come up with names like 'LOUD NOIZE'. Catchy names are best if you want to get spotted. You can choose what show you want then. Always click the more options before you broadcast. This Involves adding tags (key words so people can find it when searching), the description (mention famous artists you're gonna play on the show e.g Pop music; Kanye West, Rihanna or Rock music; AC/DC, Iron Maiden), and you can change the show you want the episode to appear in. (An episode is part of the show.) The default name for the show is 'My First Radio Show'. If you want to change this you can click add new show. You can use an image for this to make it look interesting!

, Once you've filled out your details and description you have a choice to upload a recorded podcast you recorded recently or broadcast live. If you want to upload make sure the full podcast is a full .mp3 or .wav. If you are uploading make sure you select the 'Upload Podcast' button next to the 'Create An Episode' Title. If you are broadcasting live then you won't need to do this and can continue to the big 'Broadcast' button below your options.

, This is like software but online instead of installing anything. This is easier and quicker. Hardware you will need. A Microphone if you wish to talk in the episode will obviously be needed. Most laptops have their own built in mic. You must obviously find this and speak into that. This is not as clear as plug in hardware so separate hardware is recommended.If you own a copy of the game 'Rock Band TM' or 'Guitar Hero TM' then they might have come with these microphones in the packs. If you don't you would be able to buy then in gaming or electronic stores for a reasonable price. If you have a different mic at home that connects fine you are free to use it. NOTE: Connect the mic before you click the 'Broadcast' button.

, NOTE: The one disadvantage of the basic mode is that broadcasting live can only be up to 30 minutes and your music library must be under 1 hour. (The 30 minutes does not count if you are uploading a podcast, only if you are live). Upload the necessary music (make sure the site supports the format) for one episode. When finished recording, delete the songs in your library and upload new ones for the next episode. This won't affect anything. Upload the music files straight from your drive or if it's not your laptop or computer, plug in your mp3 player of music and upload from that (the files you upload to Spreaker are not uploaded to your drive). Getting back to the point of it being 30 minutes long, if you upgrade to premium you get 3 hours but the basic is free and you get 30 minutes.


Spreaker have deals though! If you do certain things like invite friends from facebook to spreaker you'll get premium free for 1 month.

, Once all has been uploaded go to the 'Latest' tab on the adding music area and add the songs you've uploaded. Now you are ready to go on air. Drag the song you want onto the decks provided and test your mic.

, Speak into the mic and then introduce the song. Then click play on the deck. Make sure you mute the mic deck while playing a song! You don't your listeners to hear people talking in the background.

, This is optional but for more listeners it's recommended. You also add sound FX for comedy while you talk. There is a chat box too in the bottom right hand corner in the tool and when you listen so you and your listeners can chat.

, If you want to stop the podcast all together just click the 'record' button.


When recording live the timer will come to the limit of the break and stop recording and play the commercial break, then go back to you. Watch the timer and make sure the times are evened out.

, When you've clicked the 'record' button to stop (or your time runs out), you will exit the tool and be brought back to the normal looking site. It will let you preview, edit the details, download or delete the podcast. Remember to click save (if there is a save button) or all your work will go to waste!

, First visit other people shows or accounts who play similar music to you and follow them. Then go to the chat box of there episode and say to all the listeners..'Come Listen to my show, I Play similar music to this guy!' and eventually people will see and say yeah this guy is good. They will follow you and listen more often.

Check out your copied website.",How to Copy a Website1," If you want to copy an entire site, or a large number of pages from a site at once, you'll want the help of an automatic site downloader. Trying to manually save each page would be a much too time-consuming task, and these utilities will automate the entire process.


The most popular and powerful website copying program is HTTrack, an open source program available for Windows and Linux. This program can copy an entire site, or even the entire internet if configured (im)properly! You can download HTTrack for free from www.httrack.com.;
, Once you’ve opened HTTrack, you’ll need to set a destination folder for the website files. Make sure to create a dedicated folder for your website copies, or you may have difficulty tracking them down in the future.


Give your project a name to help you locate it. HTTrack will create a folder in your destination directory with your project name.

, This will ensure that HTTrack will download all of the content from the website, including any pictures or other files.

, You can enter in multiple websites if you'd like to copy multiple sites in the same project directory. By default, HTTrack will grab every possible link from that website that stays on the same web server.


If the website you want to copy requires you to log in, use the “Add URL” button to enter the website address as well as the username and password.

, Once you have entered your URLs, you can begin the copying process. Depending on the size of the website, the download process can take a significant amount of time and bandwidth to complete. HTTrack will show the progress of all the files you are copying to your computer., Once the download is complete, you can open the copied website and browse it directly from your computer. Open any of the HTM or HTML files in a web browser to view the pages as if you were online. You can also open these files in a web page editor to see all of the code that makes them work. The files will be localized by default so that links point to the downloaded files and not to the website. This allows for completely offline viewing.

Create the text or image you want to use as a link.,
Surround the content you created with the tags.,
Add the ""href"" attribute to indicate the hyperlink destination.",How to Create a Link1," Links are created using a simple HTML tag when editing the code of your website. First, however, you should create the content that will be placed inside the tag. This can be text, an image, or another HTML element, though the example used here is text.;
, Hyperlinks are indicated using a simple tag, closed with the corresponding tag. These tags won't be functional if used without any attributes, but you can add those soon.


For example, your link might currently look like this: Click here to visit my new page.

, The ""href"" attribute tells the browser where to direct the user once the link is clicked. It is followed by an equals sign, which is followed by the destination web address in quotations.


Continuing with the example above, your link might now look like this: Click here to visit my new page.
Note that if the link's destination is an external website, you must include the entire URL (which likely begins with ""http""). If only the page name is specified, as above, the directory of the current page will be used as the parent directory.

Examine your own motives.,
Read up on how to Practice Nonviolent Communication.,
State your observation.,
State your feelings.,
State your need.,
Make a request.,
Remember that no means no.",How to Convince Someone to Use DuckDuckGo," Remember that they are their own person, and you need to respect their decisions, even if you disagree with them. Be zen about it. Repeat out loud, to yourself, by yourself, the following affirmation: ""I accept and respect ___'s individuality."" This may seem silly but if you're actually getting bent out of shape over what someone else is doing on their phone or computer, this can come across as condescending (and in a way, it is) so it's good to remember not to get frustrated over the choices other people make.;
, This is a great opportunity to practice your communication skills, which may or may not benefit your cause here, but will definitely benefit the strength and resiliency of your relationship (any relationship) in general.

, Try to avoid lacing it with your evaluation of the facts. Just state the facts. Instead of saying ""I noticed you've been selling your search soul to Google"" say ""I noticed you've been using Google to search the Internet."" Better yet, do this when they actually do a search in front of you, to show that you're being observant. Let's say they looks up movie times on her phone: ""Hey, are those Google search results?""

, Vulnerable feelings like fear and love are more effective in scenarios with significant others and some close family members than feelings like anger, and the opposite may be true for friends. While saying, ""I'm pissed that Google has all your data stored in their servers and is sharing it with advertisers and the government"" may be effective for your poker buddies, ""I'm scared that the NSA knows what movies I watch with my kids"" may be better for a significant other, as could be ""It's scary to me that Google collects data on so many facets of our life."" Paraphrase as needed.

, Note that this does not simply mean saying ""I need you to switch to DuckDuckGo for all your Internet searches."" Dig a little deeper. Try something like ""I need to feel like I connect with someone who has many of the same values as I do, and Internet privacy is something I value strongly.""

, Remember, it's a request, not a demand. A good starting point might be: ""Since our lives and thus our data are intertwined, would it be okay if I changed the default search engine on your phone and browser to DuckDuckGo?"" If they respond negatively, it's time to compromise. There are a few things you can do here:


Ask them why they're averse to changing their default search engine. See How to Be a Good Listener.
Ask if there is anything they value strongly that you can do to share in the value.
Suggest that they try it out only for a week or a month, and if they don't like it, you'll change everything back.

, If they don't want to use DuckDuckGo, let it go.

Download SiteSucker from the Mac App Store.,
Enter the URL of the website that you want to copy.,
Click the ""Download"" button to begin saving the website.,
Enter your username and password if prompted.,
View your copied website after it is finished downloading.",How to Copy a Website2," This is a free program that will allow you to download complete copies of websites. You can also download SiteSucker from the website at ricks-apps.com/osx/sitesucker/index.html.


If you download the app from the website, double-click the downloaded DMG file. Drag the SiteSucker application icon to your Applications folder to install it.

, With SiteSucker's default settings, every page on the website will be copied and downloaded to your computer. SiteSucker will follow every link it finds but will only download files from the same web server.


Advanced users can adjust the settings for SiteSucker, but if you just want to copy a website you don't need to worry about changing anything. SiteSucker will copy the complete website by default.
One setting that you may want to change is the location for the copied website on your computer. Click the Gear button to open the Settings menu. In the ""General"" section, use the ""Destination"" menu to select where you want the files to be saved.

, SiteSucker will start downloading all of the content from the website that you entered into the URL field. This can potentially take a very long time, and you can monitor the progress in the bottom part of the SiteSucker window.

, If you're trying to download content from a password protected site, you'll be prompted for your login information. By default, SiteSucker will check your Keychain first to see if your login information is already stored. If it isn't, you'll need to enter this information manually., Once you have finished downloading the site, you can view it offline just as if you were online. SiteSucker will localize the web pages so that they point to the local downloaded files instead of the original online address. This allows you to view the entire site without an internet connection.

Create an image link.,
Create an email link using the ""mailto:"" modifier.,
Create anchors within a large web page to be referenced later.",How to Create a Link2," This is done by simply adding an image tag within the link tags. You will need the address of the hosted image, however (such as its location on your server or another server). Here is what an example image link might look like:


<a href=""the_intended_link_url.html""><img src=""the_picture_in_question.jpg"" /></a>

, To create a link which will begin composing an email message to a particular address, use the ""mailto:"" modifier just before the person's email address.


For example, an email link might look like this: Click here to ask a question or voice a concern.

, If you need to link to a specific portion of a web page, you need to use an anchor. Anchors are useful in large pages with a table of contents; each section of the text can be assigned an anchor to which the table of contents can link. Anchors are created using the ""name"" attribute.


To create an anchor, insert the following tag at the appropriate location on the page: Chapter 3 - Using Anchors in HTML
To link to the anchor you created, use the # sign as follows: Skip to Chapter 3

Limit your usage.,
Run a virus scan on your computer.,
Choose your websites wisely.,
Try not to play online games.,
Contact your service provider.",How to Cope With a Slow Internet Connection," Playing videos and surfing at the same time can be frustrating with a low internet speed. Choose your priorities and use internet as per your needs. Example: Need to complete your homework? You might want to get the information first before watching videos about games or other stuff.;
, If it's slow on internet, chances are it has a virus. If you don't have anti-virus, get one. Try getting AVG or Avast, there can be downloaded freely online.


If you don't have a virus, update your modem or router. Chances are that it's out of date.
If modem/router are working well, try to clear out programs you don't need. These include programs that take a lot of memory or that are used rarely.

, A websites consuming a lot of data can take too much time to load on your browser. Choose efficient yet informative websites. Try using Black Google Search rather than the usual one.

, Online games, MMORPGs, or other games can consume a lot of data and will considerably slow down your internet usage.

, Sometimes, it could be a problem at the provider's end. Contact them if you feel you are getting very low internet connection, lower than what you deserve according to your data plan.

Consider your story.,
Make a good first impression on your readers.,
Test the waters.,
Write stories that will be rated appropriate for everyone.,
Consider extrinsic factors.,
Self promote.,
Improve yourself.,
Improve your profile.",How to Boost Your Chances of Getting a Review on Fanfiction.Net," Does your summary entice readers or put them off?


Keep the summary positive and relevant to the story. One option is to put a quote in from the story - it shows your writing style (which may immediately interest the reader.) Another option is to pose a question or teaser in your summary: Dawn Summers is used to letting her superhero sister Buffy take care of all the vampires in town, but when a new vamp turns up while Buffy's on vacation, Dawn decides to take matters into her own hands. Has she got what it takes to be a hero too, or has she bitten off more than she can chew?
Use full sentences.
Check for spelling mistakes and word omissions. Sometimes it's what isn't there that is causing the problem.;
, What do readers see when they click on your story? You'd be surprised what people decide about a story before they have even started to read it.


Differentiate the story from any author's notes, disclaimers, or warnings. Common methods include using a line break or centered dashes, or heading the start of the story with the title/chapter title. Divide up everything properly, and keep rechecking after a couple of days - some sites don't update immediately.
Make use of paragraph spaces to break up text in appropriate places. A wall of text is never nice to read through. Also remember to divide up long stretches of speech, and if writing a poem, each verse or stanza needs to be on its own.
Restrict use of bold and italics; use them for emphasis. Don't be afraid to make a flash back a separate chapter, or divide using a page divider, dots, or dashes rather than all in italics.
Re-read before posting.
Spell-check before posting.
Look at your punctuation. Is it consistent? Does it help the reader? Be prepared to edit.
If you trust a beta and have access to one, make use of him/her.
It's very tempting to post as soon as something is finished; if you can, resist this impulse. Wait a day or better still a week before you re-read, edit and post. You'll be amazed at the number of mistakes and odd turns of phrase you encounter when you pick it up again.

, Post one or two chapters at a time. The word count of a large multi-chaptered story posted in one go may put some readers off. Be prepared for a slow start to the number of reviews. When it gets good, they'll come.

, Is the rating reducing traffic to your story? Is the story rated M? These stories only come up on the main page when a searcher looks for stories of all ratings or with an M rating.

, It might not be you or your story. If you're confident your story looks inviting but you're still not getting any reviews, consider the fandom. Is it very active?


Check your hit numbers.
Do other writers' stories get reviews? Lots of reviews? Ask yourself what kind of stories seem the most popular. Maybe you're writing for an unpopular pairing. You may need to be prepared to do some extra work to encourage reviewers.

, If your fandom is small and not very active, you may have to take other steps to advertise your story. Is there a livejournal community where you can advertise it? A fanfiction.net community?

, Fandoms can be fickle; maybe it's just not your story's time - or maybe it's time to go on a charm offensive.


Are you new to the fandom? Let other writers know you're interested in their stories. Why should anyone be interested in your story if you seem uninterested in the fandom you're writing for?
Review stories that interest you and writers you admire. Be a constructive critic. You aren't the only one wanting good reviews, Try leading by example and helping fellow writers by reviewing their work. Go into detail about the things you like and the things you feel needs improving. Not only will it attract the writer's attention and gratitude, but other readers as well with a taste of your writing skills and insight.

, What does it say about you? It looks a little funny if you write a story for one fandom but all your favorite authors are in another fandom....

It can be a bit obsessive if you're not careful and might chew up your cash if you spend a lot on items to go with it (although that doesn't have to be the case). However, it can be oodles of fun, allowing you to explore more about the genre or type of activity the fandom relates to, meet others as into it as you and even spark your creativity through such things as writing fandom fiction, poetry or making fandom art.

Do not go into a fandom just because one of your friends is in that fandom. You will find it hard to enjoy and other fans might be disdainful or unkind to you if they discover that you don't really belong.;
, There is a range of possibilities, depending on your personality type, preference and current interests. Some examples include: Crazy fangirl or fanboy; emotional fangirl or fanboy; normal fangirl or fanboy; hip fangirl or fanboy; and the I-Know-Everything fangirl or fanboy. Or, you may simply wish to be a super fan and embrace a range of approaches to the fandom.

, The most common genres for fandom are bands, movies, books and TV series. You might also choose cartoons, anime, documentaries or some other type of entertainment or communications field which could do with having some fans., Start participating in your fandom. Things you can do include:

Watch the shows related to your fandom or listen to the music.
Decorate your room to express your fandom.
Collect things to do with your fandom.

Assess what you're downloading.,
Look over the site.,
Consider who you are downloading the file from.,
Are there other people that have downloaded the file?,
Look at the size of the file.,
Watch out for executable files, such as '.exe', '.bat', '.pif', and '.scr'.,
Is the file signed?",How to Know when It Is Safe to Download Something," Are you downloading pornography or a warez (cracked) program? Or are you downloading an add-on to help improve your Mozilla Firefox experience? There's a much greater chance that the pornography and warez software is going to contain a virus hidden in the download. What's the file? That's your first clue. If it is illegal or suspicious looking, it's probably dangerous.;
, It may seem superficial, but if you're downloading a file from a very basic site there's a higher chance that the site will have a virus hidden in its downloadable files than from a site that looks like it's been made from years of dedicated web designers.

, Think about it logically, if you're downloading something from Windows, say, it's not likely that you're downloading a virus. What's the context? That's the key.

, If there's a forum attached to the site that has people saying they've downloaded said file and have not experienced any problems, chances are, you aren't going to be downloading a Trojan or worm.

, If it's too small for what it is, it's junk.

, If you download one of these you are, potentially, opening yourself up to anything on that file once you activate it. Try scanning it with a virus checker or any other software that is like it - just to be on the safe side. One common trick used by crackers is to have a 'double extension' such as '.gif.exe'. Said file is actually an .exe, not a .gif.

, If you are downloading an executable (.exe) program on Windows, running it will usually open a license warning. If the executable is unlicensed, it is most likely a threat to your computer and privacy. (Note that not all unlicensed executables are bad, nor are all licensed executables good. If unsure, refer to the Tips section.)

Consider whether anything out of the usual is happening on your computer.,
Go online.,
Look for other standard hacker malware, overrides, etc.,
If you simply won't have any control over anything you do, prioritize the probability that you are at the receiving end of being hacked.,
Disconnect from the internet immediately.,
Start up the computer in safe mode.,
Check if there aren't any ""new programs"" (eg.,
Do a sweep of your computer with an anti-virus/spyware scanner you trust (for example, Avast Home Edition, AVG Free edition, Avira AntiVir, etc.).,
If that turns up with nothing, back up important files.,
Contact your bank and any store accounts you have to alert them to a possible problem.,
Alert friends that they may have received compromised emails from you.",How to Know if You've Been Hacked," You know your computer and how it runs better than anyone else. If it was working okay before but suddenly starts behaving oddly, it might be a sign of age or a broken part but the following issues could be just as likely to be signs of a hacking:


You have standard programs and files that won't open or work.
Files that you didn't delete appear to have disappeared, have been placed in the bin or have been deleted.
You cannot access programs using your usual password. You find that your passwords have been changed within your computer.
There is one or more programs on your computer that you didn't put there.
When you're not using the computer, it is connecting itself to the internet frequently.
File contents have been changed and you didn't do the changes.
Your printer may behave strangely. It may not print no matter what you do or it will print different pages that you did not command it to.;
, Here too you can find possible signs of having been hacked:


One or more sites refuse you access because of password failure. Try various of your usual sites; if the password access continues to be barred, this may be due to having been hacked. Did you respond to a phishing email by any chance (a fake email asking you to change security details/update passwords)?
Your internet searches are being redirected.
Extra browser screens may appear. They may switch on and off without you doing anything. They may be a shade darker or the same color but you'll be able to see them.
If you've bought a domain name, you may not be able to obtain it once you've paid for it.

, Here are some other things that might occur when hacked:


Fake virus messages. Either you have virus software or you don't; if you don't, such messages will automatically alert you. If you do, then provided you know what your program's messages should look like, then you'll also be alerted to the messages being fakes. Do not click on it; it's a scam to get you to release credit card details in a panic to get rid of viruses on your computer. Be aware that the hacker is already controlling your computer (see What to Do below).
Additional toolbars appear in your browser. They may carry messages about ""helping"" you. There should only be one toolbar. Be suspicious if they multiply.
Random and frequent pop-ups appear on your computer. You'll need to get rid of the program that is doing this.
Your anti-malware, virus software doesn't work, appears disconnected. Your Task Manager or Registry Editor may also be out of action.
People in your email address list get fake emails from you.
Money is missing from your bank account or you get bills to pay for online purchases you haven't made.

, In particular, if your mouse cursor is moving around the screen and performing real actions that have actual results, a human is at the other end manipulating this. If you've ever had to allow access to work I.T. to fix your computer remotely, you'll know what this looks like when it's done for benign purposes. If it's not authorized, then you've been hacked.


Check your personal information. Google yourself. Are there returns of personal information online that you haven't personally released? This may not show up immediately but keeping an eye on this possibility may be important if personal information is released.

, The best thing to do while continuing to investigate is to disconnect from the internet and online connectivity. That way, if a hacker is still in your computer, you've just removed the source of connection.


Pull the router plug out of the socket to be absolutely certain there is no connection!
Print this page off or PDF it before powering down so that you can continue to follow the instructions offline. Or, read it on a separate device that isn't hacked.

, Keep it disconnected completely and use your computer's safe mode to reopen it (check the computer's operating manual if you're not sure what to do).

, Anti-virus, Anti-spyware, etc.) OR if programs and files won't work or open. If you find anything, uninstall it as best you can. If you don't know how, get a computer-savvy helper or call mobile computing help to come and do it for you.

, Again, get someone knowledgeable to help you if you're unsure what to do.

, Then do a complete system restore and update the computer.

, Ask them for advice about what to do next to protect your funds.

, Warn them to delete the emails and to not follow any links if they have opened them.

Ensure that the source of the internet is on.,
Understand that most mobile devices can only connect to wireless broadband.,
Know what ""path"" to take to get to your network settings.",How to Connect to the Internet1," It may seem obvious, but a common mistake that's often made when connecting to the internet is not making sure the source of the internet is on. Especially if you've just set up a router and/or modem, ensure that it's on and that everything is plugged in properly, and that any lights on it aren't indicating that there are problems. Cords can also be unplugged or slightly pulled out of the wall, rendering the operation futile. Make sure that everything is plugged in properly and is working right before getting started.

, Devices like smartphones, mobile tablets, iPods, handheld gaming systems, and so forth can usually only connect to Wi-Fi services, due to the portable nature of them. Therefore, you won't be able to connect a mobile device to ethernet or to a dial-up network. Ethernet and dial-up connections are limited to computers and non-portable gaming devices (not covered in this article).

, Regardless of what operating system or device you're using, you'll probably need to access your network settings at some point in the process. The process is slightly different for every device, but the general path that you'll need to take to access your network settings is usually the same, depending on the OS. Some common devices or operating systems, and their paths to the settings, are listed below.



Windows XP: Start –> Control Panel –> Network and Internet Connections

Windows Vista: Start –> Network –> Network and Sharing Center

Windows 7: Start –> Control Panel –> Network and Internet

Windows 8: Start –> Search ""View network connections"" –> View Network Connections

Windows 10: Search ""View network connections"" –> View Network Connections

Mac OS X Jaguar and later: System Preferences –> Network

Ubuntu and Fedora: Network Manager

iOS (iPhone, iPad, etc.): Settings –> Wi-Fi

Android: Settings –> Wi-Fi (or Wireless & Networks)

Windows phone: Settings –> Wi-Fi

"
"
Make sure that the Wi-Fi connection for your device is on.,
Access your device's settings.,
Find the name of your Wi-Fi network.,
Enter the password to the network or hotspot.,
Wait for the computer to connect.,
Test out your internet connection.,
Troubleshoot if your computer won't connect to the internet.",How to Connect to the Internet2," Regardless of the device, it's possible to turn off Wi-Fi. Some devices have a physical switch that turns on or turns off the Wi-Fi, while others just have the ability to toggle Wi-Fi on the software settings. Make sure that the computer does not have the Wi-Fi capability turned off before proceeding.;
, Navigate to your device's settings and open them, and then navigate to the network settings. You can also click on the Wi-Fi icon on a computer's toolbar to open up a dropdown menu, which will list the names of the connections in the area.

, Your broadband network's router should have the default name written on it. The name of a hotspot network will usually show up by default as the name of your cellular device (e.g. ""'s iPhone""). Find this name and select it.


Wi-Fi or hotspot names can be changed, but if you've changed the name of your network or hotspot, you probably know what it is. If you weren't the one to change it, or you don't know what the name is, ask the person in charge of the network.

, Some networks are public, but most aren't. If the network you're trying to connect to has a password, you'll be prompted for that password before you can connect to the network. The default password will usually be listed on the router, but if you don't know the password, ask the person in charge of the network.


Some protected public networks may have varying passwords per person. For example, a school may allow students to log on to the network with their student ID number, rather than a single set password.

, It often takes a few seconds for a computer to connect to a wireless source, but if the computer can't establish the connection to the router, it will time out the Wi-Fi connection. In this case, move closer to the source, or disconnect and then reconnect your computer to the Wi-Fi.

, Once you've connected to the internet, open up a page in your web browser and wait for it to load. Since some pages can crash, you may want to load up a reputable website, such as google.com or isup.me to ensure that the website isn't going to be down.

, For some people, the Wi-Fi will connect without a hitch. For others, that's not the case. There are many reasons that a computer may not be able to connect to the wireless connection; most computers have a built-in software that can distinguish what the problem is. A few common problems are listed below:


Some older computers are unable to connect to the internet wirelessly. You may need an ethernet cable to get online.
If the internet is slow or won't connect, you may be out of range of the router or hotspot. Try moving closer to the source.
If the network isn't showing up, you may be out of range, or the network may be down. Try moving closer or rebooting your router.

"
"
Get an ethernet cable and any needed adapters.,
Connect one end of the ethernet cable to the broadband source.,
Connect the other end of the cable to the computer.,
Access your computer's settings.,
Test out your internet connection.,
Troubleshoot if you can't connect.",How to Connect to the Internet3," Many recent devices can connect directly to the router via an ethernet cable. However, some aren't built to do that. Laptops, for example, often don't have components for using ethernet. For that reason, make sure you get any adapters you may need for the ethernet cable to ensure that you can use it.


Ethernet cables are all different; for example, a Cat-5 or Cat-5e cable runs at slower speeds than a Cat-6. However, it's also largely dependent on the router's connection and how many people will be connecting to the network at once. Unless you're doing very, very intensive upload work, you're probably not going to need a Cat-6 cable if you're the only one on the network.
You cannot connect a mobile device (e.g. a smartphone) to ethernet with an adapter.

, The broadband source will most likely be a router, but in some cases, it may be a modem. In either case, you'll need to plug in one end of the ethernet cable to the broadband source to ensure that the computer will connect.

, Find the ethernet jack on your computer and plug it in. This jack will typically be located on the back of the computer, where the other components plug in.


If your computer doesn't support ethernet, you'll need to make sure the computer is connected to the adapter, and then connect the cord via the adapter.

, You'll need to ensure that the computer is set to recognize the ethernet, rather than wireless. Most likely, you'll have to turn off your wireless connection to ensure that the computer recognizes the ethernet connection instead.

, Open up a page in a web browser and see if it loads. Some web pages can take longer to load than others, and others crash sometimes, so you may want to try and load a reliable website (e.g. google.com or isup.me) to ensure that the connection is running.

, Ethernet is more reliable than Wi-Fi, but that doesn't mean that things still can't go wrong. If you're having trouble with the ethernet, it can stem from many problems, but make sure that the basics (e.g. the router being connected) are established, and that your computer isn't being troublesome.


Make sure there's no problem with the ethernet cable (which can range from ""the cord wasn't plugged in all the way"" to ""the cable is faulty/broken and needs to be replaced"").
Check if the router is having trouble, and reboot it if so. Contact your ISP if resetting the router doesn't work, but the cord and computer's ethernet connection work fine.
Rarely, your computer's ethernet card may turn out to be defective. If this is the case, contact the seller of your computer or the computer's manufacturer.

Understand that dial-up internet is no longer widely supported.,
Ensure that you can connect to dial-up.,
Plug in the modem to the phone jack.,
Connect the modem to the computer.,
Access your computer's network settings.,
Connect your computer's connection to the modem.,
Test out your internet connection.,
Troubleshoot if you can't connect.",How to Connect to the Internet4," Because dial-up internet has fallen out of use in favor of broadband internet, it's not common to see instructions for connecting to dial-up internet anymore. However, dial-up is still commonplace in a few rural areas, which means that you may find yourself needing to connect to it.

, Dial-up internet requires the use of a phone line, and can only connect one person per phone at a time. If somebody else is already connected, and/or the phone line is being used to make a call, you will be unable to connect until the other person disconnects or hangs up. Additionally, most new computers do not have the components to connect to dial-up; you may have to purchase an external USB modem so your computer can connect.

, Oftentimes, places with dial-up internet will have two phone lines - one for the phone, and one for the modem. However, if the modem isn't often used, it may be unplugged, or there may only be one phone line. Make sure that the phone cable is plugged into both the phone jack on the wall, and the plug on the modem.

, Using another phone line, insert one end of the second phone cable into the modem and the other end into the computer's modem jack (or the converter).


Make sure that you don't accidentally plug the phone cable into the ethernet plug by mistake. The phone jack on the computer should be noted by a small phone next to it.

, You'll need to manually set up the dial-up connection on the computer. From there, configure the modem settings. If this is your first time connecting to the dial-up source, you'll most likely need to configure the modem's network settings. While the process is slightly different for every OS, you'll need to enter the same information: the dial-up phone number, a username, and a password. The settings paths that you'll need to follow in order to configure the network are:



On Windows XP: Network and Internet Connections –> Set up or change your Internet connection –> Setup

On Windows Vista: Network and Sharing Center –> Set up a connection or network –> Set up a dial-up connection

On Windows 7 and 8: Network and Internet –> Network and Sharing Center –> Set up a new connection or network –> Connect to the Internet –> Dial-up

On Windows 10: Network –> Dial-up Connection

On Mac OS X: Network –> Internal/External Modem –> Configuration

On Ubuntu or Fedora: Network Manager –> Connections –> Modem Connections –> Properties

, If the dial-up settings are already configured, it may just be as simple as opening up the network settings and connecting to the modem, rather than searching for wireless connections. You will have to enter the number, username, and password, however.

, To ensure that your internet connection is working, open up a webpage and wait for it to load. Dial-up internet is much slower than typical broadband speeds, so don't be surprised if it takes some time. You may want to try and load a solely text-based webpage to increase the loading speed and tell if your internet is working.

, While dial-up is no longer widely supported, it's still possible to have issues with it. Ensure that the phone line is properly plugged in and that your system can connect to dial-up internet.


Windows 10 has been known to have some trouble with dial-up connections sometimes. You may have to use a computer with an older operating system, if available.
Ensure that you haven't accidentally plugged the phone cable into the ethernet jack by mistake. The phone cable's jack is smaller and is often denoted by a phone symbol.

Create a strong password!,
Use different passwords for each account.,
Create a ""security question"" only you would know.,
Don't become prey for ""phishing"".,
Keep your anti-virus software up-to-date and scan regularly.",How to Keep Online Accounts Secure," Yeah, it sounds obvious, but it is the most important step. Without a strong password it makes your account easier to hack. Some tips for creating a strong password are:


Make your password long. The longer the password, the more time consuming and harder to ""crack"".
Use UPPERCASE and lowercase letters. A mix of these provides more protection to your account, since passwords are case sensitive.
Use numbers and symbols. This adds another layer of protection, and makes your password stronger.
Using a word that isn't in any dictionary, or isn't even a word will also add more protection!
Don't use anything people close to you can guess. Sometimes they are the ones that can hack your accounts the easiest. Why worry? Arguments, and betrayals happen. Besides it's your account not theirs.

, Yes this may sound less feasible if you have multiple online accounts. At the very least be sure your email and bank accounts have totally different passwords. Especially your bank account, because if someone gains access to your account they have access to your money. Not a good thing.

, Some security questions such as ""What was the name of your first pet?"" is a topic that could have been brought up in past conversations. Choose a question that your best friend, mom, or sibling wouldn't know the answer to. Having a good security question will minimize the chances of someone close to you changing your password, or gaining access to your account.

, Phishing is when emails or websites claim to be the legitimate site you use, but are not, and actually are websites that gain your log-in information and use them for malicious purposes. If you get an email that looks suspicious, or doesn't seem believable, call the company (i.e. your bank) or do not click the link.

, Viruses, Trojans, and ""Worms"" can get your password, some are designed to do this. Even if the virus doesn't pose this risk it is still a great idea to keep your computer protected against security threats.

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
 
-----END CERTIFICATE-----





If the certificates are in a text file, you will need to change it to a .CRT file before uploading it
Check the keys that you download. There should be 5 dashes “-” on either side of the BEGIN CERTIFICATE and END CERTIFICATE lines. Also ensure that there are no extra spaces or line breaks inserted into the key.

, The certificates should be put in a folder dedicated to certificates and key files. An example location would be /usr/local/ssl/crt/. All of your certificates need to be in the same folder., Some versions of Apache have an “ssl.conf” file for the SSL certificates. Only edit one of the two if you have both. Add the following lines to the Virtual Host section:SSLCertificateFile /usr/local/ssl/crt/primary.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /usr/local/ssl/private/private.key
SSLCertificateChainFile /usr/local/ssl/crt/intermediate.crt





Save the changes to the file once you are finished. Re-upload the file if necessary.

, Once the file has been changed, you can start using your SSL certificate by restarting your server. Most versions can be restarted by entering the following commands:



apachectlp stop
apachectl startssl

Type your web address into the address bar.,
Don't bother to type out the protocol identifier unless you need to reach an encrypted site.,
Type the subdomain: www.,
Enter the domain name.",How to Type in a Web Address to Go to a Specific Website2," The web address is often called a URL: an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator. The URL (or web address) is a reference to a specific page or ""resource"" amid the vast, interconnected web of the Internet. A URL has two main parts: the protocol identifier and the resource name. The protocol identifier and the resource name are separated by a colon and two forward slashes.Protocol identifier: The first part of the URL is called a protocol identifier. It indicates what protocol to use. For the URL http://example.com , the protocol identifier is http.
Resource name: The second part of the URL is called a resource name. It specifies the IP address or the domain name where the resource is located. For the URL http://example.com , the resource name is example.com.

, You do not need to type the protocol unless you want to use a protocol other than the default. http:// is the default for most pages, but pages such as forms or logins should have https:// This means information is encrypted and prevents information from being intercepted.


Your browser may not show the protocol in the url. Check for a lock icon to signify the page is a secure https:// site. Pay attention to warnings your browser may have about the page's security certificate.
In the early days of the Internet, users needed to type the protocol identifier each time they wanted to visit a specific webpage. This is no longer necessary.

, www is actually just the default sub domain for web pages, and need not be included in a url. However, sites may have subdomains other than www, such as video.google.com. Make sure you include the subdomain if it is part of the url.

, example.com is a domain name, followed by the second-level domain, .com. This is the minimum you usually need to reach a website. Make sure you spell everything exactly right, and make sure you are using the correct second-level domain.


Some second-level domains are reserved for specific locations or industries. For example, .ca is reserved for Canadian websites, and .gov is reserved for government websites.
If you are entering the domain name, but the site isn't showing up, you might be trying the wrong domain. Check the spelling, and make sure that you're typing the right thing. If the page still doesn't show up, then the site might be defunct.

The file path always follows a ""/"". The ""/"" in a URL represents a subdirectory within the website. Each ""/"" marks that you are descending one level deeper into the site. The file path is followed by the file name, and sometimes the file extension ""example.com/subdirectory/filename.html"".


Most URLs do not require the file extension – it fills automatically. However, it is often necessary to include. Make sure you are entering the correct file path, as /page.php and /page.html are completely separate files

, You may be more likely to make a mistake when copying long chains of characters into the address box by hand. If you have access to the text of the web address, simply copy and paste it into the address bar.

, Strange characters may appear in the address bar: ?, #, and series of numbers. You don't need to worry about these, except insofar as you must copy out the chains of digits to reach certain specific sites.A ""?"" with numbers/letters following the url is called a parameter. Parameters are automatically generated and not necessary to type in.
A ""#"" followed by letters/numbers is called an anchor. Websites sometimes have certain points specified on a page, that let you jump directly to a specific place on the page. The page will automatically scroll to the place the anchor is found."

, This is another free anti-malware program that can help find and remove AdChoices and other malicious programs. You can get it from malwarebytes.org.

, This is another free aniti-adware program developed by Safer Networking. You can get the free version from safer-networking.org/mirrors

, It will be easier for these anti-adware programs to scan when your computer is running in Safe Mode.


Reboot your computer.
Repeatedly hit F8 before the Windows logo appears.
Select ""Safe Mode with Networking"" from the Advanced Startup menu.

Click here for more detailed instructions on entering Safe Mode.

, Start up AdwCleaner and click the ""Search"" button. Allow the program to scan your computer (this could take a few minutes).

, When AdwCleaner has finished scanning, it will return a list of results. By default, all of these should be checked already.

, AdwCleaner will eliminate all of the checked entries.

, Both of these operate similarly to AdwCleaner. Allow them to scan your computer, and then clean or quarantine the results of the scan.


Only run one scan at a time.

, Once you have run a scan with all three programs and removed any results, you can reboot your computer to exit Safe Mode and move on to the next section.

, Even if you don't use Internet Explorer, you should still go through these steps, since it is used in some system tasks.

,,,, You will be prompted to restart your computer.

, AdChoices infects all of your browsers, so open up Firefox if you have it installed, even if you don't use it. If you don't have it, skip down to the next browser.

, Start AdwareMedic and click ""Scan for Adware"". AdwareMedic scans are usually fairly quick.

, If AdwareMedic finds any adware files on your computer, it will list them along with the name of the adware program. Any files which AdwareMedic deems dangerous will automatically be marked for deletion.


You may want to check the items that are left unchecked. These are usually browser settings files that have been modified. Removing them will help guarantee that the adware is removed, but will also revert some of your browser settings in the process.

, All of the checked results will be removed and placed in a folder in your Trash.


You may be prompted for the administrator password when removing certain adware.
You may also be prompted to reboot your computer in order to complete the process.

, Sometimes, adware can make changes to the actual Firefox program. This isn't something that can be fixed by AdwareMedic, but it will notify you if it finds evidence. If this happens to you, it is highly recommended that you delete Firefox and redownload it from Mozilla., Safari doesn't have a browser reset option that removes extensions for you, so you'll have to do it all manually.

,,, The location varies depending on the version of Safari you are using.


Set the default search engine back to your preferred search engine.

Remove or Disable Java: Java is a massive security risk, especially when it is not updated correctly.,
Don’t Ignore or Disable the Firewall: If you’re using a version of Windows operating system, then your computer already has a firewall installed.,
Use Antivirus Protection:  The first step for ensuring that your computer is safe from security holes and other threats is simple: use an antivirus program.,
Install Software Updates:  Installing software updates can seem like a tedious process, however it’s important that you make sure all of your applications and programs are consistently kept up-to-date.,
Be Cautious and Proactive:  Use common sense and do your research!,
Use Unique Passwords:  Don’t reuse passwords and usernames.,
Avoid Pirated Files or “cracked” software - You can’t be sure of the downloads:  Another big security risk is using pirated origins, which has tampered with it, and whether or not it will install malware on your computer.

",How to Keep Your Sensitive Information Safe on the Computer," Because of the security holes regularly discovered and exploited, the program sees many updates and it’s very easy to neglect installing the latest version. Because it’s such a security risk even if properly updated, the best response is to simply disable Java from your system entirely. If you know that you need Java on your computer, make sure to disable the plug-in in your browser to help keep your files and system safe. You might also consider using the best antivirus program available to help keep your information safe.;
, Instead of disabling it, consider taking the time to correctly configure it: a correctly set up firewall is an effective tool against unwanted or unknown incoming network connections. This makes it very useful against threats like worms, which use un-patched security holes in applications and system services connected to the network to infect your computer.  Fortunately, it is very simple to correctly configure the Windows firewall. Simply select the correct answer from the choices of work, home, or public network when the option pops up (this tends to happen whenever you connect to a new network for the first time). Simply choosing the appropriate option helps ensure that unknown incoming network connections are blocked.

, While being careful about what links you click on and what sites you visit is a good idea, caution alone will not protect your computer from the latest vulnerabilities. Virus protection for your PC is an important addition to security that will help protect it against all threats, so consider using the best antivirus software you can find. Use antivirus software that rapidly adapts to the newest risks and helps keep your computer safe.

, Think of updates as improvements: software updates are typically released in order to fix known security risks, among other issues. Not installing the update leaves your system vulnerable to threats.  Consider allowing Windows Update to either install updates automatically, or to notify you of updates (which you should then install as soon as possible).

, The vast majority of system infections come from users installing untrusted and questionable software. If you’re contemplating installing a new program, take the time to investigate it beforehand: look around for reviews and ensure that you’re installing the software from its official website, not a third party site (it’s too easy for someone to upload malware instead of the program you’re interested in). If you ever do click on a download link anywhere other than the official website, make sure that the link hasn’t directed you to a different webpage.  Something else to watch out for is executables that install third-party software. These programs might contain a screen halfway through the install process that looks like a user agreement, but is actually the agreement to installing a random toolbar, for example. Third-party installations such as these can (and usually do) contain malware.

, If you use a single username and password combination for your various online accounts, you are putting yourself at risk. A single security leak at any one of those websites could mean that ALL of your accounts are at risk. If your username is your email address (or you use the same password for your email, too), then the situation is even more dire because now potential attackers can access your private email address (and use it to gain access to anything it’s linked to). Always use a unique password, at the very least, and make the password a secure one: consider using a password with both upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (such as @ * or!).

Understand what the ""hosts"" file does.,
Disable your antivirus.,
Find Notepad in the Start menu.,
Right-click on Notepad and select ""Run as administrator"".,
Open the ""hosts"" file in Notepad.,
Start a new line at the end of the file.,
Type .127.0.0.1 and press Space.,
Enter the website that you want to block after .127.0.0.1.,
Repeat for additional sites that you want to block.,
Save your changes and close the file.,
Make sure your administrator password is secure.",How to Block a Specific Website Without Software1," When you enter a website address in your browser, your computer contacts a domain name system (DNS) to determine what the actual IP address of the website is. This allows your browser to connect to the website. The ""hosts"" file allows you to override anything the DNS sends you. When you block a site using the ""hosts"" file, you're actually redirecting traffic to a blank page on your local computer.;
, Many antivirus programs prevent anything from making changes to the ""hosts"" so that viruses can't reroute you to different sites. You'll need to disable your antivirus for a few minutes while you make the necessary changes to the ""hosts"" file.


In Windows 8 and 10, you'll need to add the ""hosts"" file to the Windows Defender exclusions list. In these versions, Windows Defender will automatically revert your ""hosts"" files when it detects changes. Open the Windows Defender utility (search for it on the Start screen or menu), select ""Settings"", and find the ""Exclusions"" section. Add your ""hosts"" file to the exclusions (see the location in Step 5), but be aware that this leaves you a little more vulnerable to adware., You can find this in the ""Accessories"" category. If you're using Windows 8, you'll find it in the ""Windows Accessories"" category of the Apps screen.

, If you aren't logged in as an administrator, you'll be prompted for the administrator password. You'll need administrator access to change this file.

, Click ""File"" → ""Open"". Click the ""Text Documents"" drop-down box and select ""All Files"". Navigate to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc, changing C: to whatever drive letter you have Windows installed on. Select ""hosts"" to open it. If you don't see anything in the \etc folder, switch the view from text documents to all files.

, Place your cursor at the end of the last line and press ↵ Enter to start a new one.

, This tells the computer that the following website will instead load 127.0.0.1, which is a blank local page.

, You don't need to include the http:// part of the address. For example, if you wanted to block Twitter, the entire line would look like the following:


127.0.0.1 www.twitter.com

, You can add as many lines as you'd like. Just make sure that each line starts with 127.0.0.1.

, If you didn't close your antivirus, you may be prompted to confirm that you want to accept the changes. The websites that you listed will now be blocked for all users on that computer.

, Anyone with the administrator account can make changes to the ""hosts"" file. If everyone using your computer uses the same account to log in, the person you're blocking the websites for can easily change the file back. To prevent this from happening, each person should log in with their own standard account, and the administrator password should be unknown to anyone but you."

Your ""hosts"" file allows you to override the results of a DNS lookup. You can block websites using the ""hosts"" file by redirecting a website address to a blank page on your local computer.

, You'll need to use the Terminal utility to access the ""hosts"" file. You can find the Terminal in the Utilities folder.

, Enter your administrator password when prompted. You need administrator access in order to edit the ""hosts"" file. This command will open the ""hosts"" file in a text editor.

, You can add a new line for each website that you want to block

, This will tell your computer that the following website should be redirected to 127.0.0.1, which is a local blank page.

, You don't need to include the http:// part of the address. For example, to block YouTube type the following:


127.0.0.1 www.youtube.com

, You can reroute as many websites as you'd like to 127.0.0.1 by creating new lines for each. Make sure that each line starts with 127.0.0.1.

, Your changes will be saved and the file editor will be closed.

, This will clear the DNS cache and make the new rules take effect. You may need to enter your administrator password.

, Anyone that knows the administrator password can make changes to the ""hosts"" file. Make sure that each user logs into the Mac with a standard account, and that only you know the administrator password."

Log into your router's configuration page.,
Open the Security, Blocking, or Access Restrictions section.,
Enter websites or keywords to block.,
Set a schedule.,
Add exceptions.,
Change your administrator password.",How to Block a Specific Website Without Software3," Many routers allow you to block websites and create a schedule for the blocking, which can be more powerful than blocking the website for everyone all the time. This can allow you to set ""browsing times"", such as an hour for Facebook after dinner. Not all routers allow you to block sites, but most modern ones do.


You can access your router by typing the router's address into a networked computer's web browser. Most routers use 192.168.1.1 for their address, but some use 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.2.1. Refer to your router's documentation if you can't figure out the address.
You'll need to log in with your router's administrator account. Different routers have different default accounts, so refer to your documentation or look the model up online to find the default admin account.

, The label of this section will vary depending on the model router that you have. Some routers have this option in the Advanced section.

, You can enter specific websites, or enter keywords that you want to scan for. Block specific sites when you know what you're trying to block, and use keywords to block general subject matter. Click the Apply or Save button when you're finished.

, The scheduling options may be on the same page, or in a related section. Set the schedule to your specific needs. Blocks will apply to all connected devices by default. Click the Apply or Save button when you're finished.

, Many routers allow you to set a computer or device to be trusted, which will allow that computer to access any of the blocked sites. Enter the IP address of your private computer if you still want to be able to access the blocked sites. Your router's Devices section will tell you the IP address of each of your connected computers.

, If you leave the administrator password at the default settings, anyone on the network can look up the defaults and change your router configuration. If you want your blocking rules to be secure, change the router login information to something that only you know. You can find these options in the Administration section, which may be in the Advanced section.

First, consider the website you're surfing.,
Look at the title of the animation.,
Look for anything that requires you to turn the volume up and/or concentrate hard on an image.,
Turn off the sound.,
If you suspect it could be a trick, let it play but step away from your computer and turn the sound down.,
If it's on YouTube, look at the comments and see if anyone complains about the scare in the video.,
Also look at the tags of the video.,
Sometimes, if it's a video where they have a clock counting to new hour, it's going to be a screamer.

,
Ask a friend if they have seen it before.

,
Try to calm yourself before watching the video.,
As the video begins, play a song through your computer speakers.",How to Avoid Scary Pop Ups on Flash Animations over the Internet," If it's one that you've never seen before, don't take the risk.;
, If it looks like something boring or interesting, chances are it's a trick to scare you.(Note: some screamers have titles that say how to prevent screamers)

, It is usually a sign of a scary experience.

, If it does happen to be a ""shock flash"" animation, it will scream at you.

, Don't concentrate on it too much, it won't shock you this way.

, Also, look at the related videos. If it has a video of the car, any scary faces or pop-up video that you have seen, then it is a pop-up video.

, Some words just might give it away that it is a pop-up.

,,, The more you anticipate it the more scared you will be., Make sure the song is loud and is not itself scary, or else it will backfire, and you will end up even more scared. Place some breathable, translucent material over your face, like a sheer scarf. The material should really be translucent; too clear, and you might see the video; too opaque, and you won't be able to see if, while the video is playing, someone walks up to you with the obvious intention of giving you a good scare.

Install proxy software on your server.,
Analyze the IP address.,
Verify if the address is a static IP address.,
Search for the IP address in the CIDR.,
Block the proxy server from visiting your website.",How to Block Proxy Servers1," You can purchase and download the software from Internet. Using proxy software will save you money and time. You don’t have to worry about collecting a list of proxy servers. You may have to provide the software the URL address of the proxy server. The software will find the rest of the server’s information, and store it. The software will also likely have a feature in which you configure it to update the proxy list every week.;
, Use the software to help you to learn where the IP address is located. The software can give information, such as the type of protocol, proxy’s speed, country, and port number. You will be able to find out if the IP address is coming from a residential or business computer. If it’s a business computer, the software will let you know if its IP address is coming from an Internet service provider, proxy service, or a co-located server that’s located in a data center.

, A static IP address is a number that the Internet service provider permanently assigns a computer so that it can communicate with other computers via the Internet. If the IP address did not come from a co-location or is privately-owned, then it can be coming from a CIDR. CIDR, which stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, is a method to assign and identify the Internet addresses that are applied in inter-domain routing. This method is more flexible than the initial system of IP address classes. CIDRs can vary in size. Some can consist of thousands IP addresses, while others can be as small as four to eight IP addresses.

, Let the software detect if the IP address is bad.

, When the proxy server tries to access your website, you can have the software display a message, “Access Denied.”

Block proxy servers by HTTP protocols.",How to Block Proxy Servers2," If you don’t want to purchase software, there is another way. You can insert a script in your website’s root htsaccess file. It’s best to copy and paste the code, rather than type it. That way, you can be sure that you won’t make any errors. After you’ve inserted the code, upload it to your server. This method is effective. Insert the following code:
# block proxy servers from site access
# http://perishablepress.com/press/2008/04/20/how-to-block-proxy-servers-via-htaccess/
RewriteEngine on

Use a free service like Black Box Proxy Block to check if an IP address is associated with an open proxy server.

,
Other services such as BlockScript, BlockThatProxy, Maxmind and ThreatMetrix track all types of proxy servers, including Open proxies, HTTP proxies, SOCKS proxies, VPN (Virtual Private Network) servers, SSH tunnel servers, web-based proxies, popular anonymity networks, and Tor.

, Extract the downloaded file by opening it or dragging it to your Applications folder. Open the Tor Browser application, and leave it open for the rest of this method.


While the Tor Browser is the most secure way to browse the internet, it can also be used just as a connection to the Tor network. You'll need to have the Tor Browser open if you want to use Tor through any other browser, such as Firefox.

, The Tor network encrypts your requests for web pages and sends them through a network of private computers. To connect to this network through Firefox, you'll need to alter your Firefox proxy settings. This can vary depending on your Firefox version and operating system, but these instructions should work for most users:


In Firefox for Windows, go to Menu→Options→Advance→Network→Settings, or skip this process and use BlackBelt as described above.
In Firefox for Mac OS X, go to Firefox→Preferences→Advanced→Network→Settings.
In Firefox for Linux, go to Edit→Preferences→Advanced→Proxies.

, The default setting is ""No proxy."" Check the button next to ""Manual proxy configuration"" instead. Enter the following information exactly in the list of other options:

In the SOCKS Host box, enter: 127.0.0.1

In the Port box adjacent to the numbers you entered, type 9150.
Select SOCKS v5 if you see this option.
Place a checkmark in the ""Remote DNS"" box, if it isn't there already.
After No Proxy for:, enter 127.0.0.1


, Most likely, if the setup didn't work, you will not be able to load any web pages. If this happens, double check the information you added, and that the Tor Browser is open. If you are able to load web pages, visit check.torproject.org to confirm that you are using Tor.


If you cannot get Tor to work, switch back to ""No Proxy"" to continue using Firefox as normal while you troubleshoot the problem.

, If you cannot get Tor to work following these instructions, find your issue on the Tor FAQ. If your question is not answered there, contact the Tor Project developers through email, phone, or paper mail.


The developers can provide help in English, Arabic, Spanish, Farsi, French, or Mandarin.

, Anytime you want to use Tor, you must open the Tor Browser, wait for it to connect, then set Firefox to the ""manual proxy configuration"" you've set up. You will only be partially protected, but can increase your security by following the instructions below on becoming more secure.

, In 2013, the US National Security Agency exploited a flaw in Firefox version 17 to collect data sent through the Tor network.Check the changelog on a Firefox update to find out if it fixes an urgent security update. If it does not, consider waiting a week or two before updating, and check online to find out if the update introduced a new security flaw.

, Browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, and Quicktime can be exploited to reveal your IP address, identifying your computer.To get around this, you can try YouTube's experimental HTML5 video player, but most other sites will not have this option.


Many websites run these plugins automatically to show embedded content. You'll need to disable these plugins entirely in your Firefox plugin options for maximum privacy.

, Be aware that Torrent file-sharing applications often override your privacy settings, making it easy to track the download back to your computer. You may download other files normally, but turn off your internet connection before opening them to avoid the application transmitting data..doc and .pdf files are especially likely to contain internet resources.

, The http you see at the beginning of web addresses marks the protocol used to exchange requests for information between you and the web server. You may manually enter https instead to add an additional encrypted protocol, but installing the https everywhere add-on for Firefox is a much easier way to accomplish this, automatically forcing https on any website that supports the function.

, While the above steps can make your Firefox reasonably private, it is easy to slip up and reveal your information. Firefox also has a much more rapid development time than Tor does, so there is a significant chance that security flaws related to Firefox and Tor interactions will go undiscovered and unpatched. The Tor Browser, which you may have already downloaded while setting up Firefox Tor, automatically uses maximum privacy settings, and should be used when there are significant stakes involved, such as punishment from a repressive government.


The Tor Browser is a modified version of Firefox, so the layout and functionality may be fairly easy to learn.

Reset other browsers.This is the same no matter your operating system.,
Restart the computer.",How to Remove Mywebsearch," MyWebSearch is good at hiding from many anti-virus and anti-malware suites, but Malwarebytes Anti-Malwarecan find and destroy all of its elements on both Windows and Mac. Point your web browser to malwarebytes.org and click “Download.”


Windows users will then click “Download Free” to begin the download. When prompted to save the file, choose a location you’ll remember, like the desktop, and click “Save.”
Mac users, click the link next to “To protect your Mac, go here,” then click “Download.” Save the file to your desktop.
If you’re having trouble downloading software because of pop-up ads, use a different computer and save the software to a flash drive. Once the software is saved to the flash drive, plug it in to the infected computer and run the installer from there.;
,


Windows: double-click the installer on your desktop (called MBAM-setup), select a language when prompted, then click “Next.” Accept the agreement, click “Next” to choose an install location, then “Next” again to choose a name for the start menu shortcut. Click “Install.”
Mac users: double-click the installer (called MBAM-Mac) on your desktop, then drag the Malwarebytes icon to the Applications folder when prompted. Click “Open.” Type the admin password when asked, then click “Install Helper.”

, Launch Anti-Malware for the first time by double-clicking the icon created by the installer (in the Applications folder on Mac, in the programs menu or desktop for Windows).

, Anti-Malware knows to find Mywebsearch, so let’s make it happen. Click “Scan.”


Windows users, your scan will probably take several minutes, perhaps longer.
Mac users, this scan will be relatively fast, as there aren’t as many places for sketchy software to hide.

, Mywebsearch also installs other software on your computer, so if you see other things you don’t recognize, they might have come with MyWebSearch.

Put checks in the boxes next to everything that appears under “Threats” unless you know for sure that you trust that program. Some computer manufacturers, such as Lenovo, install harmless software that can be misidentified as adware/malware. Remove the checks next to entries that say the name of your computer manufacturer to protect those items. Other than that, if Malwarebytes Anti-Malware lists it as a threat, you can safely remove it. The following programs are all known to be affiliated with MyWebSearch and can be safely removed:

Mywebsearch Bar
Mywebsearch Smiley Central
Mywebsearch Outlook Express or Incredimail
My Way Speedbar Smiley Central
My Way Speedbar Yahoo or AOL
My Way Speedbar Outlook Express or Incredimail
Search Assistant My Way
Search Assistant Mywebsearch
Fun Web Products Easy Installer
Weatherbug


If other items you don’t recognize appear, make sure they are also checked.
Click “Remove Selected” to remove all checked options from your computer.

, Once the programs have been remove, restart your computer and log back in.

, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware does a great job at removing Mywebsearch on its own, but you may need to make some tweaks to regain control of your web browser. If opening your browser brought you to the MyWebSearch site, read on. If you no longer see the MyWebSearch toolbar and you’re brought to your normal homepage, you’re done!

, Even if you don't use Internet Explorer (IE) regularly, you'll want to reset it to clear out any settings that MyWebSearch changed. While this does reset your browser settings (such as search engines and homepage preference), your personal data will be unaffected:


Open the IE Tools menu (or the Gear button) and select ""Internet options.""
Click the ""Advanced"" tab and then click ""Reset."" Check ""Delete personal settings"" and then click ""Reset.""

, Resetting your web browser won’t touch your saved passwords or bookmarks, but you’ll have to install any additional toolbars or browser extensions you use (such as ad blockers) when you’re done. Make sure you do this on every browser on your computer, not just the one you use most.


Chrome: Click the Menu (☰) button and select ""Settings."" Click the ""Show advanced settings"" link at the bottom of the screen, then ""Reset settings."" Click ""Reset"" to confirm.
Firefox: Click the Menu (☰) button and select ""?"" Click ""Troubleshooting Information,” then click ""Refresh Firefox."" Click ""Refresh Firefox"" again to confirm.
Safari: In the Safari menu, click “Reset Safari,” then “Reset” to confirm the change.

, Once you’ve restarted the computer, MyWebSearch should be completely removed from your computer. To verify, run another Malwarebytes scan and wait for the results.


If your computer is infected with other adware or malware, you may have to take additional steps to remove those threats.

Firefox 9 and earlier does not have the Inspect Element tool at all.;
, You can right-click on images, text, backgrounds, or any other element. If you don't have a two-button mouse, left-click while holding Control.

, A toolbar should appear at the bottom of your window. A pane will also appear below the toolbar, displaying the page's HTML code.

, When you click Inspect Element, several panes will open at the bottom of your window. Here's a breakdown of their uses and names:The top row is the Toolbox Toolbar. This has several developer tools, but we're interested in Inspector on the left. Keep this selected (highlighted in blue) for this entire guide.
Below the toolbar, there's a single Breadcrumbs row of HTML elements, showing the full path relating to the selected element.
The pane below this row shows the HTML tree or ""Markup View"" of the page. The HTML for the element you selected is highlighted and centered in this pane.
The pane to the right displays the CSS stylesheet for this page.

, Once the toolbar is open, selecting another element is easy. Here are three ways to do it:


Hover over a line of HTML to highlight the corresponding element (requires Firefox 34+).Click the HTML to select that element.
Click the Select Element tool on the far left of the toolbar: the icon is a cursor over a square. Move your cursor over the page to highlight elements, then click to select an element.

, Click anywhere in the HTML pane. Use the left and right arrows on your keyboard to move through the code (requires Firefox 39+).This is useful for elements too small to select by hand.


Grey HTML relates to elements not displayed on the page. This includes comments, certain nodes such as <head>, and elements that have been hidden with the CSS display property.Click the arrow to the left of containers to expand or hide its contents. To expand all contents, hold Alt or option while clicking., Look for the search bar (magnifying glass icon) on the far right of the Breadcrumbs row. Click this to expand it, then type in the HTML code you're looking for. As you type, a popup will appear listing matching elements. Click on one to select that element and scroll the HTML pane to its code.

, If you're new to web developer tools, understand that they do not make any permanent changes. Your edits will only be visible on your screen, and only until your close the page or refresh it. Don't hesitate to experiment even if you're not sure what will happen.

, Double click a line of HTML. Type in the new text and press enter to save your changes.

, Remember, the Breadcrumb toolbar is sandwiched between the full HTML tree and the upper toolbar. Click and hold on any of the elements in this row to open an extensive menu. Here's an incomplete guide to these options:""Edit as HTML"" makes the node and all its contents editable in the HTML tree, instead of having to edit each line individually.
""Copy Inner HTML"" copies all the contents of the node, while ""Copy Outer HTML"" copies the node as well (such as <div> or <body>
""Paste →"" leads to several options for where to paste, such as before this node or after the first child of the node.
 :hover, :active, and :focus change the appearance of the element when the user interacts with it. The exact effect is determined by the CSS stylesheet (editable from the right hand pane).

, To rearrange elements in the code, click and hold the HTML until a dashed line appears. Move it up or down the tree and let go when the dashed line is in the desired place.


This requires Firefox 39 or later., To close all of these fancy windows, just press the X in the far right corner of the toolbar, above the CSS pane.

Browse the internet normally.",How to Work Offline in Mozilla Firefox," Offline Mode removes Firefox's connection to the internet, instead fetching all information from the browser cache. While online, Firefox will automatically save websites you browse as cached web content. These cached versions of the sites can be accessed when offline, but additional browsing beyond the saved content is not possible (i.e. you can navigate to any site you previously visited, but any links on that site that are not already cached will return an error. Likewise, even if connectivity is restored, Offline Mode must be disabled to resume browsing non-cached sites).


The storage size of the cache is limited. As a user browses, older content is removed from the cache and replaced with the most recent. By default, Firefox stores a cache of 350MB. This is a solid amount of web content, but if you want more (or less), you can edit the cache size by going to “☰ > Options > Advanced > Network” and selecting “Override automatic cache management”. This will allow you manually set the cache size.;

, As you begin typing in the address bar, Firefox will suggest pages based on your browsing history and bookmarked pages. If and when your desired destination appears, simply click on it. You can also perform searches from the address bar instead of using the smaller search bar.

There are several ways you can adjust settings for autofill.To delete a specific form entry from Firefox's history, click on the form field in question and press ↓. Then highlight the entry you want to delete and press ⇧ Shift+Del.
To delete all of your form history, begin by clicking on the menu button with three horizontal lines. Then click History and ""Clear Recent History...""

Download Firefox ESR or Firefox 51.,
Turn off updates to Firefox 51 immediately and turn off updates to Firefox ESR in 2018.,
Prevent overwriting one version with another, if you already use Firefox.,
Take extra steps to prevent Firefox 51 or ESR from updating if you also run a current version of Firefox.,
Deal with any Firefox extension problems.,
Consider creating a separate profile for use with Firefox ESR or 51.",How to Use Firefox ESR or Firefox 51 to Access Websites Requiring Silverlight or Java,"

You can download Firefox ESR or 51 from Mozilla's official repository of all Firefox releases https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/

Firefox ESR is also available at https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/npapi-plugins along with more information about the timeline for NPAPI plugin support phaseout
Mozilla's official advice regarding downgrading is available at https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-older-version-of-firefox As of May 30, 2017, that page also contained a link to Firefox 51
Firefox ESR receives security updates. Firefox 51 will become increasingly less secure, so should only be used at safe sites requiring plugins.
Mozilla also indicates that the Windows 64-bit version of Firefox 52 ESR supports only Flash and Silverlight, so if you need Java or other plugins, you need to download the 32-bit version
You might be able to get Java to work in your current version of Firefox (without downgrading). Follow Mozilla's directions at https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-allow-java-trusted-sites. Try closing and relaunching Firefox if simply whitelisting a site in the Java Control Panel's Security section doesn't allow the applet to run.;
, This is easy if you don't have Firefox on your computer now and have no plans to use Firefox other than at sites requiring plugins.

You can simply install Firefox 51 and set its preferences to Preferences > Advanced > Update > Never check for updates.
Alternatively, you can install Firefox ESR, set its updating preferences to ""Check for updates, but let you choose whether to install them"" and stop installing updates in 2018.

, It is possible to keep multiple versions of Firefox on your computer, but you will need to take steps to prevent overwriting one version with another.

You can temporarily rename your current version of Firefox to ""FirefoxCurrent"" or some such, install Firefox 51, rename that to ""Firefox51,"" and then reset the name of FirefoxCurrent to Firefox.
Or you can simply install Firefox 51 in a different folder/directory than the one containing the current version of Firefox.

, Preventing Firefox 51 or in 2018, Firefox ESR from updating to the current version is more complicated if you have a current version of Firefox on the same computer. Updating behavior is controlled by settings in your Firefox user profile. If you have multiple versions of Firefox on your computer but only one user profile, all versions of Firefox on your computer will use the same profile. If you normally set Firefox to automatically install updates, Firefox 51 will update itself to the current version on launch. To prevent that from happening.

You can create another profile to be used exclusively when using Firefox 51 or ESR and set its preferences to ""Never check for updates."" Or you can:

Launch your current version of Firefox. Set your update preferences to Preferences > Advanced > Update > then either ""Check for updates, but let you choose whether to install them"" or ""Never check for updates"".
Quit the current version of Firefox.
Launch Firefox 51 and navigate to the plugin-requiring website.
When you are done with Firefox 51, you can choose to:

Launch the current version of Firefox and reset the preferences to ""Automatically install updates."" You will have reset the preferences to ""Never update"" before relaunching Firefox 51 if you choose this option.
Or you can leave your update preferences as ""Check for updates, but let you choose whether to install them."" If you pick this option, you need to be careful that you don't accidentally install updates when launching Firefox 51.





, If you have Firefox extensions, Firefox ESR and 51 may warn you that one or more extensions won't work and have been disabled. This happens if you update an extension in your current version of Firefox and it doesn't work in the older browsers. It's likely you can ignore the error messages, because there's a good chance you don't need those extensions for limited work at a handful of websites and the extensions will be re-enabled when you launch the current version of Firefox., This can be helpful if you have multiple Firefox versions on your computer.

Firefox stores an individual user's information in a profile. Information in the profile includes things like preferences, extensions, history and bookmarks. You can use Mozilla's Profile Manager to create multiple profiles so that different users can each have his/her own profile. Profile Manager can also create a separate profile with preferences set to ""Never check for updates"" and free of any extensions that don't work in the older browser; if you use this profile whenever you launch the older browser, the older browser will not update itself and you will not be bothered by extension-related error messages.
If you launch the Profile Manager by following Mozilla's official directions , the Firefox Choose User Profile dialog box will appear whenever you launch Firefox unless you check the box ""Don't ask at startup."" If you think you will be navigating to plugin-requiring sites frequently and don't mind having the ""Choose User Profile"" box show up every time you launch Firefox, you may want to leave the ""Don't ask at startup"" unchecked. If you think that you will be using the older Firefox versions infrequently and don't mind launching Profile Manager according to Mozilla's directions in the references, you may want to check the ""Don't ask at startup"" box. Checking ""Don't ask at startup"" will cause Firefox to start with the last profile used.

Reset Firefox.",How to Stop Firefox from Consuming CPU Cycles2," Visit https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/plugincheck/ to check the status of your plugins. If you see any Update Now buttons, click them and wait for them to update. Restart Firefox once finished. Plugins can increase CPU usage when you view videos, PDFs, or other media.

, Once all of your plugins are up to date, testing them is pretty easy:


Visit the Plugins tab of the Add-Ons manager.
Click each drop-down menu that says ""Always Activate"" and set it to ""Ask to Activate"" instead.
Browse as usual. You will see a small popup every time a plugin asks to be activated. If you say ""Yes"" and your CPU usage rises, that plugin is the problem.
When the problem is identified, look for alternative plugins for the same format. If there are none, leave that plugin in ""Ask to Activate"" mode.

, One solution is to block media you don't want to see in the first place. Try these extensions:


If Flash causes the problem, install Flashblock.
If JavaScript causes issues, install NoScript. This will take some hands-on effort at first to disable problematic scripts one by one.
For a generally lower CPU load, install Adblock Plus or another ad blocker.

, If all else fails, return your Firefox to default state. This will permanently delete your add-ons, but most preferences and bookmarks should remain unchanged. To do this, return to about:support and click Refresh Firefox.


You may want to try the other issues below before you resort to this. If Safe Mode fixed your issue, however, add-ons are almost certainly the problem.

Change your Firefox version.,
Remove malware from your computer.,
Disable Windows compatibility mode.,
Toggle hardware acceleration.,
Toggle hardware acceleration for Flash videos.,
Disable WebGL.",How to Stop Firefox from Consuming CPU Cycles3," Check your Firefox version to automatically update to the latest version. If you've already updated, download the Firefox Beta instead. The Beta includes in-progress bug fixes that have not yet made it to regular Firefox.


Reverting to older versions of Firefox is not recommended. They may have security risks.

, If you see popups and other ads on every web page, your computer is infected with malware. Even if there are no obvious signs, running an antivirus scan is recommended. Malicious software may have accessed your CPU.

, If you are on Windows, right-click the Firefox icon on your desktop. Select Properties, then the Compatibility tab. If the checkbox underneath Compatibility Mode is checked, uncheck it and restart Firefox., Hardware acceleration assigns your graphical processing unit some of the hard work, theoretically freeing up your CPU. This generally works as intended on Firefox, but it can backfire on certain websites or on computers with an older OS or graphics card.Try a day with hardware acceleration and a day without, to compare the effect:


Enter about:preferences#advanced in the Firefox address bar, or click the menu icon (three lines), then Preferences, then the Advanced tab.
Check or uncheck ""Use hardware acceleration when available.""
Restart Firefox., Your Flash player may use hardware acceleration even if Firefox has disabled it. Right-click on a Flash video and select Settings. Click the far left tab (Display) and check or uncheck ""Enable hardware acceleration.""Adjust this to match your Firefox setting.


Some video hosts now use an HTML5 player instead of Flash. This should adjust correctly to your Firefox settings.

, WebGL is a similar hardware acceleration technology, mostly used for graphic-intensive uses like 3D browser games. It has been known to consume CPU cycles in the past, but these problems are rare in modern Firefox. You could try disabling it just in case:Enter about:config in the address bar. As the warning says, you should not change any settings here without knowing what you're doing.
Search for webgl.disabled. (Don't confuse this with other similar settings.)
Double-click that row to change the value to True.

, At this point, your anti-virus will let you choose what sort of scan you want it to perform:


You can opt for a “Quick scan,” which usually takes a short amount of time and is less thorough but generally gets the job done.
If you want a more thorough scan, you can choose “Complete scan” to really let the program take its time to look for threats.

, After you’ve selected the scan option, click “Start” to begin scanning for viruses.

, Most anti-viruses will provide you a list of potential and actual threats either in real time or after the scan has completed.

, Once your software has finished the scan, it will let you decide what to do with the threats. Look through the list it provides you, and see if it falsely detected a program that you know for sure is not a virus.


False detection can sometimes occur with programs that do processes that normal programs don’t normally do. It is called a false positive when this occurs.

, Right-click the false positives and choose to add it to the anti-virus exceptions from the options.

You can download it for free here. If you are having difficulties using your browser, try downloading the program on another computer and then transferring it via USB drive.;
, When you first start AdwCleaner, Windows will likely warn you that it is an unknown program. Proceed with running AdwCleaner. AdwCleaner will download a few files before it begins.


If Windows SmartScreen prevents you from starting the program, click ""More info"" and then select ""Run anyway"".

, AdwCleaner will begin scanning for malware infections. The scanning process will likely take around 15 minutes.

, This will remove any infected files that AdwCleaner found during the scan. You will be prompted to save any open documents, as AdwCleaner will close any open programs to help remove infected files.

, After AdwCleaner is finished removing infected files, reboot your computer and move on to the next section.

, Arabyonline will modify some or all of your browser shortcuts to include a link to the Arabyonline homepage. This will force your browser to load this page every time you use the shortcut. You'll need to manually remove the links from every shortcut that you use. Browser shortcuts are often located in the Start menu, on the desktop, and in the taskbar. Make sure you locate shortcuts for all of the browsers that you use.

, This should open the Properties window to the Shortcut tab.


If you're trying to open the Properties window for a taskbar shortcut, right-click the taskbar shortcut and then right-click the program name to see the ""Properties"" option.

, This is the location of the program that the shortcut points to in order to open the program.

, If the shortcut is infected, you'll see ""http://arabyonline.com"" at the end of the Target field. Remove the entire address from the field, but don't touch the actual program location or the shortcut won't work.


, Check your desktop, taskbar, and Start menu or screen. Forgetting even one shortcut can undo the whole process when you accidentally use it.

, This is one of the most comprehensive antimalware programs available, and it is free for home users. You can download it from malwarebytes.org. Run the installer after downloading it to install the program. You don't need to enable the premium trial during installation.


Malwarebytes Antimalware can run alongside your regular antivirus software.

, When you first start the program, you'll be prompted to check for updates. Make sure to download these updates before proceeding with the scan.

, Click the ""Scan Now"" on the main window to begin scanning your computer. You can also click the ""Scan"" tab, select ""Threat Scan"", and then click the ""Scan Now"". The scanning process will take about 20-30 minutes.


If you haven't updated yet, you'll be prompted to again before the scan begins.

, After the scan has completed, you'll see a list of infected objects found. Click the ""Quarantine All"" and then ""Apply Actions"" to quarantine all of the infected files so that they can no longer affect your computer.

, Malwarebytes Antimalware may need to reboot to finish the removal. Even if you aren't prompted to, it's generally good practice to reboot after a malware scan.

, After rebooting, run a scan again with AdwCleaner and again with Antimalware. Lingering files may still cause problems, and a second scan by both programs can help ensure that the infection stays gone.

, This is a malware scanner that you can use for free for thirty days. You'll just be using it for the removal of Arabyonline, so you don't need to worry about the thirty day trial. You can download it from surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro.

, On the second screen, select ""No, I only want to perform a one-time scan to check this computer"". This option will not install the HitmanPro files to your computer.

, HitmanPro will begin scanning your computer immediately. The scanning process will likely take less than five minutes. Click ""Next"" after the scan is complete.

, This will start your thirty day trial and remove any files that were found during the scan.

, Even if you don't use Internet Explorer, it's still a good idea to reset it since Windows relies on it a lot. Resetting Internet Explorer will remove any malicious extensions and reset your home page and settings.


Click the Tools menu or Gear button and select ""Internet options"".
Click the ""Advanced"" tab and click Reset....
Confirm that you want to reset Internet Explorer. You'll need to restart Internet Explorer after resetting it.

, If you have Chrome installed as your browser, you'll need to reset it to remove all traces of Arabyonline.


Click the Chrome Menu button (☰) and select Settings.
Click the ""Show advanced settings"" link and scroll to the bottom.
Click the Reset settings button. Confirm that you want to reset Chrome.

, If Firefox is your primary browser, it may need to be reset. This will remove any extensions and reset your settings.


Click the Firefox Menu button (☰) and click the ""?"" button at the bottom of the menu.
Select ""Troubleshooting Information"". You can also type about:support into the URL box to access this page.
Click Refresh Firefox... and then confirm that you want to reset Firefox.

, If you are using a different web browser, you'll need to reset it as well. Most browsers have a similar process to one of the three steps above. Refer to the browser's support website if you need instructions on resetting the browser., If you've performed all of the steps in each of the sections above and Arabyonline is still appearing, you'll need to use this section to reset your DNS. This section is not required for everyone; most users will see their systems back to normal at the end of the previous section., This is a network utility developed by Bleeping Computer, a major antimalware community. You can download it from here. Select the EXE version and download it to your desktop.

, Right-click on the downloaded EXE file and select ""Run as administrator"". If Windows SmartScreen blocks it, select ""More info"" and then click ""Run anyway"".

, Enter the following script into the main console of Zoek. This script will reset your DNS settings:


createsrpoint;
autoclean;
emptyalltemp;
ipconfig /flushdns;b

, The process will likely take a few minutes to complete. You'll be asked to reboot once the script has finished running., When you download a free program, it will often come bundled with additional software. If you select an ""Express"" or ""Default"" installation, or don't pay attention to each screen, you'll often be giving consent to install this additional software that you didn't want. Always select a ""Custom"" installation and read each screen carefully. You'll almost always be given the option to opt out if you read each installation screen.

, Freeware programs are often scooped up by larger download sites and then packaged with their own installer. These installers bundle additional software with the program you want. While these are usually the first sites that come up in a Google search, you'll be better off finding the website of the actual developer. You'll often be able to get an installer that doesn't come bundled with anything else. This also allows the developer to better track their downloads, which supports their development.


Another benefit of downloading directly from the developer is that you'll be getting the latest version of the program. Large download sites often have out-of-date versions of the software available, since many smaller programs update quite frequently.

, If you download a lot of programs, it's a good idea to run regular scans with the tools outlined in the sections above. These programs will keep your browsers running smoothly and prevent infections from taking root.

Test your computer.",How to Remove a Virus1," Before starting the virus removal process, make sure that all of your important data is backed up. This will ensure that nothing of value is lost if the computer has to be completely reformatted, and you can get back up and running with minimal time invested.


See this guide for detailed instructions on how to back up all of your important data.;
, Oftentimes a slow computer will give the impression that it is infected with a virus, when it may be an issue with memory, storage, adware, or a number of other factors. Failing hardware, especially hard drives, can significantly slow down your computer and corrupt files.



This guide contains a variety of tips to help speed up a slow computer.

, You should already have an antivirus program installed, but if you don't there are a variety of both free and commercial products are available. Most paid programs have a trial period that will allow you to scan and remove viruses, so don't worry about cost and download the program that sounds the best to you. Popular options include Kaspersky, BitDefender, Avira, and Trend Micro. You should only have one of these installed at a time.


You will also need a few anti-malware programs. While lots of adware is technically legitimate, lots of it is shady as well. These programs may pick up things that your antivirus passes over. Popular options include Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and Hitman pro. Like antivirus programs, you should not have too many anti malware programs as they may slow down your PC, but unlike antivirus programs it is an option.
If your virus infection is preventing you from successfully downloading files, you will need to download them on another computer and transfer them via USB drive.

, In order for a virus to do anything, it needs to be run. Most viruses run themselves by attaching to startup services that load when Windows loads. Safe Mode only loads the most essential files for Windows to run, which should stop almost all viruses from starting. This will allow you to identify and remove them., Run a full system scan with your antivirus program. Quarantine anything that doesn't look right after the scan is complete (most antivirus programs have a quarantine function). After you are finished running the virus scan, run each of your additional anti-malware scans. Each program is capable of removing any infections it is able to find., After the scans have all completed, reboot normally and test your computer's performance. Run your web browser and any other programs that you originally had issues with. If your infection is gone, you're done! If problems persist, read on to the next section.

Check your state's law.,
Collect your information.,
Consider hiring an attorney.,
Contact law enforcement.,
Provide information about the incident and the person who is blackmailing you.,
Cooperate with any continuing investigation.,
Consider getting a restraining order.",How to Prove Blackmail," While the basic elements of blackmail are generally the same nationwide, each state differs in how the crime is classified and the punishment for conviction.


For example, some states such as Kansas treat blackmail as a crime against the person, similar to assault, while in others such as California blackmail is a type of theft.Generally, a blackmailer attempts to coerce you into paying him money or doing something you wouldn't normally do by threatening to reveal harmful or damaging information that you've kept secret unless you comply with his demands.A blackmailer also may threaten to harm you or someone you love unless you pay her money or do something for her. However, proving blackmail requires proof that the blackmailer's intent in threatening you was to get money or something else valuable that you otherwise would not give to him freely.Some states recognize the threat itself as an independent crime, such that the blackmailer can be punished for threatening you, even if you have no proof that the purpose of the threat was to gain money or some other item of value from you.Blackmail victims pay the money to avoid the threatened action.However, keep in mind that paying a blackmailer off is no guarantee that he won't do whatever he was threatening to do anyway. Additionally, the blackmailer may come back in the future and ask for more money to continue to keep the information he has secret.In some states the crime is called extortion if it involves the acts of a public official, while blackmail deals with private individuals. For example, if the mayor of a town in one of these states told you he would block your business's license unless you agreed to pay money to sponsor the city's baseball team, that would be extortion rather than blackmail.;
, Before you file a police report, take a moment to compile the facts of your case and make copies of any correspondence or other recordings that might be used as evidence of the crime.


You might consider writing a brief account of the events that took place or the facts involved in the blackmail. You can provide this statement to police. A single statement may come in handy particularly if you are contacting more than one law enforcement agency, because you can ensure that each agency has exactly the same information.
Keep in mind that the prosecutor will have to prove the elements of the crime you've just researched. Any information that relates to one of those elements is potentially evidence that can be used against the person blackmailing you., Especially if the information would be extremely damaging to you if revealed, you may need legal representation to protect your rights and interests.


For example, if someone is threatening to turn you into police for a crime you didn't commit, you should consider hiring an attorney long before the person actually follows through with her threat.
An experienced criminal defense attorney will be able to assess your case and advise you on the best way to proceed under the circumstances. He or she also can analyze the evidence you have and tell you whether it would be admissible in a court of law, as well as the probability of either arrest or conviction., Although you can simply go to the police or sheriff's department nearest you, you may choose a different location depending on where the person blackmailing you lives.


If interstate commerce is involved in the crime, it may be charged as a federal offense. In that case, you would want to contact the FBI.For example, when hackers published a list of the registered users of a website for extra-marital affairs, blackmailers emailed them claiming they would send messages to the user's family and friends alerting them to the user's account unless the user paid them a certain sum in Bitcoins.If someone is blackmailing you over the internet, you can file an internet crime complaint at http://www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx. The Internet Crime Complaint Center will review your complaint and forward the information to the appropriate law enforcement agencies., Provide as much detail as possible along with copies of any correspondence you've received.


To file criminal charges, the police must first have information sufficient to provide probable cause to arrest the person blackmailing you.For this reason, it's important to include as many details as possible.
Typically, you will need to provide information about yourself, including your name and address, as well as any similar information you know about your blackmailer. You also should relate all the details you can about the incident, including the blackmailer's statements or actions and your response.When the officer has finished taking your statement and completed the police report, make sure you get a copy for your records. Make note of the report or reference number in case you need to add or update information.

, The investigating officer or prosecuting attorney may contact you if they have further questions, or if an arrest has been made.


In some cases, criminal investigators may ask you to continue communication with the person blackmailing you or pretend to do what he wants so they have an opportunity to arrest the person.
Keep in mind that even if the person is arrested, the prosecutor still has relatively broad discretion in deciding whether to file criminal charges. Typically prosecutors only file charges if they believe they can prove the suspect is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt., If the person blackmailing you has physically harmed you or is threatening your safety, a restraining order can keep him or her away from you.


Courts have forms available at the clerk's office that you can fill out to ask for a restraining order. You must include the name and location of the person as well as details about the threats he or she is making.In many states you cannot get a restraining order unless you know or have a relationship with the person. However, a few states have a different order, typically called a civil harassment order, that you can request regardless of your relationship to the person.When you go to the courthouse to fill out the forms to get a restraining order, you typically will be issued a temporary restraining order. That order will keep the person away from you and places you frequent such as your home or place of work until a hearing can be held for a permanent restraining order.The person you want to have restrained must be served with the forms you filled out and filed with the court. Then there will be a hearing, when both you and the other person have the opportunity to present your cases. A judge will listen to both sides, consider the evidence, and decide whether to make your restraining order permanent."

Download Autoruns.,
Adjust Autoruns' options.,
Reboot into Safe Mode with Networking.,
Start the Autoruns program.,
Begin searching for suspicious entries.,
Delete the first malware-related entry.,
Remove the files associated with the deleted entry.,
Reboot your computer normally.,
Consider reinstalling Windows.",How to Remove a Virus2," Autoruns is a program from Microsoft TechNet that allows you to see exactly what is starting up each time your computer boots. This will give you the clearest possible picture about what is currently operating on your computer.


After downloading, extract the program to an easy to access spot, such as C:\Autoruns.
Run the program before continuing to get a feel for how it is laid out, and to see how it displays the services and programs that are starting up with Windows. It's a pretty daunting display at first, but you will only need to focus on a few areas later on.

, In order to make it easier to find infected entries, you will want to disable reporting of certain signed Microsoft services, and include locations that might not normally be checked. Click the Options menu and then select Filter Options. Check the following boxes:


Include empty locations
Verify code signatures
Hide signed Microsoft entries

, Since most viruses attach themselves to startup services, deleting the service while the virus is running will allow it to recreate the entry in your registry. Safe Mode will only load essential startup services, allowing you to safely disable infected ones.


Rebooting into ""Safe Mode with Networking"" as opposed to ""Safe Mode"" will allow you to use the internet to look up the programs that are starting with your computer.

, Once you have entered Safe Mode, start the Autoruns program. Double-check that your Filter Options are set correctly. Wait for the scan to finish, which may take a few moments.

, This will be the most tedious part of the process, as you'll want to look up any suspicious entry online to see if the process is legitimate or not. You will need to pay attention to both the entry's name and the file location.


There are a variety of process identifiers online that can tell you exactly what the process is and if it's a potential threat. Some popular databases include Process Library, Bleeping Computer, and File.net.
Focus on the Logon and Services tabs. There are a variety of tabs that help filter information for you, but most of the time you'll find what you're looking for in the Logon and Services tabs. You shouldn't ignore the others, though, as some viruses will be reported in other areas.
Take your time when investigating processes. Disabling real processes can keep Windows from loading properly, so triple-check each process before you mark it for removal.
Record the file location of each offending entry before you remove it. You will need to locate these files later to delete them.

, Once you've identified entries that are infected, you can delete the first one by right-clicking on it and selecting Delete. This will remove the entry from your startup process, but doesn't delete any of the infected files.


Delete entries one at a time, delete the associated files, and then repeat for the next entry. This will help to ensure that you don't forget to remove files from your computer.

, Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the location that was associated with the startup entry. If you can't see the files, you may need to reveal hidden files.


Repeat the entry and file removal steps for each entry you need to get rid of.

, Once you have finished removing each of the entries and all of the infected files, you can reboot your computer normally, allowing all the remaining processes to start. This should eliminate the majority of common virus infections. If you are still infected, see the next step.

, If you can't seem to get rid of the infection, reinstalling Windows may be your best bet. Although it seems like an extreme step, it is actually usually faster to reinstall than to continue trying to troubleshoot a stubborn infection, and much cheaper than taking your computer to a professional. Chances are you use fewer programs than you might think, making your reinstallation time even quicker.


Reinstalling will wipe your hard drive clean, removing virtually any virus infection.
Before reinstalling, make sure that you have all of your important data backed up and your Windows key handy. You may also want to put the installers of all your essential programs such as browser and antivirus onto a USB drive for easy access after the Windows reinstallation is complete."

Install a Mac-specific antivirus program.,
Scan for viruses.,
Scan with a second program.,
Reinstall OS X.,
Remove the Flashback virus.,
Remove the FBI Mac OS X virus (MoneyPak).",How to Remove a Virus3," The days of not needing an antivirus program for Mac computers are over. As the operating system has gained popularity, so has the frequency of virus infections. Virus makers now see Macs as valid targets, and ensuring you are protected is the best way to prevent viruses. Antivirus scanners are also the easiest way to get rid of existing viruses.


Popular Mac antivirus programs include Sophos, ClamXav, Intego VirusBarrier, as well as paid products from the big names, including Norton, McAfee and Kaspersky.
Make sure you only have one anti-virus program installed at a time.

, Use your newly-installed scanner to check your computer for viruses. Ensure that you are scanning any connected external hard drives or USB drives as well.


Macs can transmit PC viruses as well, even if they aren't susceptible to them.
Remove any offending results from your antivirus scan. Mac viruses are typically much easier to remove using a virus scanner than PC viruses.

, After scanning with your first antivirus program, uninstall it and install a second program. You can use two different free programs for this, or one free and one paid. Running a second scan will help catch malware that slipped through the cracks of the first scan.

, If you have a virus infection that scans simply won't get rid of, reinstalling your operating system may be your best bet. If you already have your data backed up, it actually won't even take that long, and may improve your system's performance as well.


See this guide for detailed instructions on reinstalling OS X.

, This virus was one of the first big virus scares for OS X users. Apple has since patched OS X to fix the security exploit and remove the malware from OS X systems, but if you haven't kept OS X up to date you may not have this fix.


There are several programs that you can download that will remove Flashback, including F-Secure's Flashback Removal Tool.

, This piece of malware hijacks your browser, forcing you to a page that claims your computer has been shut down by the FBI. The site claims that by paying a large sum of money, your computer can be unlocked. You can remove this virus by resetting Safari's settings.


Open Safari and click the Safari menu in the menubar.
Click ""Reset Safari...""
Make sure every item in the list is checked.

Look for the following.",How to Recognize Spambots," You can refer to your favorite search engine.


Intelligent spam programs attempt to interpret what you say to the account they are using and make a response that seems relative to what you said. When the account you suspect is a computer program always makes very vague, generic responses (like horoscopes, responses that would cover a wide range of things) the account is likely being run by a program. Don't jump to conclusions though, as it may just be a user who has nothing to contribute (if that's any better).
Spam programs will sometimes answer questions that were never asked. For example, a 'user' may suddenly just post ""Yes, I agree. You should keep doing what you're doing."", without anyone ever having argued or asked a question.
Some spam programs may spontaneously state something they 'like'. An example of this would be a group of users having a conversation about computer security, and another 'user' suddenly says ""I love the latest Croc sandals. I bought them at crocsandalscheap.com for a good price!""
Spam programs will never really participate in a conversation or directly talk to another user. This is because conversation between humans is really difficult to emulate and design an algorithm for. So the program's design prevents it from being obvious through making comments every now and then.

, Select Sidebar, and then Bookmarks.


A sidebar will appear on the left of the Firefox window.
You will see at least 3 icons there: Bookmarks Toolbar, Bookmarks Menu, and Unsorted Bookmarks .
The Bookmarks Toolbar is the strip across the top, underneath the address bar. Use that for websites you go to constantly, so you never have to dig for them.
The Bookmarks Menu is what you see when you click on the Bookmarks menu, and is probably where most of your current bookmarks are.

, This will make it easy to get where you often go to, quickly and without fuss.


From the bookmarks you've collected, drag the top 5 bookmarks into the Bookmarks Toolbar folder. You can add more if you like, but the most efficient way to use the Bookmarks Toolbar is to keep it limited to those sites you visit regularly.
Add folders to the Bookmarks Toolbar. If you frequently visit a number of related sites, rather than using up the toolbar space for every site, put them all in a Bookmark folder, and drag that to your Bookmarks Toolbar folder.
The menu option Open All in Tabs will open all the bookmarks in that folder at one time, in separate tabs.

, To organize the rest of your bookmarks, we need to create a filing system. Chances are, while you may have dozens of bookmarks, you have a much smaller number of categories for those bookmarks. We'll create those next, in the Bookmarks Menu folder. Some possibilities for your category folder names are:


Entertainment
News
Computers
Kids
Shopping
Tools
Sports
Travel

, Right-click on the Bookmarks Menu folder (or Control-click). From the contextual menu, select New Folder...

, In the New Folder window, type a name for the folder, and if you like, a description or memo of what's inside. The new folder will appear in the sidebar inside the folder you clicked on to create it.


Repeat this procedure until you have what you think will be a good start to your bookmark filing system. Remember, you can always add more!

, Now comes the process of sorting through your stacks of bookmarks, and deciding what goes where.


Should you come across a bookmark that seems to fit multiple filing categories, put it in the very first one you thought of.

, Click on the folder that holds your bookmarks.

, Click on the bookmark you want to move and drag it to the new folder. Release the mouse button to place the bookmark in the folder.


Repeat this procedure until you have all your bookmarks placed. You may need to create new folders for categories you missed, and you may end up having created categories you're not using.

, You can sort your bookmarks automatically, or manually—or a combination of the two.

,


Right-click on the folder containing the bookmarks you wish to sort.
From the contextual menu, select Sort by Name.
The contents will be sorted by type, and then by name. Folders will be at the top, sorted alphabetically, followed by individual URLs, also sorted alphabetically.

,


Click on the folder you want to sort manually, to open it.
Click and drag each bookmark to the desired position.
If you wish to move a bookmark to a different folder, just drag it to that folder and release the mouse.

, There may be times when you want something other than a basic name sort. To do this, open the Library window.


On the menu bar, click Bookmarks and select Show All Bookmarks.
In the left pane, click on the folder you want to view. Its contents will appear in the main window on the right.
Click on the Views button at the top, and select the Sort menu, and choose a sort order.

Update Firefox.,
Back up your preferences file.,
Try one setting at a time.,
Adjust connections per server.,
Disable animations.,
Consider disabling prefetching.,
Toggle hardware acceleration and WebGL.",How to Make Firefox Load Pages Faster1," Many optimization tweaks from the past are now included by default in Firefox. To take advantage of them, update to the latest version. This happens automatically when you check your version number.;
, These settings can cause bugs and slowdown for some users. You can usually revert them without a problem, but back up the file just in case so you can restore your old preferences:


Open a new tab and enter about:support in the address bar.
Look for ""Profile Folder"" and click Show Folder next to it (Show in Finder on a Mac).
Go one level up from the folder that opens. You should see a folder with a string of letters and number, ending in "".default.""
Right-click this folder and choose ""Copy,"" then right-click in a backup location and select ""Paste.""

, These settings are intended for advanced users, and could cause problems with your add-ons. It's best to change one setting at a time so you can test the effect.


You can find tools online to test the speed of your browser precisely.

, Your browser limits the number of simultaneous connections to a single server. Upping this limit will make a noticeable change to pages with many images or videos, if your bandwidth can handle it. Increasing this too much is considered bad etiquette, and may get you banned from a server, but you have a little wiggle room:


Search for network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server and double-click the Value. Increase this to a maximum of 10.Some users prefer 8 to be on the safe side.
Search for network.http.max-connections. Set this value to 256, if it isn't already., Firefox displays small animations when opening or closing tabs. This is usually not an issue, but you can avoid some hang-ups if you tend to open or close many tabs at once:Set browser.tab.animate to False.
Set browser.panorama.animate_zoom to False.

, Prefetching loads pages before you visit them, guessing which links you'll click on. When working correctly, this should only use idle browser time, and will actually increase load speed. If you have unusually slow load speeds, a buggy prefetch could be the issue. Make the following changes to disable both forms of prefetch, then reverse them if there's no speed up:Change network.dns.disablePrefetch to True.
Change network.prefetch-next to False.
Change the value of network.http.speculative-parallel-limit to 0.

, These functions use your graphics card to speed up certain functions, especially loading videos. However, this can cause slow load times or blurry text, especially with older operating systems or graphics cards. Try watching videos with these settings on and off to see which works best for you:Change webgl.disabled to True or False.
Visit about:preferences#advanced in a new tab. Check or uncheck ""Use hardware acceleration.""
Unlike most setting changes, you may need to restart Firefox for these to take effect."

Reset Firefox.",How to Make Firefox Load Pages Faster2," On many web pages, advertisements take up a large fraction of the load time. Install Adblock Plus or another ad-blocking add-on to prevent these ads from loading.


Many web hosts rely on ads for most of their revenue. Consider disabling ad block on sites you'd like to support.

, Click the menu icon (three horizontal bars), then the help icon (?), then Restart with add-ons disabled. If Firefox runs much faster in Safe Mode, a faulty add-on is slowing you down.

, Enter about:addons in the address bar, or click the menu icon (three horizontal bars) and select Add-ons. Disable one add-on at a time, and browse for a while to see if it speeds you up. Visit the same page to remove the add-on permanently or re-enable it, depending on your test.

, If you have a custom theme, it could be slowing down your browser. Visit the Appearance tab on the add-ons page, and switch to the default theme.

, If you've just closed a bunch of tabs, Firefox might lag for a while until it deletes the contents of those tabs from its memory. Get rid of them right away by visiting about:memory and clicking Minimize memory usage., The cache is another feature that speeds up browsing in general, but can slow you down if it gets too full for your hard drive. To adjust the cache size, visit about:preferences#advanced, click the Network tab, and check ""Override cache management."" Increase the cache if you have a fast drive with plenty of space, and reduce it to about 250MB if you have a slow or mostly full hard drive.



Clearing your cache every couple months is a good idea, or whenever your browser gets unusually slow. You should also clear the cache before reducing its size.

, If you are experiencing major slowdowns on a broadband connection, you might have to reset Firefox to remove a buggy add-on or setting change. This will delete all your add-ons, themes, and download history, and return your settings to default. Visit about:support and click Refresh Firefox, or see this article for more detailed instructions.

Understand pipelining.,
Visit about:config.,
Enable pipelining.,
Adjust other settings (optional).,
Switch to secure-only pipelining if you encounter problems.",How to Make Firefox Load Pages Faster3," Pipelining allows Firefox to open more than one connection to a server. This will only help if you have a good broadband connection. Even then, this only gives a small speed boost, and can even cause slight slowdowns or errors. The difference in results are probably dependent on the way the web page is structured, so give it a try and see if it helps for your most visited websites., Open a new Firefox tab and enter about:config in the address bar.

, Search for network.http.pipelining using the bar at the top of the page. This entry should be set to ""Status: default"" and ""Value: false."" Double-click that line to change it to ""Status: user set"" and ""Value: true.""

, There are quite a few related settings you can change as well. Adjusting most of these is not recommended unless you know what you are doing. Here are a couple you could try:


network.http.pipelining.maxrequests was capped at 8 for many years, but now the limit (and the default) is 32. Raising this number could cause errors. Lowering it will reduce speed but free up your bandwidth a little.
Enabling network.http.pipelining.aggressive doubles down on the tactic: when it works, you'll be even faster, and when it doesn't, you'll be much slower.If you route all your internet use through a proxy, you'll need to enable network.http.proxy.pipelining. (You'll need to do a new search to find this.)

, If pipelining is slowing you down, or causing errors in your web pages, return it to the default ""false"" position. You can still implement pipelining for secure websites by enabling network.http.pipelining.ssl. Most pipeline-related errors come from proxy servers, which are not an issue with secure connections.Despite the problems with ""unsecure"" connections, pipelining does not open you up to any security risks.

Firefox – Click The Firefox button in the upper-left corner. Hover over Help and select About Firefox. This will open a window displaying your Firefox version information. If your browser is not up to date, updates will be automatically downloaded and installed. See this guide for more details on updating Firefox.

Chrome – Click the menu button in the upper-right corner of the Chrome window. Select About Chrome towards the bottom of the menu. A new tab will open and Chrome will check to see if updates are available. If they are, they will be installed automatically. This guide has more details on updating Chrome.

Internet Explorer – The method of updating depends on the version of Internet Explorer you are using. For older versions, you will need to update through Windows Update. For Internet Explorer 10 and 11, you can enable automatic updates by clicking the Gear icon and then selecting About Internet Explorer. See this guide for more details on updating your specific version.;
, Sometimes, the pop-up software is embedded too deep to remove by updating. In cases like these, reinstalling or changing your web browser may help solve the problem.


First, download the latest version of the browser you want to use. You can find the download links on the homepage of each browser.
Uninstall your current browser. You can do this from the Control Panel, which can be accessed from the Start Menu. Open the “Programs and Features” or “Add/Remove Programs” application and look for your browser on the list. Once you’ve found it, click Uninstall/Remove and follow the prompts. Note: Internet Explorer cannot be uninstalled in Windows.
Be sure to keep your bookmarks and user settings so that they can be imported again when the new browser is installed. You will be prompted about this during the uninstallation process.
Install the new browser. After the old browser has been uninstalled, run the installation file that you downloaded earlier. Follow the prompts to install the browser, and import your old bookmarks. When asked if you want to make the browser your default, select Yes.

, By default, pop-up blocking is enabled in Firefox. If it has been disabled, you can access the pop-up blocker settings in the Options menu.Click the Firefox button and select Options.
Click the Content tab.
Check the “Block pop-up windows” box.
Click the Exceptions button. Make sure that only trusted sites are on the list.

, Pop-ups are blocked by default in Chrome, but this may have been disabled. You can access the pop-up settings from the Settings menu.


Click the menu button in the upper-right corner and click Settings.
Click the “Show advanced settings” link at the bottom of the page.
Click the “Content settings” button in the Privacy section.
Scroll down to the Pop-ups section. Make sure that the “Do not allow any site to show pop-ups” option is selected.
Click the “Manage exceptions” button. Make sure that only trusted sites are listed.

, Pop-up blocking is enabled by default in later versions of Internet Explorer, but you can check to make sure it hasn’t been disabled.Click the Tool menu or the Gear icon. Select “Internet options”.
Click the Privacy tab.
Make sure that the “Turn on Pop-up Blocker” box is checked.
Click the “Settings” button. Make sure that only trusted sites are on the list.
Adjust the “Blocking level”. Use the dropdown menu at the bottom to choose your blocking level. Set it at “High” to disallow allow pop-ups.

, There are several browser add-ons that you can install on Firefox and Chrome that will help minimize the number of pop-ups you encounter. There are a lot of different add-ons available, so be sure to read reviews and only download trusted add-ons.


For Firefox, install AdBlock and NoScript to prevent sites from loading pages and content that you don’t want.
For Chrome, NoScript is not available, but AdBlock is.

, Viruses can install pop-ups that take over your browser and circumvent blockers. In order to get rid of these pop-ups, you’ll need to run a virus scan to get rid of intrusive programs.


Besides running an antivirus scan, you should also run an anti-malware/spyware scan, such as Malwarebytes or Spybot Search & Destroy. The programs are available for free and should only be downloaded from their respective developers’ websites.
Scanning in Safe Mode is much more effective than in a standard Windows environment.

, Toolbars can get installed without you realizing it during the installation of other programs. These toolbars can slow down your browser and actually lead to more pop-ups. The process for removing them will vary from toolbar to toolbar, but the general idea is the same. Follow this guide to remove toolbars from any web browser.

, This will remove any lingering entries in your registry, which may cause pop-ups to return. Registry cleaners won’t remove viruses or malware, so they should be run after removing those with other programs. CCleaner is one of the most popular free registry cleaners.

, You’ll encounter pop-ups more on sites with less than legitimate content. Sites that contain illegal files or scams will often bombard you with pop-ups. Try to stay away from sites that sound too good to be true. Follow this guide for more information on browsing safely.

Click the Menu (☰) button in the upper-right corner and select ""?"" at the bottom of the menu.
Click the ""Troubleshooting Information"" option.
Look at the ""User Agent"" line. If it says ""WOW64,"" you're using the 32-bit version and can use Java. If you see ""Win64"" or ""x64,"" you're using the 64-bit version and can't use Java.;
, If you found in the previous step that you're using the 64-bit version of Firefox, you'll need to install the 32-bit version to use Java.


You can download the 32-bit version by visiting mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/, scrolling down to ""English,"" and then clicking the first Windows download link.

, You'll need to install the Java plugin separately before you can access Java content.


Visit http://java.com/download/ in Firefox and click the ""Free Java Download"" button.
Click the ""Agree and Start Free Download"" button. This will begin downloading the installer.

, Click the Downloads button in the Firefox toolbar, then click the Java setup file. Follow the prompts to install the Java software.


During installation, uncheck the boxes to decline the installation of additional software. This will prevent your browser homepage from getting changed during installation.

, You'll need to restart Firefox in order for the Java plugin to start working. Make sure you close all open Firefox windows.

, Visit http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre to test Java in Firefox.


Click ""Activate Java"" in the gray box.
Click ""Allow and Remember"" in the box that appears. This will allow java.com to always run Java. Java will need to be allowed on each site you use it on, as enabling it universally is a major security threat.
Click ""Run"" in the window that appears. You can check the box to prevent this window from appearing in the future on this site.

, When you load a page with Java content, you'll get prompted to run it just like you did on the Java test page.


Click the ""Allow and Remember"" button in the dialog box that appears in the upper-left corner of the window. This will allow the site you're on to run Java content in your browser. You should only allow Java content from sites that you trust.
If the Java window appears, you'll need to click the ""Run"" button start the content.

, If you are trying to load Java content but aren't getting prompted to allow it, your Java plugin may be disabled.


Type about:addons in the address bar, then click the ""Plugins"" menu.
Find the ""Java(TM) Platform SE"" entry.
Use the drop-down menu to select ""Ask to Activate."" It is not recommended to select ""Always Activate,"" as this can leave your computer vulnerable to attack.

, If you still can't get Java content to play, there are a few things you can try:Uninstall all Java software on your computer and then reinstall it. Oftentimes conflicting versions of Java will cause problems. Removing all traces of Java from your computer and then reinstalling the latest version it can help fix a lot of issues. See Uninstall a Program for details.
Ensure that the 32-bit version of Java is installed. If you downloaded Java using the Download button, you likely don't need to worry about this since the 32-bit version is the one downloaded automatically. If you downloaded the installer from the list of all Java downloads, you may have downloaded the 64-bit version.
Reset your plugin registry file. Your plugin registry file may have become corrupted, preventing Java from loading. Open the Firefox menu, click ""?"", and then click ""Troubleshooting Information."" Click ""Show Folder"" in the ""Application Basics"" section. Close all Firefox windows and then delete the pluginreg.dat file. Restart Firefox and see if Java is enabled.

, Press ↵ Enter/⏎ Return to load it. JavaScript is enabled by default, and shouldn't need to be enabled manually., Changing the settings in this section can break Firefox, so you're warned before you can proceed.

, This will will find the JavaScript entry in the list of settings.

, If JavaScript was disabled, double-clicking it will enable it.

, This will ensure that your settings are applied. You should now be able to load JavaScript content.

Go to SumoPaint and once you are there, hit the big, light - blue button.,
Click on the tab named ""Image"", and then on ""Image"" size.,
Try one of two methods.,
Now over to the Persona Footer.,
Imagine this skin under the Firefox buttons, the search bar, the address bar and other jewelry your browser window consists of.,
If you are in doubt whether the job has been done well or not, then you can run a test on your own Firefox.,
And with that, go to this page right there and submit your persona.",How to Create Your Own Firefox Persona," The web browser should now direct you to the software Sumo Paint that is free to use.;
, The persona header must be a JPEG or PNG picture with 3000 (Width) x 200 (Height) pixels.

,
Option 1: Work on your painting with Sumo Paint. The program offers a lot more features than MS Paint, which means that you have the opportunity to make a nice - looking artwork. On the other hand, it will take time and requires a lot of backtracking with Ctrl + Z. When you think you are finished, click on the tab ""File"" and then choose the option ""Save to my computer"". Give your painting a name, and choose either PNG or JPG. What happens next is that you download your picture. Make sure you know where on the hard drive you store it.






Option 2: Simply download the ""paper"" to your hard drive as explained above and open it with MS Paint. It is likely that you will not get a smorgasbord of options and fancy possibilities with this option, but considering the fact that you may not want to spend too much time with this little project may convince you to do this job hastily and easily.







, Design it in the same way as you made the header, just be aware over that the picture must be 3000 pixels wide and 100 pixels high.

, How will it turn out and why? Is it stylish? Does it have a certain class?

,


Option 1: Go to the ""plugins"" - menu or simply go to the site and search for the add - on ""Personas Plus"". Install it, and restart the browser. Click on the fox down in the left corner, and then choose ""Preferences"" from the menu that pops up. Tick the box ""Show Custom Persona in menu"", and close the box. Click on the little fox again, choose ""Custom Personas"" and then ""Edit"". A tab telling to upload the images pops up. Notice that you have the opportunity to change the ""Text colour"" and the ""Accent colour"". Feel free to experiment with these buttons. Take notice of how the theme looks, and make some changes based on that.
Option 2 (Use this option only if you have Adobe Photoshop installed: Download a persona positioning template from this website. Open it in Photoshop, and then open the overlay layer set. Lay the header - file underneath one of the three OS layers (OSX, Windows XP or Windows Vista). Please make sure that the chosen OS layer is turned off.

, You will need to register and sign in before submitting your Firefox theme.

Get two URLs ...,
We'll continue to use Notepad as our scratch paper to construct more texts.,
Now, we'll create the Bookmarklet


From Firefox's Bookmark menu, choose ""Bookmark this Page"" to begin to create a new bookmark.,
Try out your new search!",How to Create Custom Searches Right from the Firefox Location Bar,"


The URL to use for the search (any terms you type will be inserted into a special spot in this URL)
The URL for the web site in general (we'll go to this in case we don't provide any search terms... a nice touch that adds flexibility)


The hardest one to get is the search URL. We'll start by going to Google Maps and doing a search similar to the pattern we want to create.
Open Google Maps (http://maps.google.com) and search on ""restaurants near Camden,sc"" for instance.

Above the right edge of the map is the link ""Link"". Click it.

A link for this particular map should appear. Right now it is in a box under the text ""Paste link in email or IM"". If it is not highlighted, select all the text in the box, then copy it to your clipboard. The URL I just got by doing that query is
http://maps.google.com/?q=restaurants+near+camden,sc&ie=UTF8&hq=restaurants&hnear=Camden,+Kershaw,+South+Carolina&z=13



We're going to edit this string to be more adaptable. Open Windows Notepad (how?) so that we can paste it there and work with it. Don't use MS Word, or WordPerfect, or any fancy word processing programs to edit the text. They might change the text so that it doesn't work any more. Use Windows Notepad, or a plain text editor like Notepad++ or Crimson Editor.

Trim off what we don't need. We can delete everything after the first ""camden,sc"". This will trim the URL down to this:
http://maps.google.com/?q=restaurants+near+camden,sc
As a side note, you can learn more about URL query parameters, which can help you better understand URLs, like the complex one Google Maps gave us.
Replace the location with your own location. Delete ""camden,sc"" and replace it with your city and state.

If your city contains a space (e.g. New York), don't put in the space, but put in a plus sign (+) instead (e.g. New+York). URLs need these instead of spaces to work properly.
Make sure there is not a space before and after the comma between your city and state.
You can also use your zip code instead of city,state. This article will continue to use Camden, SC as the example.
For the technically-minded, you can even get as precise as using latitude/longitude coordinates (use decimal format), if you know them. ""34.224294,-80.651321"" will make the start/home location a point outside of Camden, SC.


Replace the word ""restaurants"" with ""%s"". The URL now looks like this:
http://maps.google.com/?q=%s+near+camden,sc
Whatever we type in as search text will overwrite the string ""%s"", making this URL very dynamic. Anything we type will be searched based on being near to our location. This is our search URL.




Getting the general site URL is easier. We'll make it just center on the city. In our case, it is:
http://maps.google.com/?q=camden,sc
Remember that this is the URL we'll go to if we don't type in any search terms.;
,



Paste in the generic JavaScript template text. A few lines down from the stuff you've already typed into Notepad, copy and paste this text:
javascript:if('%s'!='%'+'s')%20location.href='SEARCH_URL';else%20location.href='GENERAL_URL';
We want to keep this as one long text, so make sure (once you get it into Notepad) to remove any hard return that copying and pasting from the browser might insert (since the browser will probably wrap it into two lines). However, you can wait till the very end to remove the returns, if you wish. Just don't forget.

Paste in your search URL. For this example, it is
http://maps.google.com/?q=%s+near+camden,sc
Paste it over (replacing) the text ""SEARCH_URL"". Be careful not to delete either of the apostrophes (single tick marks) before or after the text ""SEARCH_URL"". JavaScript is very picky about this kind of thing.

Paste in your general site URL. For this example, it is
http://maps.google.com
Paste it over (replacing) the text ""GENERAL_URL"". You are now done modifying this particular part of this mini-project. Be careful not to delete either of the apostrophes (single tick marks) before or after the text ""GENERAL_URL""

Verify that your JavaScript text is correct. Continuing to use our example location, the JavaScript text is:
javascript:if('%s'!='%'+'s')%20location.href='http://maps.google.com/?q=%s+near+camden,sc';else%20location.href='http://maps.google.com';
Pay close attention to getting everything right. JavaScript is picky! Again, we want to keep this as one long text, so make sure (once you get it into Notepad) to remove any hard return that copying and pasting from the browser might insert (since the browser will probably wrap it).

, It doesn't really matter what page you're on, because we're going to overwrite everything anyway.
In the ""Name"" text box, type something as a title for the search. For our example, I would type something like
Google Maps Search - Local

In the ""Folder"" box, select the folder in which you would like to keep this keyword search. A good idea is to create a folder in the main bookmarks area called ""Keyword Searches"", and to store them there (how?). Wherever you put it, remember the location. You'll be coming back to it in just a moment.
Open the properties dialog box for the bookmark you just created. You can do this by...

Finding that bookmark in the Bookmarks menu, then right-clicking it, or
By using the ""Organize Bookmarks"" utility, provided with Firefox.


In the Location text box, erase anything that is in there, then paste in the last big text we assembled. It's the one that starts with ""javascript:if(...""
In the Keyword text box, type in the short code that you'll use to access this search. A good idea is to call it ""mapl"" (stands for ""map local"").
Note: You could make the keyword long if you want to, but this is supposed to be something that saves you time, right?
Click the Save button to save the bookmark.

,


Click in Firefox's location bar (or use the Ctrl-L keyboard shortcut)
Type ""mapl"", then a space, then your search text, then the Enter key. Note that you can just type the keyword by itself to go to the site's general page. Note also that you don't have to type a plus sign instead of a space now. Firefox automatically converts spaces when using a keyword search. Examples:


mapl post office


mapl ace hardware
(will take you to these stores near Camden,SC)


mapl 123 Pine st
(will take you to this address near Camden,SC)


mapl
(will take you to the general URL we put in.)

Fool them.,
Change the file extensions.,
Use a software that will hide the material.",How to Hide Porn on Your Computer," Your first line of defense is to fool snoopers into ignoring your actual folder containing pornographic material. Therefore, don’t be brainless by naming your folder ‘Porn’ instead name it ‘business projects’, also make sure that you rename the raunchy material within the folder to some generic name that doesn’t contain the words: Video, clips, images, porn or sex (use names for individual files such as file statistics, financial analysis etc.). You need this because snoopers can run a search on your computer and they are most likely to use those preceding words.;
, After renaming your folders, you can change the default file extension types to add more confusion about where your X-rated files are located. If you don’t know how to change the files types, simply right-click on the individual video’s thumbnail > select ""Rename"" > change the text after the dot (e.g., .wmv or .avi) to something else. If you have named your porn file ‘Business Presentation’ then it makes sense to change the extension to a PowerPoint extension (.pptx), though you can also choose a .doc or .docx extension alternatively., If you want to be 100% sure that no one is able to discover your hidden secrets and find your naughty files, then its best to download third party software designed to hide pornographic material.


Be careful when downloading unknown software from the internet. It's a good way to get a virus or some other form of nasty malware if you aren't cautious.

Consider VPN.,
Try ""Socks"".",How to Skip Internet Filtering in Iran," It means when you do that you no longer are in your country! You physically are but virtually you are for example American or German or wherever internet has no filtering (depends on your anti filter software or your new IP). One of the ways of changing IP is with software such as ""Ultra Surf"". This program has many versions but the one you can easily get is Ultra Surf 9.8. To get this program you should go to Google and write ""download u98"" (you should write download in Farsi) and search for a site which is not blocked itself and download this program. After downloading, open the program and wait for it to connect then you can surf the internet free but not that fast!


Another software which is really safe for political movements is ""Tor"". Search it in Google and find a site which is not blocked itself and download it . then you extract the download file and run the program then you wait for it to connect. Tor uses three IPs in one time so you pass through three different countries which is what makes it really safe and free but not that fast!
Another software that you can easily download and use is ""Free Gate"". right now it's the easiest way to use internet freely. you can just look for a website in Google (right now most of Iranian websites that have this program are NOT blocked) and download it, then open it and wait for it to connect , in the end it shows you your new IP address then you can surf the net freely . it also doesn't have any effect on your Internet speed.;
, VPN is an anti filter which you should buy. But where? There are too many ads for selling VPN in Iranian sites which you shouldn't buy because most of them are for government and they can easily control you. Beware that many people got arrested in this way. The safest way to buy VPN is internet cafes. They make VPN themselves and you can buy it. They give a connection program, username and password. Then you use user name and password to connect with your program to another country like USA. Then you can surf the internet safe and fast.

, Socks is like VPN, available on the internet but you shouldn't buy online for the same reasons as VPN. You get them from internet cafes. It's like VPN but using it is not that easy. When you buy it the seller tells you how to use it. It's the best way of skipping filtering and it's really fast and really safe.

Use thought substitution to overwrite the horrible image.,
Replace the memory with something positive, but equivalent.,
Look at pictures of something that makes you happy.,
Watch positive videos.",How to Forget Something Horrible You Saw on the Internet1," The idea behind thought substitution (sometimes called thought displacement) is that you have the ability to control what you think and how you react. You can intentionally forget bad memories by filling your mind with more positive things.Your brain has a limited focus, and you can only keep so many thoughts in your immediate sphere of awareness. Try to replace the negative memory by exposing your brain to something brighter. Watch a happy or inspirational video, lose yourself in a story, or just look at pictures of cute animals.;
, Thought substitution works best when there is some relation between the replaced thought and the ""overwriting"" thought. Thus: if you watched a horrifying video, find an inspirational video that grips your emotions just as powerfully. If you saw a nasty picture, look at images that make you smile. If you read something that triggered you, try reading a story that calms your mind., Browse lists of memes or photos of cute animals. Scroll through photos of something dear to you: good memories with friends and family, pictures of pets, pictures of places. Run a web image search for, say, ""cute baby pandas"" or ""lazy sloths"" to find the photos you need.

, Browse comedy videos on YouTube, or watch an episode of your favorite show. Look for videos of simple things: a baby laughing, an ecstatic puppy, or someone smiling. Find videos of peaceful things: the lull of the waves, the hum of a summer forest, or a panoramic mountaintop view.


Run a web search for the sort of videos that you want to find. Search for ""happy videos"" or ""puppy playing"" to find content to soothe your mind.
Check out YouTube Haiku or Vine for short but absorptive videos.

",How to Get a Free Internet Filter,"


Some programs control Internet surfing. They block certain websites, restricting access for 1 or more users. In some cases, you can type in messages that will pop up when an off-limits site is accessed.
Software programs go a step further. They usually have the ability to set up timers and other usage limits that include file sharing and use of certain programs.;
, Some programs are easy to set up, while others use Linux and can be customized with programming knowledge.

, This popular tech site posts reviews of popular free downloads. If you choose 1 of the options, you can download it directly off the site.


Go to download.cnet.com/windows/parental-control. You may want to read reviews on top choices, like Spyrix Free Keylogger, JuniorWatch or K9 Web Protection.
Use the filter at the top of the list to adjust which programs you want to look through, such as those with the most downloads, the best user reviews or editor's rating.

, The programs, like FamilyShield, provided by OpenDNS, are some of the most popular Internet filters on the Internet.


OpenDNS works by replacing the Domain Name Server from your Internet Service Provider and replacing it with their own. Your account controls the sites that OpenDNS blocks as you are accessing the Internet.
OpenDNS may be easily subverted by employees or children with computer proficiency. They may be able to find the router and enter the DNS to get around it.

, This is what many schools use, and you can download it for free from www1.k9webprotection.com or download.cnet.com. It is an Internet filter only, and it will not control usage time or programs.

,


You will need to use a proxy server in order to use these 2 programs. You can use the proxy server Squid for either program.

, You can use your current Norton account to sign up for their free filtering program.


Reports suggest that this is a very user friendly program. You can also arrange to receive alerts when websites are blocked and reports about overall usage.

, Download.cnet.com is also a reputable source.

,, In most cases, you will need to have a password that your children cannot use. You may need to return to this site after set up to start setting up filters, if your program is not software-based.

, For programs like OpenDNS, devices that you filter must all use the same router.

Try to push down the memory whenever it emerges.,
Understand how memory suppression works.,
Practice letting go.",How to Forget Something Horrible You Saw on the Internet2," Suppressing memories, like thought substitution, has been proven to help people forget negative memories.Your negative memories are usually linked to ""triggers"" that remind you of what you saw and how you felt. If you can force yourself to ignore the memory when it comes back into your head, you might be able to break these ""episodic"" links and let go.

, Cognitive scientists divide memories into two patterns: episodic and semantic. Episodic memory is experiential and subjective, while semantic memory is factual and objective. When you see something horrible online, it triggers an immediate and viscerally negative reaction, and it is linked in your episodic memory to things that remind you of what you saw. By forming new associations with these triggers, you may be able to gradually ""forget"" what you saw.Episodic memory is our mode of remembering specific things that we've experienced. These memories are usually tied to the emotional context of what happened. Thus, the memory of this horrible thing that you saw might be linked to triggers that continually bring back the image.
Semantic memory is a more structured record of facts, meanings, ideas, and observations about our external world. Our brains tend to store this knowledge independently from our personal experience. Semantic memory does not usually include the emotional context.

, If you came across an especially horrific thing online, there's a good chance that the image pops up in your head from time to time. Try to catch your thoughts and turn them around. You can do this in two ways: you can ""let go"" of the thought by confronting it and coming to terms with it, or you can ""suppress"" the thought by pushing it deeper into your mind. When your mind turns to a dark place, try to consciously turn your awareness toward brighter things. You can look up or you can look down.

"
"
Go outside.,
Be more careful when browsing the web.,
Report illegal content.",How to Forget Something Horrible You Saw on the Internet3," Leave the Internet behind for a while, and try to immerse yourself in the world around you. Catch up with some friends, or go for a run, or go spend time in nature. Fix your mind in the present moment, and do something you love. The horrible thing that you saw online may seem much more abstract once you've stepped away from the keyboard and involved yourself in more relevant things.

, The Internet projects the dark depths and the soaring heights of the human condition. It is a maze of code, and each click is a step around an unknown corner. You might encounter something beautiful that inspires you to change your life – or you might come across something utterly soul-crushing.


Think before you click. Try to be aware of the context of each click that you make, and ask yourself whether you trust the source that provided the link. Do your best to figure out what you're going to see when you click the link. Ask yourself whether that's something that you want in your head.

, If you came across something illegal and obviously harmful, consider reporting it to your local police station. It can be hard to track down Internet criminals, but it's been done before. Think about examples of situations that might beg further action:


Someone posted photos of a dog that had been horribly abused. The photos were posted to a local forum, and you think there's a good chance that the poster was physically abusing this dog in your area.
Someone posted child pornography or other evidence of child abuse. Not only is this activity illegal, but it is harmful to children. For all you know, a child's life could be at stake.

Check the ""Use this proxy server for all protocols"" box, and ensure that the right Port has been entered.

, Once your proxy information is saved, you can start using your new portable browser. Plug the USB drive into the computer at your school or work and open the Firefox Portable program. Firefox will connect to the internet through your proxy, bypassing the blocking software.


Browsing through a proxy will usually be slower than normal browsing. Not all content may be displayed correctly.
You don't need to worry about clearing the history or deleting your tracks, as everything is stored in your portable browser.
Free proxy servers on proxy lists change often, and you may find that your proxy settings no longer work. You will need to change them from time to time.

Find a web proxy that works.,
Open the web proxy on your device.,
Enjoy unfiltered access to the Internet.",How to Bypass Your School's Filter on Any iOS Device (Hack Free)1," You may have to do a bit of digging before finding a proxy that hasn’t already been blocked by your school. A web search for “web proxies” will lead to all sorts of options. If your school blocks sites that list proxies, use a network outside of your school to make a list of several web proxy sites to try. Proxy.org is a great site to find a current list of web proxies.


Using a web proxy will help you get around web filters but won’t affect your other apps. If you’re trying to use an app that your school has blocked, you’ll have better luck with a VPN.
Web proxies can be a bit slow, so be patient while things load.;
, In your browser, navigate to the web proxy and look for the box that asks for a URL or web address. It will be near the top of the screen. Enter the address of any site you’d like to visit.

, As long as you do your browsing through the web proxy website (not another tab or browser window), you’ll be able to access the sites blocked by your school.

Find a web-proxy.,
Choose a proxy site.,
Select the URL box.",How to Bypass Web Restrictions2," A web-proxy is useful if you aren't on your own computer because all the work is being done through the browser, so the method works regardless of your computer's operating system. All of your browsing traffic is directed through the proxy website's server, tricking the blocking software into thinking you're connecting to a legitimate website.


There are several websites that list proxies that you can use. Proxy.org is a great place to start and is constantly updating the list as proxies come and go.
There's a good chance that proxy listing sites will be blocked by a school or work network. Visit the site at home and make a list of 10-15 proxy sites to try at the blocked computer.
Proxies that are overused get noticed and blocked, so vary which ones you use regularly.
Using a proxy will make browsing significantly slower. This is because the traffic is rerouted through the proxy, reinterpreted and then sent to your location. Be aware that videos and websites may take longer to load.

, If the site is blocked, try a different one. When picking sites from a list of proxies, try using sites that are geographically closer to your location. This will help to ensure the fastest browsing experience possible.

, Enter the address of the website you wish to visit. Since proxy sites reinterpret the data of website you are trying to access, there's a chance that the site won't load correctly. Most commonly the video will not load. If this is the case, try again with a different proxy site.

"
"
Find the IP address of the website that's blocked.,
Enter the address into the browser.",How to Bypass Web Restrictions3," Some filter programs only block websites by their hostname, and not the IP address. By entering the IP address instead of the website name, you can bypass these blocks. This will not work for all web filtering programs.


Open the Command Prompt in Windows by pressing ⊞ Win+R and typing cmd. Open the Terminal in Mac in the Utilities subfolder of the Applications folder.
Type ping address. For example, if you wanted to find wikiHow's IP address, you would type ping www.wikihow.com.
Note the IP address that is returned when the ping is complete.

, Enter the address into your browser's address bar and load the site. If the filter software doesn't block IP addresses, the site will be displayed.

Set up a web server.,
Install PHProxy.,
Test it out.,
Set up your port forwarding.,
Find your home network IP address.,
Use the proxy.",How to Bypass Web Restrictions4," You can configure your home computer to act as a proxy for your internet browsing at school or work. Once your home proxy is configured, you simply use any web browser to point to the proxy's address, which will then act much like the proxy websites in the previous sections. You will be tricking the blocking software into thinking you are connecting to a legitimate website.


The first step to setting up your own proxy server is to install a web server on your home computer. This will transform your home computer into a server that you can access from anywhere in the world. One of the most popular free programs for doing this is WAMPServer, which contains everything you need in one installer. Once you install WAMPServer, you will see its icon in your System Tray.
Mac users can install MAMP, which performs essentially the same functions.
Turn on the server by right-clicking on the WAMPServer icon and selecting ""Put Online"". Test it by right-clicking on the icon again and selecting ""Localhost""; if you see the WAMPServer configuration page, then everything worked.

, This is a free, open-source program that installs a web-based proxy into your server. Make sure to download PHProxy from SourceForge to ensure that you are downloading a legitimate version. This software will turn your web server into a proxy much like a proxy from the lists in the previous sections.


PHProxy comes in a single ZIP file. Extract the folder inside the archive and place it into your WAMP (or MAMP) web server root directory. In Windows this is C:\wamp\www\, and in OS X this is Applications/MAMP/htdocs/. Copy the PHproxy folder into this location to install it.
You don't need to run any installation programs, PHProxy is ""installed"" simply by being copied into the right folder.

, Once PHPproxy is installed, you can quickly test it out by opening your browser and typing in the following address: http://localhost/phproxy/. If the PHProxy page appears, then everything went OK.


Test the proxy by visiting an address through the ""Web Address"" field. You should see the site load with your proxy information before the regular site address in the browser's address bar.

, Ports act like doors to your network, and are typically left closed for security reasons. In order to get your proxy to work, you will need to open some of these doors. This is accomplished by configuring your router to forward all incoming website requests through your new web server. To do so, you will need to know your computer's internal IP address, which is its ""location"" on your home network. Open your router's configuration page, navigate to the Port Forwarding section, and then create an entry for TCP/UDP traffic on Port 80 to your computer's internal IP address.

, With port forwarding set up, all you need to know to access your web server from anywhere in the world is your home network's external, or public, IP address. You can quickly discover this by going to Google on your home computer and typing ip address into the search. Your public IP will be listed at the top of the page.


Test your proxy by opening the browser on your computer, entering in your public IP address, and ending the address with /phproxy/. For example, if your public IP address is 24.24.24.24, the address for your proxy would be 24.24.24.24/phproxy/.

, Your proxy is now configured and you can use it wherever you'd like. Simply enter the address you found in the previous step into any browser to bypass any restrictions.Most home networks have IPs that change on a regular basis. If you find that you can no longer connect to your server, your IP has most likely been changed and you will need to find it again.
If you get caught at school or work connecting to a proxy, you can get into serious trouble.
A proxy does not encrypt any data coming into your network, so a network administrator could still see what you are looking at if they are monitoring you. All the proxy does is bypass any restrictions put in place on the network.

If you are using Internet Explorer 6 or 7, you will need to upgrade to at least 8 in order to install an adblocker.
Ad blockers are generally more powerful for browsers other than Internet Explorer. Consider installing Chrome or Firefox for more powerful ad protection.
Consider using a fully free web browser, such as one from the list at the Free Software Directory, instead of their proprietary counterparts. These alternatives look and work almost exactly the same with additional focus on privacy features:

IceCat instead of Firefox;
Chromium instead of Google Chrome;
Gnuzilla instead of SeaMonkey.

;
, There are adblock extensions for every major browser. These extensions will detect and remove ads from websites. Some extensions will be more effective than others, and removing ads may cause problems with the website you are viewing. Below are some of the more popular extensions for the major browsers. Note that AdBlock and Adblock Plus are different products.



Internet Explorer - Adblock Plus

Chromium (Google Chrome) - AdBlock, Adblock Plus, uBlock

IceCat (Firefox, Iceweasel), Gnuzilla (SeaMonkey) - Adblock Plus, Adblock Edge, uBlock

Safari - AdBlock, Adblock Plus, uBlock

, You can download these extensions from your browser's extension manager, but it will be quicker if you install it from the product's website. Visiting the website will automatically provide you the link for your specific browser.

, The process will vary a little bit depending on the browser, but generally you just need to click the Install or Download button on the ad blocker's website. You will usually be asked to confirm that you want to install the extension.


If you are using Internet Explorer, the setup process will occur much like a regular program.

, In order to complete the installation of your extension, you will need to restart your browser. If you are using Internet Explorer, click the Enable button at the bottom of the window.

, Many sites rely on advertising revenue to stay online. If you visit a site often, consider adding it to your ad blocker's whitelist. This will allow the website to potentially make revenue off of your visit.


To add a site to the adblocker's whitelist, open the adblocker's configuration page and add sites manually, or visit the site and then use the adblocker's extension button to add the site.

Watch only trusted programs and channels.,
See the programs in their website like SVT is svt.se.,
If you go into the room where TV or computer is showing a screamer by force, and if you have to go to an EVA AIR airplane, close your eyes.,
Let someone who isn't scared watch TV on that program and let him/her record for you if it isn't scary.





",How to Avoid TV Scary Popups," TV2 from Thailand and SVT2 from Sweden contains lots of pranks. Both scary and not scary. (I notice that channels that contains ""2"" will be the prank channel)



 ;
, If you see the strange program only on Halloween , and if once watched and it comes as the optical illusion with relaxing music, It is the screamer





, and sleep there. The airplane really not going somewhere, after the boarding music (by Evergreen Symphony Orchestra) it will show the ""Kikia"" screamer on TV, then after the video ends it loops again for hours, then the announcer says ""Made... In... Taiwan""

Stop the video or don't play the game first (even if your brothers, sisters, and friends tell you to do it).
Look for signs that means it's a trick (e.g:youtube comments, subject or others).
Ask friends/family members, they may warn you.;
,


If it's unusually loud at the end or the middle part, it may be a trick.

, Sit in a place where you can see some, but not all, of the screen. Let it play.

Note whether what level of security is required.,
Select the cryptographic function which is the best suitable for you.",How to Secure Passwords Before Storing in MySQL,"


In case of a standard, small website, you'll only have to think about ""script kiddies"" who might use only some online MD5/SHA1 decoder
In case of a website with good amount of visitors, you'll have to consider hackers who might run extra programs.
In case of a website dealing with high amount of money, you'll have to deal with experienced hackers.;
,


MD5 is a highly used yet unrecommended function due to the fact that it has security problems.
SHA1 is a good function for smaller websites with proper salting. It also has security problems, yet it is still usable.
SHA256 is a good function for medium sites due to the fact that it has no known weaknesses which might decrease its security by a low amount.
For high-traffic websites and websites dealing with money, you should follow some cryptography news and change your method when something concerning your method makes it more breakable. Currently SHA256 is good enough, however, you later might want to switch to SHA3 - which is not selected yet but there are 5 final, experimental candidates for it.

Make a password from a list of random words.,
Take the first letter of each word in a sentence.,
Come up with a simple rule to adjust passwords to each site.,
Write down passwords securely.,
Consider a password manager.,
Avoid obvious passwords.",How to Remember Passwords1," This password is just four or five words in a row, such as ""talkdeathplaidhonest."" An old idea popularized by an XKCD comic, this system creates passwords that are easy to remember and quite secure. The catch is, you must choose the words at random, for example by using a random word generator or flipping through a book. People who choose the words themselves are much more likely to pick certain types of words, which makes the password much easier for a hacker to guess., Create a unique sentence that you find easy to memorize, then use the first letter of each word as a password. Preserve the capitalization and punctuation. A familiar fact or a story from your life is easy to memorize, but avoid simple statements that someone who knows you could guess. A lie about your life is even better, if you can remember it.If you're required to include numbers, replace ""to"" with ""2"" and ""for"" with ""4,"" or come up with a sentence that includes a number.
For example, the sentence ""It was no fun breaking my tooth when I was 12."" becomes ""IwnfbmtwIw12.""
Do not use famous quotes or song lyrics, as some hackers test for this system using a quote database., No one wants to memorize dozens of unrelated passwords, but reusing the same one is even worse. One compromise is to start with one ""base password,"" then adjust it with a rule based on account-specific info such as login name or site name.This is not secure if someone is targeting you personally, but it's an easy way to memorize passwords that should survive mass cracking attempts (when hackers are targeting the service's database).


For example, let's say your base password is RoM4,5zi,. (You can start with something easier to memorize, but that can make your ""rule"" more obvious if one password is compromised.)
Let's say your rule is ""Add the second, fifth, and sixth letters of your login name to the front of your base.""
On website 1, your login name is ""MechaBob."" The 2nd, 5th, and 6th letters are eaB, so your password for this site is ""eaBRoM4,5zi.""
On website 2, your login name is ""RobertMarshall,"" Your password here is ""ortRoM4,5zi.""

, If you must write your passwords down, keep them in a secret, private location away from your computer. Instead of just writing down your full login info — a disaster if someone finds the notebook — try one of these systems to make them more secure:


Keep one notebook with a numbered list of your accounts, e.g. ""1. Work Email, 2. Auction Site."" Keep a second notebook in a different room with a numbered list of passwords.
Write the passwords down in code, such as an alphabet cipher, shifted one key left on the keyboard, or anything else you can come up with. This could delay a thief long enough for you to change your passwords, at least.
Instead of writing down passwords, write down hints for yourself.

, After installing a password manager, the software creates and remembers secure passwords for each of your accounts. All you need to do is choose one secure password for the manager — and since this protects everything, this had better be 16 characters long and completely un-guessable. This is much more secure than using the same weak password for every site, but you are creating one point of failure.


Services that store your master password in the cloud are more vulnerable to attack.The ""remember your password"" feature that came with your browser or computer is not a secure password manager.

, Unfortunately, the easiest passwords to memorize are also the easiest to guess. Do not rely on these common techniques:


Never use a famous date in your life, the name or initials of yourself or a relative, or other obvious personal details. Even a hacker who doesn't know you may test passwords that follow these common formats.
Avoid obvious patterns. ""Orange Yellow Green Red"" is much easier to guess than ""Orange Capture History Dress."" Numerical series like ""4567"" are the worst of all.
Obvious substitutions such as 1 for i or $ for S do not increase security, and make your password harder to remember. The only reason to do this is for accounts that require numbers or symbols in the password.

Think back to any old passwords you may have had, perhaps involving the names of relatives or pets, birthdays, or common sequences such as ""1234"" or ""qwerty.""
You may have added a number to the end of your usual password. ""1"" is a very common choice, as is a significant year (usually the user's birthday).Make sure CapsLock and NumLock are turned off.

Take your passwords as seriously as the information they're meant to protect.",How to Remember a Forgotten Password," Operating under the assumption that people forget their passwords one at a time, it is usually a good idea to try out other personal passwords you tend to use regularly. While it's now common practice for web users to use separate passwords for different things, some passwords are often used for numerous things.


If you're unsure, it's altogether possible that you didn't actually forget a password, but only forgot that a certain password corresponded with an account.
Don't forget to try out old or out-of-date passwords as well, if the account you're trying to access is fairly old.;
, Any hunt for passwords cannot go without touching upon the most obvious, common answers. This is especially true if you have no idea what the password is and you're trying to guess from scratch. Try to think of the most intuitive, obvious passwords you may have chosen. Passwords like 'Password', 'Cheeseburger', or your full name are incredibly easy to hackers to exploit, and if you think you may have defaulted with one of those, you'll at least have given yourself an easy code to break.


Some of the most common passwords include '123456', 'abc123', 'qwerty', and 'iloveyou'. Birthdays are also common.If you think you may have been sneaky enough to add a twist on an otherwise weak password, try out testing some basic encryptions. For instance, if you may have used your name or your birth year in the password, try spelling them backwards.
Most passwords today require at least one number. The most common numerical addition is to add a '1' at the end of the password; the second most common addition is to add one's birthday (e.g. 1992).

, In a lot of cases, people will find inspiration for their passwords from their life and surroundings. If you have a rough idea when the account and password were created, try to look back on that time and decide what important factors may have influenced your choice of password. Did you have a significant other at the time, or a pet? Setting some time aside to reflect upon your past is helpful if you're trying to remember something specific like a password. Other examples include your hometown, your favourite sports team, or the name of your best friend.
Stressing yourself out while trying to remember will have the opposite effect you want it to. The human brain has a much harder time retrieving information while under duress, so make sure to relax, breathe, and remind yourself that nothing is the end of the world.

, Whenever you're typing in your password, make sure you're writing accurately. Something as simple as leaving the Caps Lock key on will reject an otherwise correct password, and runs the risk of giving you the impression that the right answer is actually wrong! Since passwords are usually shown as asterisks on the screen, it's important you type a password carefully if you're unsure about it. This is especially important when you're making a password for the first time. If you accidentally confirm a typo in your password, you'll stand very little chance of retrieving it in the future.

, While it may sound like the hardest thing to do when you're stressed out over losing access to a computer or account, relaxing via meditation can be a powerful tool for memory retrieval. Sometimes, the most effective way to remember something is to try not thinking about it at all. Take a deep breath, and gradually release the frustration from your body; being anxious or angry isn't getting you any closer towards finding your password, so you should instead focus on becoming as serene as possible.


While true relaxation cannot occur if you're simply going about it as a way to remember, it's possible you'll remember it once you're in a clearer state of mind.
Going for a run or working out helps a great deal as well. The mind tends to function much better when the body is in motion!

, There are certain programs available that are specifically designed to retrieve lost passwords. While generally associated with hacker culture, legitimate enterprises recommend these programs as a way to regain access to a computer. Download the software from another computer, put it on a CD or USB drive, and plug it into the computer. The password cracker will immediately infiltrate your system and fish out the account data. The process is automatic and incredibly fast, so if it's your OS password you're worrying about, this solution can be a quick, and relatively inexpensive fix. Password crackers are only designed for cracking OS passwords, like a Windows user account. Online accounts like emails cannot be retrieved this way.
Although it's perfectly legitimate to try cracking your own password with this kind of software, using it to hack the accounts of others can get you into serious trouble and isn't recommended.

, If you've tried and can't remember the password firsthand, it's likely you'll never get it back. Fortunately, that doesn't mean you've lost the associated account. Most sites will have a 'Forgot Password' option available for this very sake. Click this button and follow the steps to rest your password.


If it's a non-email password (like Facebook), resetting a password will be fairly easy. An automated confirmation will be sent to your email, from which you'll reset your password and start a new one.
Some email services (like Hotmail) offer the possibility of connecting them with another email account for the sake of password resetting. If you have another email account and have done this, resetting the password will be just as easy as it would be with any other non-email account.

, If it's an email account you're trying to access, and you haven't connected it with a separate email address, your other option of resetting the password is by answering your listed secret questions. Many email accounts will get you to answer personal questions (e.g. the name of your first pet) as a contingency if you end up forgetting your password later on. Click on the 'Forgot My Password' button and answer questions wherever prompted. While this won't bring you back your password, it stands a good chance of helping you reclaim your password.
Unfortunately, many people don't take secret questions seriously, and some may forget their answers sooner than the passwords themselves!

, While contacting the company that hosts your account won't help you get your password back, the company may be able to help you regain access by resetting the password. While you'll have to deliver certain proof of your identity, some services will allow you to reclaim use of your account through calling or messaging them.


Keep in mind that the process of verification can take a while even in the best circumstances, so patience is a must should you decide to take this route.

, There are many reasons you may have forgotten a password in the first place. For one, it may have been thought up on the spot, or you might have made it too complex to remember in full. While making your password hard to guess is an essential security step, the most important thing about a password is how uniquely memorable it is to you. Thinking up a distinctive, but memorable password can be difficult, as obvious answers (like the name of a place or person) are too easily guessed.Try combining a few individually memorable words. For instance, your pet's name is a weak choice on its own, but pairing it with something completely unrelated, like your favourite food or comic book character, is a strong way to send hackers for a loop.
When you're making a password, most sites will have an indicator that tells you how strong your password is. While these are vague tools at best, you'll want to aim for an average strength at least. Adding symbols and numbers to your code is a smart way to improve security.
Another common trick you can use is to invent a mnemonic acronym. Write the first letter of each word of a memorable sentence, thereby creating a gibberish word. For example, the sentence ""Friday is my favourite day of the week"" would become 'Fimfdotw'. Likewise, ""Free jazz is my favourite kind of music"" would become 'Fjimfkom'. This can be applied to virtually any sentence imaginable, so long as it has enough words to satisfy the password's minimum character count-- usually 8.

, While you should write passwords you'll be able to remember reasonably well, you should write down your passwords and put them somewhere safe if you think there's a chance you'll forget them again. Seal the envelope, and leave it unmarked, or mark it as something misleading. That way, if someone manages to find it, they won't likely grasp its importance.


If you're really concerned that you'll lose the envelope, you might consider giving the envelope to a trusted friend or a loved one. This is not recommended however, as it means giving up the sole control over your passwords and, by extension, your personal information.

, Especially i you're using different passwords for each of your various accounts, you might find them difficult to keep up with on your own. Fortunately, there is password management software available that will fill in the data for you. On the downside, most password managers available cost money-- generally between 20 and 40 US dollars. However, you may find the added security worth it if you're worried about forgetting or the risk of being hacked.Because a password manager essentially does the legwork of password for you, you can afford to have more complex passwords without worrying about remembering them yourself.
As a free alternative, you could create an encrypted file on your computer with all of your passwords on it. That way, you'll only have to remember one of them off the top of your head.

, It goes without saying that passwords for banking information should be treated with greater weight than the password for your avant-garde jazz blog, but as a general rule, you want to make your passwords more difficult to crack depending on how important the account is to your life and well-being.


At the same time, while byzantine symbols or numbers can make a password harder to guess, it can also make them harder to remember. The trick is to strike a balance between complexity and memory. Don't write a password you don't think you'll be able to remember on a whim, and if you do, make sure to keep it written down on paper somewhere it does not stand any chance of getting misplaced or seen by someone else."

Go through these social media guidelines with your children.",How to Prevent Social Media Identity Theft1," Make sure you update them regularly both at work and at home. Most experts suggest that this should be done at least weekly, especially with Windows operating systems (OS).;
, Many social media sites automatically check this box under your sign in, so be vigilant about making sure it is never saved. If it saves, it may automatically bring up your account the next time someone else goes to that social media site.

, Try to use your full name both in the username and in the profile columns, to prevent anyone else from taking that account and using it to impersonate you. Treat your name like it is your brand, and try to protect it from illegal usage whenever you can.


Some people have very common names. If you cannot have your exact name, then try placing a ""."" between your first and last name. You can also include your middle name, middle initial or your profession in the username, if that helps to distinguish you apart from others with the same name.

, Identity thieves can open accounts and commit a number of financial crimes with just this information. You can decide if you want to use a profile picture, but try to make it a likeness that you can also use as a brand, and look for anyone else that tries to use it.

, Set your profile to private, and make sure you have to approve any friend requests, comments, photo tags, links or posts that appear on your page.


Be very discerning about who you accept friend requests from. Some thieves create accounts in order to grab information off accounts. Make sure you know everyone you are friends with, and frequently delete friends who you have no further desire to have contact with.

, New and successful social media scams create emails that are tailor made to look like they are directly from a social media provider. Always assume it is not, and go to the site directly to see if you have a message.

, Many experts suggest using a sentence that includes a number and only makes sense to you. Change your passwords to social media accounts every 1 to 3 months.

, In many instances, social media thieves have become actual thieves, taking this data and using it to rob people when they are out of town. Never be specific about where you live or when you are out of the house.

, Unless you intend on reading through their entire terms and conditions policy, you do not know where your information is going. Many companies sell the information they take off people using their free application to businesses or private individuals.

, Even your friends can have their identities stolen on social media sites and post links that lead thieves to retrieve your personal information or hack your computer.

, Although many young people are more adept at navigating the Internet, they may not fully understand the implications of posting private information, photos or potentially offensive material on the Internet. They may have to face even more adept social media thieves in the future, so prepare them well for the task.

, Making a username out of what you love to do will not only make it easy to remember, it will make it uniquely personal.


One way to do this is to use your pastime, and add your birth year to it. For example, climber86 or fictionauthor91 will likely be both unique, and personal—and thus, easy to remember.

, You might want to keep it simpler, and just use your first initial and last name. However, this is easier for those who possess a somewhat unique last name. For example, if your name is Felix Carpren, you'll have a much easier time than John Smith.


Adding your skill set as part of your name is one way to push even a common name into the world of the unique: jsmithcpa, for example.

, Barely anyone is going to know what Kindi is (an elvish language) or what the word Daonna means (Irish). Some of the most unique usernames aren't English!

, Instead of just your name, your job, or your pastime, combine them with your personality. While jsmith might be rejected virtually every time, brilliantjsmith probably has a good shot at being unique.


Note: Do not use your email name as a user name. Half of what makes a login unique is the username—the other half is a password. While it still would take some effort to hack your accounts, the truth is that most people have very easy-to-guess passwords. Giving an identity thief half the equation is simply not a good idea.

, Be judicious here: ""O"" might be too short, where ""reallyboredhousewivesofschenectadycountyohio"" is not only too long, who wants to type that every time they log in?

, This will, at the very least, brand you as hip and cool when you talk to the tech support department of a website. They'll ask for your username, and you can smile when you type ""w91b50n,"" which of course is a reference to William Gibson, who coined the term ""cyberspace.""

, You may need to modify that a little bit, as there are probably a lot of ""cleos,"" ""patches,"" and ""buddies"" out there.


The same is true of sports teams, though those can make a good start to a unique username. Try adding your favorite player's number to make it different: tblazers12 or goblazers#12 are ways to keep it local.

, Maybe try rhymes, like dennisthemenace, or alliteration, like meticulousmathilda.

, You can use keyboard symbols like $#%*^, Unicode characters such as ♠, ♣, ♥, ♦, ♪, and ♫, or other special characters, but be aware that if you're trying to keep things simple, not every website will allow those sorts of characters. In some cases, like Minecraft...You cannot put any of the following keyboard symbols;$#%*^, You'll have to remember which site uses which user name.

First you have to know what are the ingredients that build a strong password, one that is very difficult to guess: a mix of small and capital letters; some numbers and one or two special characters.,
Let's practice: let's say you are a Red Sox fan, so you can strip the vowels and mix small and capitals: RdSx.,
Good!,
Obviously you would use gRdSx77&o for Google, and so on...

",How to Have Many Different Passwords for Many Different Websites," When you have the right mix, you are done with the first part.;
, Now you add a 2 digit number that means something to you and a special character. Let's say it became RdSx77&.

, Now let's deal with the problem of having one different password for each service. You can add, let's say, the first 2 letters of the service you are using, the first in the beginning of the password, and the second in the end. If you want to log in Yahoo, you would use the y in the beginning and the a in the end, so the final password would be yRdSx77&a, which is very hard to guess.

Avoid using easy-to-identify - and therefore easy-to-hack - passwords such as family names, birthdays, house numbers, phone numbers.,
Brainstorm a short list of passwords that you will remember.,
Use a unique password for each application.,
Change your passwords frequently.,
Make use of case sensitive characters.,
Determine whether you need a “password backup.” Though it’s safer to avoid recording your passwords, sometimes doing so is a necessity.,
Consider Using a Password Protected Spread Sheet to Hold Your Passwords.",How to Manage Your Passwords," In particular, never use a Social Security number as a password. Hackers have become expert at decrypting Social Security numbers based on knowledge of how they are assigned to individuals.;
, Have passwords handy before you are prompted to create one helps to take the pressure off and prevent you from creating easily decrypted passwords.

, Passwords for everything from your bank account and ATM card to your utility and Facebook accounts should all be unique. Using the same password for multiple purposes may be easier to remember, but it’s also like putting out a welcome mat for the identity thieves.

, Changing passwords helps reduce the chance that someone will get their hands on an old password and be able to use it to access sensitive accounts.


Don’t just change a single letter or number in a previous password. For example, if your password updates over time are LastName1, LastName2, LastName3, and so on, someone who hacked an old password can just as easily hack a new password.

, A mix of capitals and lowercase letters always helps encrypt passwords and deter hacking. For example, ILoVeNeWyOrK is a harder password to crack than “NewYorkCity.”

, If you have so many different passwords or ones you only use occasionally that you think you’ll have trouble remembering them, write them down on paper, and store the paper some place secure where only you will have access.


Don’t leave paper password back-ups in an unlocked desk or anywhere else that they can be easily taken and misused.

,


Setup a Spread Sheet (Excel, OpenOffice, etc.) to contain the necessary fields (columns) to hold each account identity and password as well as other unique data elements for each account. Password Protect that spreadsheet file.
Use a randomizing program to create Passwords of at least 10 positions in length, using alphabet lower and uppercase, numerals and (allowable) special characters.
The Logon procedure for a given account, say 'PayPal', will be to copy the email address and password from the spreadsheet file to the 'PayPal' logon page.
Never check the option Remember Me on any Logon Page!
This technique requires that you remember only one password, that of the spreadsheet file.
The passwords generated by the randomizing program are complex, impossible to remember, difficult to manually type correctly (especially under the black dots) and equally difficult to 'crack'.
Maintaining the spreadsheet password file on a USB Drive provides mobility between your home desktop, office desktop and your laptop at the local WiFi Cafe. The USB Drive can be physically removed following login for additional security.

Try a name generator.",How to Create a Username," Your username is going to be the first thing people see when they interact with you online. Make sure that you like your own username, because you’ll be seeing it a lot.;
, Different places online may call for different styles of usernames. If you are registering for a professional website, you’ll probably want to use a different username than the gaming forum that you regularly post on.


You may want to break down your internet usage into two different categories: professional and personal interest. You can then use one username for all of your professional websites, and then use one username for all of your personal interest sites. This will make it easier for you to remember your usernames.

, Avoid using any personally identifiable information when creating your username. This includes your first or last name or your birthdate.


Use a variation of your name that is easy for you to remember but difficult for others to associate with your name. Use your seldom-spoken middle name, for example, and spell it backwards.

, Most major online services will already have most standard names already taken. If you are joining an older community, there is a strong chance that the name you want will not be available. Instead of settling for whatever replacement they try to give you, get creative!

, If you're passionate about Brazil, for example, search the net for the names of flowers, warriors, or folk tale characters from the Amazon. If you like fixing up old cars, base your username around your favorite engine or car manufacturer.

, Use a combination of your interests to help you create a unique username. Combine two or more different words together to create a single username. This will help make your name more unique, and increase the chances that you will be able to use it.

, Look up words in other languages. Maybe the username ""Writer"" wasn't available, but its French equivalent ""Ecrivain"" is. You could also use a word from a fantasy language, such as Elvish or Klingon.

, If you’re going to be typing in your username on a regular basis, you’ll appreciate a shorter name! Shorten long words (e.g. turn Mississippi to Miss or Missi) and try to keep the username easy to type.

, Most websites won’t let you use a space in your username, but many will let you use the “_” character to mimic a space. You can also use certain numbers to replace letters, such as “7” instead of “T” or “3” instead of “E”. This is known as “leet speak”, and is typically found in online video gaming circles.


Periods are often used to separate words in usernames as well.
Don’t use your birth year at the end of your username, especially if you are a minor, as it makes it very easy to identify how old you are.

, There are a variety of random name generators available online. These will take various inputs and return a list of randomly-generated names that you can choose from. While this is less personal than creating your own, they work well if you are banging your head against your keyboard trying to think of something original.

"

First, think about your password.,
But, here's something important: don't use the word or phrase as a password hint.,
Think about other words related to that word/in that phrase.,
Now, think about the word you now have.,
Change your password hint.",How to Create a Password Hint That Won't Give Away Your Password to Others," If it is a word, think of playing word association. For example, let's say your password is 'bliss' (but this is an insecure password as it is short and relatively easy to guess.). Are there any words related to that word, or is it in a phrase? For example, the phrase 'ignorance is bliss'.;
, OK, carrying on from the example above, you now have the phrase 'ignorance is bliss'. But if you put that as your password hint, there are 2 extremely obvious words that could be your password, and one of them is right. So...

, The other word you would count in the example is 'ignorance' ('is' has thousands of other words related to it). So from your password 'bliss' you now have the word 'ignorance'.

, Is it a song title, or something similar. 'Ignorance' actually is a song (by Paramore). So, you could learn some of the lyrics. So, from the example, you could get 'If I'm a bad person, you don't like me.' or something similar. So you could put the phrase, or just 'bad person' as your password hint. It's like having a conversation - one minute you're talking about how attractive a celebrity is, then when you're finished talking you'll be on the subject of which people in your school were the meanest.

, Go to the Start Menu, then to Control Panel, then to User Accounts Add or Remove user Accounts. Then click your account, change password, and just fill your current password in on all the password boxes (unless you do want to change your password) and type the password hint in and click 'Done' (or whatever it says ;D).

Avoid using the standard installation option.,
Make sure to pay close attention to the boxes that are displayed on each screen.,
Don’t fall for shades of gray.,
Don’t accept terms and conditions.",How to Keep Your PC Safe from Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs)1," It’s common for PUPs to be associated with programs for video players and video conversion programs, but they can also lurk in other software like antivirus programs and games. Whatever you are downloading to your computer, it’s important that you don't get tricked by the false sense of security these install wizards tend to emit. During the beginning of the installation, everything seems pretty harmless, making you trigger happy as the process moves along, and it is this lull in your awareness that can be exploited.;
, One way to avoid falling victim to the presets of installing wizards that exploit users via its free downloads is to do a custom installation. Using the standard installation option seems like the way to go, especially when you aren’t familiar with installation processes. However, this is where PUPs infiltrate your PC. This option may also be called express installation or default installation. It’s easy to fall for this, especially when you only see the program you’re trying to install.  


Note the problematic add-ons. After choosing the custom installation selection, you may see options appear beneath it that ask about installing toolbars or setting homepages – all of which you didn’t see before and wouldn’t have until they were already installed on your PC. The funny thing is that the add-ons that are featured on these wizards have nothing to do with what you’re downloading.  
Be wise to the trick leading you to use what they recommend. Another way people are tricked into using standard installation settings is because next to it, it says ""recommended"", while next to custom, it says advanced. By believing that the custom installation is for advanced people, it scares you away from selecting that option. But in reality, the process is rather simple.

, As you’re moving along your installation of the software, you may notice a window that asks you to either accept or not accept an offer; however, the “do not accept” option is gray. This automatically leads you to think that you can’t select it. But don’t fall for this trick because it is indeed clickable. The programmers simply grayed it out, so that people would think they had no choice.

, Read the fine print! Another way these PUPs bombard their way onto your PC is by leaving you with no option. As in in the previous step, windows appear during the installation process that ask you whether you want to install a certain program. But there’s nowhere to say no or you’re unable to uncheck the option to install it. However, when you get to the window that asks you to accept the terms and conditions, you can uncheck this box and the program will not install. By reading the fine print, you will see any hidden agendas that come with this free software. Here, you will find other programs that are attached to the installation. This could help you to see what’s lurking in the software before you install it.

Immunet: This antivirus software specializes in protecting your PC from spyware and viruses. It is based in the cloud, allowing it to work quickly to find and remove potentially harmful programs.
AVG: Once you install this software, protection from spyware and PUPs is already turned on. It works by detecting programs that could be potential security threats. It may even halt programs that are harmless, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. This is especially so since trusted programs are being used to harness PUPs.
Avast: This is free software that can protect your PC from PUPs. It’s important to turn on all three protection shields that are offered: File System Shield, Web Shield and Mail Shield. Make sure to enable the PUP protection, since by default it is turned off.

Keep Windows updated.",How to Install an Antivirus1," Windows is the most virus-prone operating system (OS) out of the three major OSes. It has the most users and the weakest built-in security. Antivirus programs will defend your computer from malware that comes through email, flash drives, downloads, websites and more.;
, There are several popular free options available that do a good job of protecting the average user. These programs are updated frequently with new virus definitions that recognize the latest threats.


If you frequently deal with files or websites that are virus-infected, you may want to opt for more powerful paid protection. Paid antivirus programs are typically available for a yearly subscription fee.
When downloading free or paid antivirus programs, ensure that you are downloading from a trusted source. There are many programs out there that claim to be antivirus/antimalware but instead install malware themselves. Read reviews and download products from companies that have been around for a long time.

, Make sure that no other programs are running while you install the antivirus. You will most likely need to be connected to the internet to download additional files and updates.


Some free antivirus programs come packaged with toolbars for your web browser. These can add protection but also change your search options and bog down older computers. You have the opportunity to opt out of these changes during the installation process.

, After the installation is complete, reboot your computer and update the program. The file that you downloaded is likely not the most up to date version, so you will need to connect to your antivirus program’s servers and download the latest updates. Most antivirus programs allow you to right-click on the icon in the System Tray while it is running and click Update.


Update your definitions on a weekly basis. Most antivirus programs are set to automatically update. Double check the settings for your program to ensure that you are receiving the necessary updates.

, Once you have the program installed and updated, it’s time to scan your computer. This could take several hours, depending on the number of files being scanned and your computer’s speed.

, Antivirus programs are most effective when they are automated. Open your antivirus program’s settings and look for the Schedule option. Try to schedule a time when your computer will be on but you won’t be using it. Ideally you should be scanning once a week; scan more frequently if you deal with potentially infected files on a regular basis.

, The best way to keep your computer protected is to always make sure that your copy of Windows is up to date. Microsoft releases security updates for Windows on a regular basis, fixing exploitable areas of Windows.

Update Mac OS X. Apple releases security patches on a regular basis to close any exploits that have been discovered.",How to Install an Antivirus2," Mac OS X has long been much more secure than Windows, due to the way that the system software has been designed. In the past, less people used Mac OS, which lead to less viruses being developed for Mac. While the population of Mac users has increased dramatically, it is still not as popular as Windows, which is where the majority of virus development happens.


The most important use for antivirus on Mac is stopping the spread of malware to other computers. Viruses are very easily spread through email, and while you may not get infected yourself, you can spread the virus to other computers that may not have the same protection as your Mac.

, Because of the low chance of infection on your machine, there is little need to get a paid antivirus solution. Instead, download a free option that is designed from the ground up to work with Mac OS X.

, Because the risk of infection is low, you don’t necessarily need to constantly scan your system. Instead, use your antivirus program to manually inspect suspicious files and emails.

, Keep your Mac up to date to ensure that your system is as secure as possible.

The most important use for antivirus on Linux is stopping the spread of malware to other computers. Viruses are very easily spread through email, and while you may not get infected yourself, you can spread the virus to other computers that may not have the same protection as your Linux machine.

, Check with your repository to see what antivirus options are available for your Linux build. Most builds have antivirus programs available as freeware. These programs have been vetted by the Linux community and are designed to take minimal system resources.

, Because the risk of infection is low, you don’t necessarily need to constantly scan your system. Instead, use your antivirus program to manually inspect suspicious files and emails.

, Updating system software with Linux updates all of your program builds as well, eradicating any exploits that have been found. The process is mostly automated. Be sure to check your settings to ensure that your Linux installation is updating appropriately.

Determine whether or not your computer is in fact subject to a keylogging malware.,
If you have answered 'yes' to any of the questions in step 1, it is highly probable that you have a keylogging malware installed onto your computer.,
For a more thorough approach, identify a keylogging malware with the 'netstat' method.,
As you can see, you are currently in the C:\WINDOWS\system32> directory.,
What you see now are the active connections on this computer.,
Check the software names closely.,
If you have found something suspicious, you are about to take care of it.,
At this stage, you will have to cross reference the PIDs from your command prompt screen, with those on your Task Manager.,
As you've noticed, the image computer does not have any malware running on the PC.,
Delete the malware.,
Done.,
Take preventative measures in future.",How to Identify and Remove Keylogging Malware from Your Windows 8 Computer," Start with some probing questions:

Have any of your account passwords been compromised?
Have any of your account passwords been compromised, even after changing your password several times?
Have you experienced a slowdown in your computer's performance not explained by other potential factors?
Has your web cam been turned on without your doing, or without using a face-time type software (such as Skype)?;
, To identify a keylogging malware, you have a few options. A less intuitive choice would be to download a spyware or keylogger detector program. For example, here is a list of services with download links: http://download.cnet.com/1772-20_4-0.html?query=keylogger+detector&platform=Windows%2CMac%2CiOS%2CAndroid%2CWebware%2CMobile&searchtype=downloads.


Note: If you use a very simple password, or share passwords with another person, you may not have any malware issues (this will be further discussed below under preventative measures).

, To do so, you will need to run your command prompt as an administrator.


On a Windows 8 machine, use your 'window' hotkey+S. This will open your search tab on your right hand side.
Enter: 'cmd' into the query bar.
Left click on CMD, and run as administrator.

, You need to change your current working directory to your C:\ root directory, and display your current running processes with netstat. To do this:


Type: cd \
Press enter.
Type: netstat -b
Press enter.

, In the introduction, it was explained that keylogging malware will send collected data to the the malware's owner. In order to do so, the malware requires an active connection. As you can see in the image, under the 'State' column, all of the current processes are established, which means that there is an active connection.

, While you're viewing this page, you will have an established connection. This connection will coincide with whatever internet browser you're using. Circled in the picture, you can see that this computer is currently running an instance of chrome.exe (Google Chrome). This is the important part––what you'll what to do now is go through the established connections while closely examining the names of the software that are currently displayed. What you're doing now is looking for a suspicious software name, or a current browser name that would be slightly deviated from the normal name. For example: instead of , we would have or .

, If you are still unsure, here are the PID (process IDs) of each process, which you will cross reference with your Task Manager.


In your command prompt, Type: netstat -ano
Press enter.
To open your Task Manager, press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.
Once Task Manager is open, click: More Details, then click the details tab.

, This is essentially just to confirm that your computer is running services with active connections that are not harmful. As circled in the image, PID #4764 corresponds with the Google Chrome on Task Manager. You can now conclude that this active connection is harmless.

, Let's say you had a known malware displayed in netsat, called 'Backdoor.Alvgus.a.exe'. To find out what you're dealing with, go to www.spywareguide.net, and search their database for a description of this malware.

, This is rather simple. For demonstrative purposes, assume that Firefox is the malware that found running on your computer, and you would like to delete it.


In the details tab, locate Firefox.
Left click on it, and select 'Open File Location'.
In Task Manager, left click on Firefox again, and click 'End Task'.
Go back to the file location, and navigate to the parent folder (in this case, just click on ProgramFiles(x86) in the search bar above.
Now delete the Firefox folder
Go to your recycling bin, and permanently delete the folder.

, Your virus should be all gone. It is recommended that you restart your computer and go through the same steps to see if the malware is still running once you reboot, just to be sure.

, The number one cause for you to have any type of malware installed on your computer is carelessness. It is imperative that you do not download anything from untrusted sites, or click on any links that you are unsure of. It is also recommended that you change your password every 6 weeks. Do not share your passwords, and do not rush through software installations.

If you are unsure about software, do an online search for feedback about the software from other people, or ask in relevant forums for advice.

Choose a password that no one will easily guess or hack.,
Do not share passwords.,
Make sure your password is long.,
Use at least one capital letter and one lowercase letter in your password.,
Use spaces in your password.,
Generate similar but distinct passwords for separate accounts.,
Make sure your password is written down and kept in a safe place.",How to Create a Secure Password1," Don't use a word or phrase of special importance to you—like a birthday or family member. That's the kind of information that can be discovered by someone doing a little digging.;
, This is an open invitation to your online accounts, and it's often exploited to accomplish online identity theft.

, It should be at least eight-to-10 characters long, and longer passwords are even more secure. Some sites or applications may limit the password length, however.

, The capital and lowercase letters should not be grouped together. Mixing them up makes the password more difficult to predict. This kind of strategy might lead to ""JeCaMiJe_"" in the first example or ""HouseOnSpooner#1500"" in the second example.

, Many password systems don't allow actual spaces, but it can be useful to insert one into the middle of a password with systems that do. Alternatively, an underscore ""_"" or two can serve a similar function.

, You can use similar base words to help you remember your passwords easily without making them too easy to crack. So ""JeCaMiJe_"" might be modified as ""my kids JeCaMiJe,"" ""HouseOnSpooner#1500"" might become ""1500*my first House On Snooper.""

, Choose a location away from your computer (and from prying eyes), but make sure you can easily access it. If you forget your password, you can retrieve it without much trouble.


When writing your password down, consider coding it with an offset pattern to make your password more difficult for others to decipher. Thus ri7%Gi6_ll might be written as 2tk9&Ik8_nn (where the offset for the coding is indicated by the first character, in this case +2). This would mean that each subsequent coded character is two alphabetical letters or numbers greater than the actual password character.

"
"
Create a sentence or phrase as the basis for your password.,
Use your sentence or statement to craft an easily memorable password.,
Create a complex but memorable sequence of words and/or letters.,
Use at least one letter, number and special character in your password.,
Memorize your secure password.,
Consider using your computer's Character Map/Character Palette to (optionally) insert special characters into your password.,
Remember to update and vary passwords.",How to Create a Secure Password2," This is a useful starting point for making a password that's complex and difficult to guess while easy for you to remember. Also remember that your password should ultimately be lengthy (at least eight to 10 characters) and include a wide variety of character types (upper and lower case letters, numbers, spaces or underscores, etc.). While you should stay away from personally relevant information that others could easily identify, it's still convenient to create a password that you can recall without much trouble. Crafting a statement or sentence that will stick with you can serve as a useful basis for your password.


One example of a mnemonic device is the Person-Action-Object (PAO) method developed by Carnegie Mellon computer scientists. Simply select an image or photograph of a memorable person performing an action with or to an object—and then put them all together to construct a phrase (however amusing or nonsensical). By selecting characters (e.g. the first three letters of each word) from said phrase, you can develop a password that's readily recalled.

, By taking certain letters from your phrase, you can assemble a password that's easy to remember (e.g. by using the first two or three letters from each word in your phrase and putting them together in order). Make sure your statement or sentence includes upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters.

, You can use a phrase or series of letters that is seemingly random but nevertheless easy to remember. The easily memorized series of letters can form a ""base word"" to which you should add symbols or numbers.


If your children are Jessie, Cassey, Michael and Jenny, your base word might be ""jecamije""—the first two letters of each name combined. If your first house was on Spooner Street, a base word might be ""houseonspooner.""

, So you could add an underscore (or other random punctuation) and numbers to create ""jecamije_."" Or you can add a symbol to the word to make ""houseonspooner#1500.""

, For example, a sentence like ""My mother was born in Kansas City, Missouri on January 27th"" might become a password like MmwbiKC,MOoJ27. Or a sentence like ""The radio show begins at 9:10 AM on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays"" could become ""Trsb@0910oM,W&F.""

, Windows can find these options under the Start Menu by clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, clicking System Tools and finally selecting Character Map. Mac users simply need to select Edit at the top of their browser menu and subsequently select Special Characters at the bottom of the Edit menu. You can then replace some of your letters with special symbols to make your password more difficult to guess.


These symbols can replace more commonly used characters, but it's worth noting that some sites' password system won't accept all of the available symbols. By way of example, ""ЅϋΠЅЂιηξ"" could be used to replace ""Sunshine.""
Remember that you'll have to actually re-enter this password when attempting to access a website or application, so consider the difficulty associated with repeatedly accessing your character map when entering passwords. You may decide it's too much of a hassle.

, You shouldn't be using the same passwords across your various logins, and you shouldn't use the same password for more than a few months at a time.

"
"
Select a password management program.,
Download and install a password manager.,
Set up your password manager.,
Customize your preferences.",How to Create a Secure Password3," This software will generally allow you to automatically handle a wide variety of passwords (for applications and websites) by simply entering one ""master"" password—significantly more simple., Specific instructions will vary depending on which program you select, so be sure to follow instructions carefully. Generally speaking, you'll need to visit the appropriate vendor website and click a ""download"" button before following the installation instructions associated with your operating system.

, Again, the process will vary depending on the specific program. But the basic idea is to set up a complex master password that allows the production and/or maintenance of multiple, site and application-specific passwords to access their destinations. Most popular programs are pretty user-friendly when it comes to core functionality.

, Most of the best password managers will give you the option to either use your master password locally or synced across a variety of devices, so be prepared to determine what works best for you. You can also generally decide whether you wish the program to automatically log you in to sites and whether it audits your distinct passwords to ensure they're sufficiently different and changed on a regular basis.
