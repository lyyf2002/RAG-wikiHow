Uninstall any unfamiliar programs.,
Start a scan with your anti-malware program.",How to Get Rid of Trojan Horses," Trojans have a nasty habit of infecting your System Restore points, which can cause your computer to continue to get infected, even after you remove the virus.Open your System properties. You can access this by right-clicking on Computer and selecting Properties. In Windows 8, press the Windows key + X and select System.
Click the “System protection” link.
Click the Configure button.
Disable system protection and delete all of the restore points saved on your computer. This will ensure that the virus does not replicate through System Restore. You can re-enable System Restore once the virus has been removed.;
, There are several good free options available, including Malwarebytes or Avast!. You may have better luck with a paid program, as they tend to have more definitions that they can use to detect viruses.

, Reboot your computer and repeatedly hit the F8 key until the Advanced Boot menu appears. Select Safe Mode, or Safe Mode with Networking if you want to be able to download files during the removal process.

, Trojans often install programs that you didn’t approve. Once you are in Safe mode, open the Control Panel and select Add/Remove Programs or Programs and Features. Browse the list for any programs that you did not authorize and uninstall them., Depending on the number of files on your computer, this could take up to several hours. Depending on the virus you may be presented with several results:


Your scan may detect a virus and successfully remove it. If this happens, run the scan again in Safe Mode. If nothing is detected, reboot your computer and run the scan again after booting normally. If the virus is not detected, you are most likely in the clear.
Your scan may detect a virus but be unable to remove it. If this happens, copy the exact name of the virus and enter it into the search at one of the major antivirus companies, such as Norton or Kaspersky. You should be able to find removal instructions specific to the virus you are infected with.
Your scan may not detect anything. If this happens, install a different anti-malware program and try scanning again. If the second anti-malware program does not return any results, and you are sure that your computer is infected with some sort of virus, backup your data and reformat your system. Major antivirus companies may be willing to work with you one-on-one to identify and remove the virus if their program does not detect it."

Malwarebytes Antimalware - malwarebytes.org


Junkware Removal Tool - thisisudax.org/


HitmanPro - surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro


, AdwCleaner is a straightforward scanning program. Simply install it, run it, and click the ""Scan"" button. The scanning process may take a few minutes.


Once the scan is complete, click the ""Clean"" button to remove all of the objects that AdwCleaner found.

, When you run the program for the first time, you will be prompted to update. Make sure to update before scanning. Once the program has been updated, click ""Scan Now"". The scan may take a little while to complete.


After the scan has completed, click ""Quarantine All"" and then """"Apply Actions"".
You will likely be prompted to reboot.

, You may be prompted by Windows to allow the program to run. Once the program is running, a Command Prompt window will appear. Press any key on your keyboard to start scanning.


A Notepad window will open after the scan which lists all of the objects removed during the scan.

, If you don't want HitmanPro to scan your system every time it starts, uncheck the option during installation. You can also choose to forgo installation completely, and run HitmanPro as a one-time scanner.


After the scan has completed, click Next and then select ""Activate free license"". This will remove the found objects.

, Strange things can happen when a computer reboots, so it's always a good idea to reboot once and then run each scan again. The scanners may detect things they couldn't before.After you've' finished running scans and everything is coming up clean, move on to the next section.

Download a bootable antivirus.,
Install the antivirus to a bootable media.,
Disconnect the media from your computer.,
Turn off your computer.,
Access the Advance Boot Options.,
Boot into Safe mode.,
Connect your external media.,
Scan for viruses.,
Delete the viruses.,
Restart your computer.",How to Get Rid of Ransomware," Bootable antiviruses are anti-malware applications that can be installed and run on an external storage like a flash drive or a CD.


Links for common bootable antivirus applications used can be found on the “Sources and Citations” section at the end of this guide. All you need to do is to click the “Download” button from your chosen link to get the installer.
Assuming that the ransomware has already blocked your access to your own computer, you may need to download and install the bootable antivirus on a different PC.;
, Connect the external media where you want to install the antivirus and click the downloaded file, the antivirus will start installing itself on your preferred external media.


Depending on the application you downloaded, you can install the bootable antivirus on a CD or a flash drive, but it’s advisable that you use the latter for easier access because not all PCs have disc drive (like netbooks).

, Once the antivirus has been successfully installed, safely unplug the flash drive from the USB port or remove the CD from the disc drive.

, Since you can’t shut off your computer normally, press and hold the power button up until the CPU shuts down.

, Press the Power button once again to turn on your computer and as soon as the CPU lights up, press the F8 button on your keyboard and keep doing so until the “Advance Boot Option” appears on your screen.

, Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to scroll down and select “Safe Mode with Networking” from the list of boot options. Press the Enter key on the keyboard and your computer will restart.


What Safe mode does is that it allows your computer to run using only the most basic and necessary program without using third-party applications, including the viruses. This way, any malware that may exist in your PC will stay inactive and can be easily removed.

, Plug in the flash drive into the USB port or place the CD in the disc drive that contains the bootable antivirus application.

, Once the external storage has been detected, open My Computer and run the antivirus inside the bootable media. The application should begin scanning for any viruses or ransomware that may be in your computer system.

, Once the antivirus application finishes scanning, click the “Delete” button of the antivirus to permanently remove the malware from your computer.

, Click the “Start/Orb” button on the bottom left corner of the screen and select the “Restart” button to reboot the computer.


If you can now access your computer again normally (without going into safe mode), it means that the ransomware has been successfully deleted.

, Pages like processlibrary.com or neuber.com are good at identifying malicious processes. , Delete the executable and any associated files. If an error message saying it is in use, stop the process using task manager and try again.

, And if any duplicates appear in the search results, Take CARE to only delete the suspect file that is not where it should be i.e. not in C:\WINDOWS\System32. When identified as malicious, delete the executable and associated files as before.

, and Smiley Central. By not installing/downloading these programs you minimize the amount of adware/spyware you get. Delete these programs first.

, AdAware is a bit easier and is recommended for inexperienced users. NOTE: These programs will catch what the other misses so install both.

Memorize a few names of ""legit"" antiviruses.,
Memorize a few names of rogue antiviruses as well.,
Don't be taken in by instant online scans.,
Be careful.,
When you think you have downloaded a rogue antivirus, another good way to tell is to open the legit Windows Security Center (if you have Windows).,
Never trust or use an online scan.,
When you download one of the legit antiviruses that was put in the 1st step, make sure you don't download from random sites.,
Beware of sites you go to!,
Detect most rogues anti-virus and remove them by a good functional FREE program like ""MalwareBytes Antimalware"": (when installing their free version, you have a choice to click their ""trial version"", but that is not the free version; so to get to the free one, say ""no"" to the ""trial"").",How to Distinguish Between a 'Rogue Antivirus' and a 'Legit' One," This way you may know which is rogue and which is legit. A few legit antiviruses are McAfee, AVG, Avast!, Norton, and Kaspersky. Some of these are free (like Avast and AVG) and some of these have a trial version and a paid version (like Norton or McAfee).;
, Here is an incomplete list of rogue antiviruses that you can find on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rogue_security_software

, Some rogues use fake Windows Security Center alerts or popup ads that mimic Windows notifications or claim to have scanned your computer. The people who make them are crafty. If there is a ""Don't Download"" or ""Cancel"" button on the fake error message, don't click it; that would still download it. If something like that happens, it's not too late- go to Recycle Bin and delete the rogue and do a hard shutdown (press and hold power button on computer for 10 seconds) immediately. (Legit antiviruses don't use these ways of advertising.)


Most rogues have extremely outrageous security results. Most legit antiviruses are honest and don't point out these non-existent viruses. On the contrary, rogue antiviruses claim that critical system processes (such as Task Manager) are viruses. This is because programs such as Task Manager can cut off its function, making it vulnerable.
Some rogue antiviruses claim that the money you pay goes to a charitable cause. Green Antivirus, a rogue, claims that $2 of the money you paid goes to a foundation to protect the Amazon Rainforests.

, Rogues can make you pay a lot of money for the fake!

, If the ""Antivirus"" section was red and ""OFF"" -- but now has a green circle with ""ON"" written next to it, the program is legit. If it still says ""OFF,"" chances are this software is a rogue (although the good free antivirus is not necessarily known by Windows).





, If there are links that redirect to an online virus scan. DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO CLICK ON THEM.





, There are some sites that download rogues which pretend to be McAfee, Avast, and AVG.

, A website, GOGGLE.com (which pretends to be GOOGLE.com) downloads a rogue called Spy-Sheriff without your permission.





, The totally FREE shareware ""SpyBot Search&Destroy"" is also a good detector of the rogue malware antivirus. Either may be downloaded FREE for example at majorgeeks.com without joining, or at cnet.com, if you join to download software -- both longstanding sites that have tested/scanned programs.

, Some keylogger programs, such as Refog, actively prevent uninstallation. Check on internet forums such as BleepingComputer to see how you can remove the program without breaking your computer.

,


Many keylogger programs hook deep into your operating system, meaning that attempts at removing them might break your computer or cause instabilities. In these cases, a reinstall might be easier and cause fewer headaches.
Sometimes, it can be hard to remove a keylogger program using antimalware alone. A reinstall would take care of the keylogger without you needing to put in as much effort.
You should reinstall your operating system if you have detected a keylogger on a computer that you plan to use for bank transactions or dealing with trade secrets, because the keylogger might not have been completely removed.

Determine what operating system you are going to attack.,
Decide how you want it to spread.,
Determine the weak spot that you want to target.,
Decide what you want your virus to do.,
Choose a language.,
Start writing your virus.,
Research ways to hide your code.,
Test your virus.,
Release your virus.",How to Create a Virus," The most common target is Microsoft Windows, especially older versions. Many old Windows users do not update their operating system, leaving them vulnerable to security holes that may be fixed in newer versions.


Mac OS X and Linux are both fairly virus-proof due to the way permissions work and the general architecture of the operating system. 95% of all viruses target Windows users.;
, A virus is only a virus if it can spread to other users. You will need to figure out the delivery method before beginning, as it is one of the fundamentals of the virus's code. Common delivery mechanisms include:


Executable file (.EXE, .BAT, .COM etc.) - This program needs to be run by the user, and is often disguised as something else (such as an image).
Macro (Microsoft Office) - Macros are programs that are embedded into a document or email. They target Word, Outlook, and other macro-enabled products. The most common method of delivery is via email with an infected document attached.
Web script - These are pieces of malicious code that are injected into sites without the webmasters' knowledge., Successful viruses exploit weak spots in a program's or system's security to spread and carry out their actions. This requires a lot of research and know how, but there are communities out there that can help you find what you need.

, Once your virus has infected a system, what do you want it to do? Effects can range from nothing, to displaying a message, to deleting files, and much worse. Be aware that creating and spreading a malicious virus is a serious crime in most countries.

, In order to create a virus, you will need to have at least a basic understanding of at least one computer language or scripting tool. More complex viruses often involve several languages. For really effective viruses, you will need to be familiar with assembly languages.


If you're interested in making executable viruses, C or C++ is a good place to start.
If you want to make macro viruses, learn the macro language for your target programs such as Microsoft Office.

Visual Basic can be used to create malicious programs for Windows users.

, This will be a long process, especially if this is your first time coding something. Experiment as much as possible, and research ways to replicate your code depending on the language you are using. There are tutorials on forums and community blogs for a variety of languages.


Research polymorphic code. This will alter the code of your virus every time it replicates, making it difficult to track with antivirus programs. Polymorphic code is fairly advanced, and is implemented differently in every language.

, Besides polymorphic coding, there are other ways to hide your virus. Encryption is a very common tool used by virus developers. It takes a lot of practice and reading, but it can go a long way in increasing the lifespan of your virus.

, Once you have a prototype up and running, test it out on as many different machines and setups as possible. This will be easiest if you are able to set up virtual machines in different configurations.


Make sure that you keep your tests contained so that you don't accidentally release your virus before you are ready. Put the test machines on an isolated network and see the effects of the virus spreading.
Adjust your virus's code as you observe it working on the test machines. Fix any issues that it runs into

, If you're satisfied with your virus's performance, it's time to release it. Before you do, however, ask yourself if you're prepared to face any consequences that may come from releasing a virus into the wild. It may be better to use that experience and work on new projects."

In terms of free software, many sources recommend one of the following: (choose one)

avast! Home Edition
Avira Free Antivirus
Panda Cloud Antivirus
AVG AntiVirus Free
Immunet Free Antivirus


Avast! is lightest on system resources, while Avira Antivir has the highest detection rates. Avira AntiVir pops up an ad after updating, but there are ways to remove it.
If you insist on paying, F-Secure Antivirus, Kaspersky Anti-Virus, and Bitdefender Antivirus Plus are all viable options that balance detection ratesand system resource usage.;
, While antivirus software will also remove spyware and/or adware, an antispyware/adware product is recommended for on-demand scanning. The following are good options (choose at least one).



MalwareBytes Anti-Malware if you get the premium version you will have great realtime malware and virus protection so there is no need to run a separate antivirus program. Running multiple AV programs slows down your computer and drains your devices battery quicker
SUPERAntiSpyware
AdwCleaner has the best detection rate in my personal experience

, While many people stick with the Windows Firewall that comes with Windows, that one isn't very good at blocking malware that is already on your computer from calling home.



ZoneAlarm Firewall is probably the most popular.
The Sygate Firewall used to be one of the best, but is no longer free, so Comodo Firewall seems to be the best choice. It can be intrusive, so make sure to use the 'Scan for Known Applications' feature.

Sunbelt-Kerio Personal Firewall is also a good choice.
If money is not a problem for you, feel free to download the paid version of these products or Norton Internet Security which includes the Sygate Firewall.
Make sure to disable the Windows Firewall if using a separate one.

, While Internet Explorer 6 comes with many computers, it is the least safe browser to use!


If you don't feel comfortable using other programs (Internet Explorer is the most simple), then at least upgrade to the newest version.
The most popular secure browsers are Firefox (known for its customizability), Opera (prepackaged with several features and good for slow connections), and Google Chrome (very light out of the box).

To keep viruses out of your computer, you must use a virus scanner that offers real-time protection. This means that it continuously monitors files being opened for containing a virus. If that is the case, the virus scanner immediately notifies the user and renders the virus harmless.
These offer added user friendliness and further functions for your online protection, like:
- real-time antivirus scanning,

Due to the way most modern browsers work, there are very few ways for you to get infected with something online UNLESS you click on it yourself. This means you should avoid clicking on banners for offers that are too good to be true.


Make sure your browser is configured to always ask before running files and downloading automatically. If you have to confirm everything, you are much less likely to get infected.;
, Some of the most nefarious popups on the internet are designed to mimic the look of legitimate anti-virus software. These popups attempt to trick the user into thinking their antivirus software has found an infection. When you click the popup, however, the adware is actually installed.


Instead of clicking the warning, close the popup window and open the antivirus program on your computer. You most likely will not see any warnings. If you are still worried, run a scan using your installed software.
Don't try clicking the ""X"" to close the popup window, as this will usually lead to more popups. Instead, use the Task Manager to get rid of it.Alternatively you can install adblock plus to prevent ads appearing in the first placeOther popups may warn of an infection that only their software can fix. No legitimate antivirus company will advertise their product this way, so avoid clicking on any of these popups.
Check to ensure that your browser is configured to block popups.

, Popups can store information in your browser's cache, leading to them reappearing constantly. To help prevent this, clear your browser’s cache regularly.

, If you are using Internet Explorer or an older browser such as Netscape or Safari for Windows, you may be leaving yourself exposed to security risks. Browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, and Opera are much more secure than older browsers, and more customizable. Firefox, for example, has a large array of privacy- and security-related add-ons that will help protect you online.


If you don't want to switch browsers, make sure that it is always up to date to help prevent unauthorized attacks.

, As viruses are illegal, they thrive on other illegal sites. Avoid sites that let you download copyrighted content or other illegal communities. File sharing is a quick way to get infected files. You will find that your computer is much less prone to infection if you avoid things you shouldn't be doing.


Besides viruses from files you download, many of these sites will have a litany of annoying popups and misleading advertisements. All of these could lead to virus and spyware infection.

, There are programs available for nearly every task you can think of, but ask yourself if you really need the program that you are about to download. Do a little research about your task; you may find that you already have a program capable of what you want to do. Downloading extra programs for every task you want to complete increases the likelihood that you'll download something malicious., If you are downloading a program or other piece of software, it is always advisable to try to download it from the developer's site as opposed to a download service. Many of these services install their own download managers, and can infect your browser with adware.


Downloading illegal files or watching pornography will always be a lottery when it comes to getting viruses and worms. If you can, download from ""trusted"" sources in the community to reduce the risk of infection.

, Mischievous files often have fake extensions designed to trick you, such as "".txt.vb"" or "".jpg.exe"". Windows will often hide common file extensions to make browsing through your files and programs more visually appealing. Double extensions exploit this by hiding the second, dangerous extension. If you normally don't see extensions on your computer and it all of a sudden appears on a file that you've downloaded, you may have downloaded a malicious file that is hiding as something else.


To make your file extensions visible, open Windows Explorer, click the View tab/menu and select Options. Click the View tab in the Folder Options window, and uncheck the ""Hide extensions for known file types"" box.

, If you have an antivirus program installed, you should make a habit of scanning files that you've downloaded from unknown locations. Most antivirus programs allow you to immediately scan specific files by right-clicking on the file and selecting your antivirus from the list of options.


Always scan ZIP files as these often contain multiple files in one archive.
Email programs will often scan your email files for viruses automatically, but you should still scan any downloaded files with your own antivirus program.

, A virus or worm can do nothing unless you actually run the program that it is attached to. That means that simply downloading a file does not put you in any real danger. If you decide after downloading that you don't exactly trust the file, avoid opening it or delete it until you can confirm its integrity.

, You know those legal documents that you always blindly accept when installing a program? Well, shady companies like to use the fact that most people skip them to sneak in clauses about installing spyware and other malicious software. Make sure to take the time to read these agreements, especially from companies that you've never heard of before.

, Email attachments are the number 1 way that viruses and other malware get spread. You should never click an attachment or link in an email from someone you don't recognize. If you are unsure of the sender, get confirmation from them that the file is legitimate before downloading it.

, Many times people will get infected with viruses that send emails without their knowledge. This means you can receive email from trusted sources but the email itself is not trustworthy. If the writing is odd or the attachment looks off, do not click it. Verify with the person that they intended to send you the attachment you received.

, Many email applications can automatically load images for convenience, but this can leave you more vulnerable, as images can contain malicious code. You should only download the images in an email from a trusted source.


Note: Some services have started changing way email images are handled, making image loading safer. For example, Gmail no longer disables images on default. Check with your mail provider for the best practices on their service.

, A popular phishing technique is to copy the style of a company email and include links that look similar to the regular URL, but instead send you to a fake site (""povver"" instead of ""power"", for example). These sites then collect personal information that you though was going to a trusted server.


Any legitimate company will never ask you for passwords or other personal information through email., An antivirus program will actively protect your computer from virus infections by scanning active programs and performing scheduled full-system scans. There are free antivirus programs that come with basic virus protection, such as AVG, Bitdefender, and Avast, and there are paid programs that come with other internet security protections such as firewalls and anti-phishing measures. Paid programs include Norton, Kaspersky, and paid versions of free antivirus options.


You should only have one antivirus installed at a time in order to avoid conflicts between them.
Make sure that your antivirus gets updated at least every week.
Scan your computer at least weekly, more often if you are heavy internet user.
An antivirus program is not a foolproof system, and should not replace good browsing habits and common sense., Beyond viruses, your computer can also get infected with spyware and adware. These programs are difficult to exterminate and often hijack your browsing experience. They also make your computer more susceptible to future infection. Most antivirus programs do not scan for or remove spyware and adware.


Popular programs include Malwarebytes, Spybot S&D, HitmanPro, and Adw Cleaner.
You can have multiple anti-spyware programs installed at once. More programs means you are more likely to catch offending spyware.

, Firewall software protects your networks ports, which are the ""doors"" facing the internet that allow data to be sent back and forth. Windows comes with firewall software already installed and enabled, which is usually more than enough for most home users. There are a variety of companies that offer more powerful and customizable software as well. Most of these are the same companies that provide paid antivirus software.


Firewalls are also available in hardware form.
You can only have one firewall enabled at a time. If you install a software or hard firewall, you'll need to disable the Windows firewall.

, Many viruses and other malicious programs exploit holes in the Windows software. These holes are quickly patched by Microsoft, and updates are made available for all legitimate copies of Windows. if you don't keep your copy of Windows updated, your system will be much more exposed. In order to ensure that you're always protected, make sure that Windows is set to update automatically.If you are using Windows XP, upgrade immediately. Support for Windows XP will end on April 8, 2014. This means that any exploitable cracks found after that date will no longer be fixed, and Windows XP will become very insecure. For more information on upgrading, see this article for upgrading to Windows 7, and this article for upgrading to Windows 8.

, USB drives are a popular vehicle for virus transmissions, usually without the owner being aware at all. You could get an infection just by inserting the USB drive, or could get your USB drive infected by plugging it into a public computer. Try to use other methods for file sharing, such as online storage or email to send files.

, In our more connected world, remote access and remote sharing of resources has become much more prevalent. While this can be great for productivity, it does put your personal machine at more risk if there are a variety of other machines connecting directly to it. Ask yourself if you need that remote connection, and always ensure that your protection software is up to date.

, If disaster strikes, you don't want to be left without your important data. A regular backup schedule will mitigate any damage done by a virus, and will allow you to get up and running much quicker. There are a variety of ways that you can go about backing up your data, both locally and remotely."

Help your antivirus out.",How to Avoid Getting a Virus Through Email," More often than not, simply knowing what you shouldn't open from the start will afford you a huge amount of protection; since the virus and malware industry is constantly changing and adapting to users' awareness, it pays to take a look at current delivery methods., Some examples of common email hoaxes include people asking you for personal information so that they can give you money, links from strangers to funny or engaging media, and invitations to take advantage of discounts on adult entertainment or enhancement. Simply opening any one of these types of email can infect your computer, so if it seems suspicious, just delete it.

, If you receive an email from an antivirus program telling you your computer has been infected, make sure you verify the information through your antivirus software before opening the email; these programs are less likely to correspond through email than interface messages., Since content previews give you a glimpse of the content in the email--minimizing your need to click on the email to ascertain its subject matter--you might benefit from turning on text previews in your chosen email service.

, Any modern, well-maintained email service such as Gmail or Outlook is a good starting place, and you can further customize your email service's security settings once you establish your account. As a general rule, you shouldn't use ad-heavy email services such as Yahoo.


If you're using an email service that allows it, consider loading your emails in plain text. This reduces the chances that a virus can proliferate your computer through visual media to virtually zero., You should refrain from entering your email address into any site that isn't encrypted; even if the site holds up, viruses and malware can still snag your address, making it easy for them to send a fake email with a virus your way.

, If an email in your inbox doesn't have a known recipient or a relevant subject, send it to the trash without opening it. Similarly, anything from a site or a service that you don't use or subscribe to should go.In the event that you do open an email from an unknown source, don't download or click on anything in the email, especially not without scanning the contents first with an antivirus program.

, Links, in particular, can place you at great risk for contracting a computer virus. Unless you're absolutely certain of the validity of an email, refrain from clicking on any links from within the message. The same goes for any link in your browser, especially when they appear to be placed out of context.

, Again, modern and well-maintained sites that correlate with your email client are your best options--for example, you might use Google Chrome with Gmail or Microsoft Edge with Outlook. Not only will this synchronization vastly improve your browsing experience, you'll seal up any potential loopholes from incompatible plug-ins or software.


It's not a bad idea to customize your email and browser security settings. Most services will allow you to set the strictness of your junk filter manually; consider restricting your browser's access to sensitive material if you're on a shared or unencrypted network.

, Don't neglect plug-in or entire browser updates as they come; doing so will significantly raise your susceptibility to viruses. Instead, update your browser and relevant software as often as you can.

, Cookies are small bits of information your browser saves for the purpose of loading up commonly-used webpages quickly, but they can also be easily intercepted and used to access your email address. Disabling cookies--or simply clearing them often--will minimize this risk.

, While you can't possibly hope to prepare for every feasible virus attack, simply taking a moment to think about suspicious or unprecedented emails and practicing good internet safety etiquette should be more than sufficient., Despite your best efforts, you always run the risk of contracting a computer virus, which means you should have a contingency plan--in this case, an antivirus program. Taking into account your browser and your email provider, whether or not you're willing to pay for a premium antivirus suite, and your operating system, search for exceptional antivirus and anti-malware software.


Generally speaking, AVG, Norton Antivirus, and McAfee are all excellent choices due to their full functionality as free versions--though their paid renditions are more than worth the price tags.

, While antivirus software often comes with a web-related portion, your best protection will come from a dedicated client. Similarly, using one of the aforementioned programs as a predominately offline-based clean-up service will both speed up your computer's processing and increase your protection in the event of an attack.Malwarebytes and Bitdefender Plus both come highly-recommended as anti-malware suites, and both boast free options if you're on a tight budget.Although freeware is attractive, you'll often receive software that is a year or two behind the curve. While this doesn't necessarily render it defunct, it does mean that spending the money for an antivirus suite is worth the cost if you have particularly sensitive or valuable information in your system.

, What better place to have your antivirus software than right in your browser? While online extensions of services such as AVG can prove obtrusive in the long run, the ability to scan links, attachments, and entire websites for malware before you even finish loading a page is an invaluable asset if your computer can handle it.

, You should never download your antivirus software from anywhere but the service's official website. Places like CNET or File Planet that cater to third-party downloads can't necessarily be trusted when downloading antivirus software, since these downloads are the perfect opportunities for viruses to masquerade as benign.


This is another great reason to install a plug-in in your browser: scanning the site from which you intend to download antivirus software is a great way to ensure your computer's safety.

, While you can more or less depend on your antivirus suite to take care of anything that slips through the cracks, you can make life even easier by practicing decent internet etiquette and not clicking on links, emails, or files with which you aren't familiar.

Make sure your computer uses a compatible operating system.,
Have at least 500 MB of storage space available on your hard drive.",How to Activate Spyware Doctor1," Spyware Doctor is supported by the following operating systems.


Windows XP Service Pack 2 (32 bit).
Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (32 bit and 64 bit).
Windows 7 (32 bit and 64 bit).;
, Spyware Doctor requires this disk space to operate successfully.

"
Turn off the infected computer.,
If you have a USB/IEEE1394 external drive enclosure, you may connect the infected drive to that instead of completing the next two steps.

,
Turn off the clean computer.,
Turn on the clean computer.,
Make sure you can see all files.,
Take note of the drive letter of your infected drive.,
Clear your temporary file folders.,
Make sure your recycle bin is empty of all files.

,
Try backing up the drive that is infected to a folder on the clean part of the computer, only if you have enough space for that.,
Perform completely full antivirus and spyware scans of your computer.,
When all the scans for malware are complete, go to ""C:\Program Files"" (on your clean PC's drive) and copy the entire program directories that are for for Spybot, Ad-Aware, and your anti-virus to a new directory on your drive that is infected , called ""F:\Cleaners"".,
Hit a Windows Key+F to bring up the files finding window.,
Look only in the F:\ drive for file names matching ""*.exe"" and which have been modified in the past week.,
Repeat the previous step, but search for file names matching the pattern ""*.dll"" instead ok?.

,
Repeat the previous step, but search for file names matching the pattern ""*.sys"" instead of that.

,
This last step is fairly complicated, but is usually successful at getting rid of most of the most stubborn worms and trojans, they are so despicable .,
Once again, use your best judgment and the methods described earlier for differentiating good from bad.,
If you're using an external hard drive enclosure, use ""Safely Remove Hardware"" to remove it from your PC, turn it off, and remove the (hopefully, by now) cleaned drive.,
Reinstall the cleaned drive in its own case and power on your cleaned PC.,
If your PC boots, you should immediately run the anti-spyware programs in the ""Cleaners"" folder.,
If you're certain that you have removed all malware, you may continue using your Windows install.",How to Remove Spyware Manually (Windows)," Open the case and remove its main hard drive (the one containing the OS partition).;
,, Open the case and connect the infected drive.

, Make absolutely sure that it boots into the clean OS, not from the infected drive! Most PCs have a boot choice menu which can be accessed via the F11 or ESC key soon after power on.

, Once the clean computer's OS has booted, you are going to want to clean out temp files from the infected drive, in order to make it easier to search. But first, you want to see all files, even hidden and system files. Go to ""Control Panel"" -> ""Folder Options"", and click on the ""View"" tab at the top of the ""Folder Options"" window. You are going to want to change the following options:


Turn ON: Put a check in check box to display the contents of System Folders
Turn ON: Select to show hidden files and folders
Turn OFF: Uncheck hide extensions for known file types.
Turn OFF: Uncheck hide protected operating system files (Recommended)

, It's probably going to be E: or F:, depending on the number of hard drives, partitions, and CD/DVD drives you have in your clean computer. Let's assume that we're dealing with the F: drive for this article.

, Once your temporary files folders have been cleared, there are a lot fewer files to search through. This should make the next few steps a bit less tiresome. Some of the following locations may not exist, some may be in slightly different places. It's important that you find and clear the cache for all of your browsers (IE/Netscape/Firefox/Opera) and that you clear it for every single user! Check the following folders and delete their contents, but not the directories themselves.


F:\TEMP
F:\Windows\TEMP or F:\WINNT\Temp (Only NT4 and Windows 2000 use ""WinNT"")
F:\WINNT\Profiles\UserName\Local Settings\Temp
F:\WINNT\Profiles\UserName\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files
F:\WINNT\Profiles\UserName\Local Settings\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\SomeRandomName.default\Cache
F:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Local Settings\Temp
F:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files
F:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Local Settings\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\SomeRandomName.default\Cache

,, If you can back up the whole entire drive,you should . Otherwise, you should be able to get away with just the ""Documents and Settings"" folder (""Profiles"" under NT4) and maybe a few of the folders for your computer games, (some games do store their saved games,their maps , high scores, etc in their program folder).

, This will hopefully find some things on the infected F: drive and remove them.


Download and install both Spybot Search and Destroy and Lavasoft Adaware. It is important that you use both of these utilities, as they will often find more malware together.
Update definition files when prompted.
Scan your machine (this could take a while).
Remove any spyware that is found.
Make sure you have an antivirus program installed and up-to-date. Perform a full scan in your system and remove any viruses, trojans, and worms the program finds.

, Also copy the installers for these programs to the ""F:\Cleaners"" folder. You may need them any time later.

, If you see a little animated dog, you may want to turn him off, because he makes searching a lot more annoying. The search options you will want to use for the searches we will perform are ""Search for All files and folders"" with the following ""Advanced Options"" turned ON:




Search system folders
Search hidden files and folders
Search your subfolders



, Simply enter ""*.exe"" : ""asterisk period exe"", and specify ""within the last week."" You may want to try searching for ""past month"" also , depending upon how long your computer has been infected.


Run the search. Let it run until it completes.
Examine the files that it has found. Some of them you may recognize, especially if you have recently installed certain programs. For example, if you recently upgraded or installed Lavasoft Ad-Aware, you may see""F:\Program Files\Lavasoft\Ad-Aware SE Personal\Ad-Aware.exe"" in these lists. Ignore this type of file. The kind of file you're looking for is usually in F:\Windows\system32, less than 100KB in its size , and has a funny name like ""lkaljya.exe""
Any files you find should be moved into a temporary directory until you can verify that they are legit. For example, you can create a folder ""F:\quarantine"" and move them into a subfolder ""F:\quarantine\Windows\system32"" in there.
Some malicious files are also sneakily hidden in the F:\Windows\system32\drivers directory they will also have funny names like ""lkaljya.sys"".
Any files you find should be moved into a temporary directory until you can verify that they are legit. For example, you can create a folder ""F:\quarantine"" and move them to a subfolder ""F:\quarantine\Windows\system32\drivers"" in there.
If you have an on-access anti-virus program, it may actually start complaining that it found a trojan the second you select the suspect file. If it does, then don't bother quarantining it, just let the antivirus remove it.
Pay particular attention to *.exe files with either random or pretentious names. Pretentious names try to appear important by being very close to actual real useful programs. For example, a useful program is ""svchost.exe"", while a suspect program could be ""scvhost.exe""
Another good way of identifying good products and bad is by right-clicking the executable and clicking ""Properties"", then by choosing the ""Version"" tab (if there is one available). If the file is digitally signed by any company , it will have a ""Company Name"" property on this certain tab, for example ""Microsoft Corporation"" or ""Apple Computer Inc"" or ""Logitech"", etc. These files are probably safe and secure and good. If the file is not signed, then you should investigate further, and more.
When in doubt, go to google and type the full name of the suspect executable: ""scvhost.exe"", for example. Examine the search results. Often you will see links like ""scvhost.exe, good or bad?"" or ""What does this file do?"" and you can see whether or not it is a necessary file or a dangerous trojan.
Pay particular attention to any *.exe files you find in F:\windows\system32 and (especially) anywhere in F:\Documents and Settings. There really shouldn't be many/any executables in the ""Documents and Settings"" folder.

,,, Pay close and lots attention and don't screw up.


Go to Start->Run and type ""regedit"" and press enter.
Load the ""SOFTWARE"" hive from the infected computer and remove any bad ""run on login"" entries.

Select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE by left-clicking it.
Go to the File menu and click on ""Load Hive"".
Navigate to F:\Windows\System32\Config and load the file named ""SOFTWARE"".
It will ask you for a key name. So type ""INFECTED_SOFTWARE"" and press enter.
Click the plus sign on the side of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to reveal the key of ""INFECTED_SOFTWARE"".
Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\INFECTED_SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run.
Back it up!!!!!! Right-click on ""Run"" and choose ""Export Data"" and save this file ""INFECTED_SOFTWARE,RUN.reg"" in the folder of quarantine . Note that if you need to restore this backup thing later on, while the infected computer is still running, you'll have to open the reg file in a text editor and slightly change the key path. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\INFECTED_SOFTWARE would need to be changed to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE, for example. If you merely want to immediately restore this reg file while running on the computer that is clean, you don't have to edit this file; just be 100% sure that the hive is still currently loaded and double-click the reg file so you can re-insert its keys/values into the places that are appropriate.
In the right pane you should see a list of lots of # entries. Some of these may include programs such as Java Update, AOL Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger / Windows Live Messenger, ICQ, Trillian, nVidia / ATI drivers, Sound drivers, Keyboard / Mouse drivers, Antivirus, Firewall software, etc.



, If you determine that something is bad, grab the EXE file pointed to by the key and throw it into the folder for quarantine, and delete the key. You can always restore it later using the registry backup.




Perform the same steps in ""RunOnce"" and ""RunOnceEx"", right next to the ""Run"" key. They may or may not have entries in them.
When you are done, it is important that you click on the ""INFECTED_SOFTWARE"" and then go to the File menu and choose ""Unload Hive"".
Load the ""DEFAULT"" hive from the infected computer (F:\Windows\System32\Config\DEFAULT) and remove any bad ""run on login"" entries. Use the same steps as in the ""SOFTWARE"" step. Note: the ""DEFAULT"" hive may not even have a ""Run"" key. If that's the case, skip it. Be sure to unload ""INFECTED_DEFAULT"" when you're done.
Load each user's hive from the infected drive. You will find the hive at F:\Documents and Settings\UserName\NTUSER.DAT -- load it as ""INFECTED_USERNAME"" and then go through its ""Run/RunOnce/RunOnceEx"" keys for bad entries. You know the drill by now, right? Be sure to unload each hive when you're done.



, Otherwise, you need to power down your clean PC and remove the cleaned drive from the case.

,


If your PC absolutely refuses to boot at this point, you may have no choice but to wipe the drive clean and reinstall Windows. Make sure you have everything backed up and all your reinstall CDs and license keys handy before you do this.

, If there's any spyware left on your PC, it's probably in a weakened state at this point and may succumb now. Also run your currently installed anti-virus program, or try running your anti-virus program from the ""Cleaners"" folder; it may or may not work.

, However, if performance is unacceptable, you may have no choice but to reinstall. Some malware is so persistent that it's less effort to simply start over with a clean slate.

For added security, get an extension for your browser.,

Chrome: go to Tools → Extensions → Get more extensions.






Internet Explorer: go to Tools → Manage add-ons

Help and support, with good customer service
Added security features, aside from just the bells and whistles

Free software:
AdFender
Smart Popup Blocker
Popup Free
Ad Arrest Popup Killer


Paid software:
Super Ad Blocker
Popup Ad Smasher
AdsGone Popup Killer

Decide what type of RAID you want.",How to Configure RAID1," There are a variety of RAID levels, each offering its own type of protection and security.


RAID 0 improves hard drive performance by splitting data over multiple hard drives, but offers no data protection.
RAID 1 writes the same data to multiple hard drives, protecting data against a hard drive failure.
RAID 5 offers improved performance and protection, but requires at least three hard drives.
Research the different types to find the one that best suits your needs.;

Upgrade software and firmware

Upgrade to the latest Dell OpenManage Server Administrator Managed Node package.,
Determine if you have a DRAC4 or DRAC5 card installed.,
Use the omreport command as another method for determining the DRAC version:



Run the command, omreport chassis info |grep DRAC
On a DRAC4 host = DRAC4 Version : 1.60
On a DRAC5 host = DRAC5 Version : 1.32
It is recommended that you use omreport to determine the DRAC version.



",How to Configure Dell Drac Console Redirection for SSH Connections1," Omconfig and racadm should be included in those packages.



 



Upgrade your Drac firmware to the latest version.







Install ipmitool






Set the Dell Drac Password. See setting Dell Drac Passwords
;
,



Two ways to tell your DRAC card version _before_ installing racadm (so you know which racadm to symlink to /usr/bin/racadm ) :
First way is to use the IPMI version. DRAC4's are version 1.5 and DRAC5's are 2.0.
Run the command, /opt/bcs/bin/ipmitool mc info |grep IPMI
On a DRAC4 host= IPMI Version : 1.5
On a DRAC5 host= IPMI Version : 2.0
What's nice about ipmitool is that you don't have to have any OpenManage packages installed to use it. But that's not going to work when they release DRAC6 if DRAC6 is IPMI version 2.0 as well.

Count the frequency of each character in the file to be encoded.,
Store characters as tree nodes and put them into a priority queue.,
Begin to build your tree.,
Finish building your tree: repeat the above step until there is only one node in the queue.,
Create an encoding map.,
In the output file, include the encoding map as a header.,
Encode the file.,
Read in a Huffman-encoded file.,
Read in the binary one digit at a time.,
Repeat until you reach the EOF.",How to Compress Data Using Huffman Encoding," Include a dummy character to mark the end of the file -- this will be important later. For now, call it the EOF (end of file) and mark it as having a frequency of 1.


For example, if you want to encode a text file reading ""ab ab cab,"" you would have 'a' with frequency 3, 'b' with frequency 3, ' ' (space) with frequency 2, 'c' with frequency 1, and EOF with frequency 1.;
, You'll be building a big binary tree with each character as a leaf, so you should store the characters in a format such that they can become nodes of the tree. Place these nodes into a priority queue with each character's frequency as its node's priority.


A binary tree is a data format where each piece of data is a node that can have up to one parent and two children. It's often drawn as a branching tree, hence the name.
A queue is an aptly named data collection where the first thing to go into the queue is also the first thing to come out (like waiting in line). In a priority queue, the data are stored in order of their priority, so that the first thing to come out is the most urgent thing, the thing with the smallest priority, rather than the first thing enqueued.
In the ""ab ab cab"" example, your priority queue would look like this: {'c':1, EOF:1, ' ':2, 'a':3, 'b':3}

, Remove (or dequeue) the two most urgent things from the priority queue. Create a new tree node to be the parent of these two nodes, storing the first node as its left child and the second as its right child. The priority of the new node should be the sum of the priorities of its child. Then enqueue this new node in the priority queue.


The priority queue now looks like this: {' ':2, new node:2, 'a':3, 'b':3}

, Note that in addition to the nodes you created for the characters and their frequencies, you will also be dequeuing, turning into trees, and re-enqueueing parent nodes, nodes that are already themselves trees.


When you're finished, the last node in the queue will be the root of the encoding tree, with all the other nodes branching off from it.
The most frequently used characters will be the leaves closest to the top of the tree, while the rarely used characters will be positioned at the bottom of the tree, farther away from the root.

, Walk through the tree to reach each character. Every time you visit a node's left child, that's a '0'. Every time you visit a node's right child, that's a '1'. When you get to a character, store the character with the sequence of 0s and 1s that it took to get there. This sequence is what the character will be encoded as in the compressed file. Store the characters and their sequences in a map.


For example, start at the root. Visit the root's left child, and then visit that node's left child. Since the node you're at now doesn't have any children, you've reached a character. This is ' '. Since you walked left twice to get here, the encoding for ' ' is ""00"".
For this tree, the map will look like this: {' ':""00"", 'a':""10"", 'b':""11"", 'c':""010"", EOF:""011""}.

, This will allow the file to be decoded.

, For each character in the file to be encoded, write the binary sequence you've stored in the map. Once you've finished encoding the file, make sure to add the EOF to the end.


For the file ""ab ab cab"", the encoded file will look like this: ""1011001011000101011011"".
Files are stored as bytes (8 bits, or 8 binary digits). Because the Huffman Encoding algorithm doesn't use the 8-bit format, encoded files will often not have lengths that are multiples of 8. The remaining digits will be filled in with 0s. In this case, two 0s would be added at the end of the file, which looks like another space. This could be a problem: how would the decoder know when to stop reading? However, because we included an end-of-file character, the decoder will get to this and then stop, ignoring anything else that's been added on after.

, First, read the header, which should be the encoding map. Use this to build a decoding tree in the same way you built the tree you used to encode the file. The two trees should be identical.

, Traverse the tree as you read: if you read in a '0', go to the left child of the node you're at, and if you read in a '1', go to the right child. When you reach a leaf (a node without any children), you've arrived at a character. Write the character into the decoded file.


Because of the way the characters are stored in the tree, the codes for each character have a prefix property, so that no character's binary encoding can ever occur at the start of another character's encoding. The encoding for each character is totally unique. This makes decoding much easier.

, Congratulations! You've decoded the file.

Keep in mind when you are handling the inner parts of any computer or its components make sure the power source is turned off and unplugged.,
Install the RAID adapter in your PC.,
Configure the RAID adapter in your BIOS.,
Partition and format the array.",How to Configure RAID2," Also, make sure you have yourself grounded to prevent damage from static electricity.

Making sure that the computer has been shut off and unplugged will prevent accidental damage to the computer parts as well as accidental injury to the user.
Grounding yourself will prevent accidental shock damage generated by static electricity.
When handling any electrical computer component, don't touch any of the metallic chips or circuitry. The oils on your hands and fingers can and will damage the parts from working correctly.

, Install the adapter in an available PCI or PCI Express slot. You will need to consult the instructions in both your RAID adapter manual and your motherboard manual, as the directions will vary depending on the individual models involved. If your motherboard already came with RAID, then you can just skip this test.


You must set the controller mode to RAID. This is done in the system bios. During the start up of your system, a specific keystroke will bring you to this screen.

, During your PC's boot up sequence, press the key combination to bring up the configuration panel for your RAID adapter. You will find this information in the adapter's manual. Typically, the combination is either Ctrl+R or Ctrl+A.


In some cases, depending on your computer hardware setup, you may be asked to run your computer's CMOS setup program in order to set up your hard drives for RAID.

, Install the adapter in your operating system. During the boot-up sequence of your computer, keep your eyes open for any messages prompting you to install a third-party SCSI or RAID driver. If you see it, then you will need to press F6 to initiate the installation process. In this case, you will be prompted to insert the floppy disk that came with your adapter, as this disk holds all of the third-party drivers.

Decide where you are going to sing or speak.,
Decide if you can live with some sound drop-outs.,
Decide how good the sound quality needs to be.",How to Choose a Wireless Microphone System," Think about how many obstructions will be between you and the receiver. Walls and columns count, but don’t forget that a drum set has enough metal in it to make cheap wireless systems cut out. How far you will be in line-of-sight from the receiver? Most are pretty good these days, but in the off chance you are hoisted a few hundred feet in the air like Gene Simmons, make sure you have the range you need. Don’t count out a wireless mic system if you only play small stages. The smaller the stage, the easier it is to trip on a cable – or multiple cables.;
, There is a chance your signal could drop out. No one wants this, but it happens just like a bad cable happens. If you are playing all ages shows at the local VFW and barely making gas money, maybe you can take a few shortcuts. If you make your living doing a Cher tribute in Vegas and a bad show will lose you your gig and send ripples through the whole circuit, maybe spend a few bucks. There are two things that determine drop-outs – antennae diversity and what band of frequency they are operating in. From worst to first in the drop out rank: Single diversity—this means there is one antenna to get a signal. If it doesn’t get one, it drops out. Two antenna systems are called true diversity and the receiver picks between the two for the stronger signal. True diversity systems have come down in price and are nice option.VHF systems—operate on a bandwidth competing with cabbie's and a thousand radio stations. There are a few bands that don’t even work anymore – the FCC took them away. Anything currently made in this frequency is going to be the lowest-of-low quality. Probably best suited for home karaoke and such. UHF systems—operate on higher frequencies, which are less crowded. Try to find one that has an option to switch channels. If you perform in different cities around the country, you’ll definitely want this option. Every city has different frequencies being used by TV and radio stations. Digital systems – these operate on the 2.4GHz frequency at the top of the UHF band like WiFi, cell phones and related devices. There are no high powered signals on this band – most of these devices operate on one-watt or less – so the chance of interference is low. No system is perfect, but these are your best bet for drop-out free performance.

, All systems have come a long way in sound quality. The quality of sound in wireless microphone systems could be listed exactly like the ranking in drop-outs. In the same way that interference may cause a drop-out, the receiver may not get a clean version of the signal. For true diversity systems, the second antenna helps from having drop-outs, but they don’t really make the signal sound better. Any VHF and UHF system with lots of other frequencies in use could have problems. One high powered wave could disrupt the signal, making the receiver “guess” as to what the signal is supposed to look like. They are designed this way to avoid drop-outs, but the signal really isn’t going to be what the transmitter sent. Digital wireless systems have a slight advantage in this case: they only read “ones” and “zeros”, so they can’t really guess as to the waveform. Any analog versus digital argument wouldn’t apply here. The digital system would have a more accurate version of the original signal. A few digital wireless mic systems have an additional advantage: they don’t use companders. A compander compresses a signal in one direction and expands it in the other. Systems that use them have essentially one more place to lose signal information. As a paper copy of a copy loses something each time, the signal for those may as well.

Gather your equipment (Amp, Subs, Stereo, and wiring).,
Run your amp wires (battery, ground).,
Detach the power cable from the battery and attach your amp's power wire to the power cable for your vehicle; leave it unattached.,
Place the amp where you want it, then attach the ground (black or brown) wire to the amp.,
Now for the RCA jacks, If your using a after market stereo on the back there is 2 RCA jacks, just run the RCA from there to the ""IN"" on your amp and try to avoid running RCA jacks alongside power lines to minimize noise.

,
If you're going to use your stock stereo and run the amp from there you want to buy a Line Out Converter ~$20.,
Now for the Remote (blue wire).,
Use a capacitor to prevent voltage drops caused by deep bass hits, i.e., lights dimming with the beat.,
Run the power wire to your amp.,
Run your sub wires to the amp and screw them in.

,
Turn the gain all the way down, start playing music and turn it up to where you usually listen, where the mids sound good.,
RMS is very important when matching subs and amps, yes not enough power will make subs clip, but also to much power will burn your voice coils by over heating them with too much power .",How to Wire an Amp to a Sub and Head Unit," You can find wiring kits at most stores, ~$40 for 4 gauge wiring and In-line fuse, you won't need anything larger than 4 gauge.


If you're using an after market head unit, go to an electronics store's stereo department and ask for a wiring harness from your car to the after market head unit. Example : If you have a Chevy and a Sony stereo go to them and tell them you need a Chevy to Sony wiring harness, they will ask you the year of the vehicle and then go pick it off the shelf, these are usually by the install department behind the counter. once you have it go unscrew your stock stereo, unplug it, plug in your new wiring harness, and plug in the other end to your Stereo. When you buy the new wiring harness make sure its the same shape/size as your stereo.;
, Figure out where you're going to place the amp, put the beginning of your power (red) wire there and give it about a foot of wire extra, then begin to hide and run the power wire to under the hood. Some vehicles may have existing holes filled with a plastic/rubber insert. Run the power wire through the firewall. If you need to drill a hole in the fire wall, be careful not to hit anything on the other side and be sure the drilled hole will not cut through your power line. Electrical tape at the entry point will give the wire added protection. Make sure this wire is safe from any moving objects.

, If you bought a kit it comes with an inline fuse, if you didn't, you need to get an inline fuse. Just cut the power wire, insert the inline fuse and reattach. The fuse amperage should match the gauge size.

, Ground it to a piece of bare metal (not painted); most people unscrew a bolt from a seat attach the wire and screw it on. Lightly sand the contact area to expose clean metal before attaching ground.

,, With the converter you get a small box with 2 RCA's coming out and 4 speaker wires out the other. You want to take out a door speaker and run 2 of the 4 speaker wires to it, pay attention to the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals. You don't need the other 2 speaker wires, from here secure the Line Out Connector out of sight and run the RCA's to the amp, plug them into the ""IN"" RCA jacks.

, If you're using After market Stereo there will be a blue wire coming from the wire harness in the back, mostly these are attached so you have to splice, just snip them and tape off the old end and run your remote wire to your amp. If you're using your stock head unit you have to purchase a toggle switch that fits your fancy, find a cool place to mount or hide it, from here you want to attach the remote wire to your amp, run it to your toggle, cut it, attach it to one terminal, then attach the end you just cut to another one. Then run the remote wire back to the amp and cut it there leaving a foot or so of extra cable. This will come into play later.

, Get your capacitor as close to the amp as possible, and use the same ground as you did for the amp. Have your power wire taunt and find out where your cap. is going to be, cut the wire, and attach the battery cable to the battery. You cannot just plug it in; you must charge it first with a resistor, use a 1k ohm resistor because they do not get as hot, it only takes a few seconds to charge, do not do this bare handed. You want to ground your cap. and grab a voltmeter and place them on the cap. take the resistor and place it in the power side of the cap. and attach the power wire to the other end of the resistor, your voltmeter should jump up to around 12.0 Volts, then your cap. is charged.

, If you have a stock stereo and you have the remote wire there you want to in twine the remote wire with the power wire before inserting in the power slot for amp. The remote wire tells the amp to turn on. so if you don't have the remote wire from the after market head unit to turn on the amp when ever you turn on the stereo you have to turn your amp on manually. Make sure you always turn off your amp when you leave your car, it will overheat and drain your battery.

,, Tune them gain until the subs sound good.

, Subs and amps should be matched as closely as possible for best performance and longevity.

Identify the 3 terminals on the pot.,
Ground the first terminal of the pot.,
Wire the second terminal to the circuit's output.,
Wire the third terminal to the circuit's input.,
Test the pot to make sure it's wired correctly.,
Position the potentiometer inside the electrical component.",How to Wire a Potentiometer," Position the pot so that the shaft is facing up towards the ceiling and the 3 terminals are facing towards you. With the pot in this position, you can refer to the terminals from left to right as 1, 2, and 3. Make a note of these labels, as it can be easy to lose track of them when repositioning your pot while working.;
, For use as a volume control (by far the most common application), terminal 1 will provide the grounding. To do this, you will need to solder one end of a length of wire to the terminal, and solder the other end to the chassis or frame of the electrical component.


Begin by measuring the length of wire you will need to connect the terminal to a convenient location on the chassis. Use a pair of wire snips to cut the wire to length.
Use a soldering iron to solder the first end of the wire to terminal 1. Solder the other end to the component's chassis. This will ground the pot, allowing it to be turned all the way to zero when the shaft is at the minimum position.

, Terminal 2 is the input of the potentiometer, meaning the output line from the circuit should connect to it. For example, on a guitar, this would be the wire leading away from the pickup. In an integrated amplifier, this would be the wire leading from the pre-amp stage. Solder this connection as before.

, Terminal 3 is the output of the pot, which means it should be wired to the circuit's input. On a guitar, this would mean wiring terminal 3 to the output jack. On an integrated audio amp, this would mean wiring terminal 3 to the speaker terminals. Solder the wire carefully to the terminal.

, Once the pot is wired, you can test it using a voltmeter. Connect the voltmeter's leads to the input and output terminals of the pot and turn the shaft. The reading on the voltmeter should change as the shaft is turned.

, Once the pot is wired and has been tested, you can position it as needed. Replace the cover of the electrical component and place a knob over the shaft of the pot if desired.

Locate the Network Interface Device box on the outside of your house.,
Open the compartment labeled ""customer access."",
Purchase standard residential telephone cable at any hardware store.,
Open the house phone jack you are going to use to connect the new phone line.,
Look at the layout of your home and decide the best way to run the new cable to the outside box.

,
Drill a hole in the outside wall where the cable will be exiting the house through the wall.

,
Push the phone cable back through the walls from the jack to the hole you've just drilled, then pull the cable out through the hole.,
Punch a hole in the thin circle at the bottom of the box lid.,
Strip off 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation covering from each wire.

,
Wrap each wire in a clockwise direction around the post between the washers and the screw, connecting the red wire to the red screw post and the green wire to the green screw post.,
Plug the phone company line back into the jack that you disconnected it from.",How to Wire a Telephone," This is a gray or tan box that measures roughly 8 by 12 inches. The Network Interface Device box is where the telephone wire from the phone company terminates, and also where the phone wiring going into the house will connect to the phone company line.;
, You will notice modular plugs, as well as a pair of screw posts. The plugs look just like the phone jack that you plug your phone into inside of your house. There will be a line plugged into each modular plug for each phone company line that runs to your house. The pair of screw posts will contain one red screw and one green screw. These posts are where your new wiring will connect with the phone company wiring.


Before you begin your wiring project, unplug the phone company line that is plugged into the jack inside the box. This is just a safety precaution, as it will disconnect the power flowing from the phone company line (this is very low voltage, but does increase if the phone rings). You'll need to plug it back in once you've completed the wiring.
The red and green screws correspond to the wire colors that you will be connecting to the box.

, Use only round telephone cable.


Using wire cutters or scissors, gently cut the outer covering of the cable to expose 2 pairs of color-coded, insulated wire. One pair will be red and green (this pair is for line 1), and the other pair will be yellow and black (these wires can be used for line 2 in the future). Expose about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of bare wire.

, A straight-slot screwdriver will work. Wiring inside the jack will now be exposed.


Inside the jack you will find 4 colored wires: red, green, yellow, and black. Each wire is attached to a screw. Using a Phillips screwdriver, loosen each of the screws slightly so that you can pull the attached wire away.
Gently remove about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of covering from each of these wires, just as you did with the cable wires. Splice the cable wires to their matching jack wires by twisting them together. Wrap the spliced bare wires around the appropriate screws, and then tighten the screws.

,,, Run the cable alongside the house to the Network Interface Device box.


Anchor the cable to the outside wall of the house every 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) by using a staple gun that shoots arched staples for phone cable. Or, you can use plastic cable straps secured with a tack hammer. Keep the cable away from anything damp or sharp.

, This thin plastic can be punched through with a pen or pencil.


Pull the wire up through the hole, and run it behind the hinge pin on the left side of the box door to keep it in place. Pull it from behind the hinge so that it can be connected to the red and green screw posts. Loosen the screw posts one full turn.

,, Tighten screws securely over the wire, and reconnect the modular plug into the jack. Close the box cover and tighten down the screw.

, Contact your local phone company and ask them to activate your phone line.

Check with the national and local electrical codes.,
Choose the correct wire size and type for the appliance.,
Locate your outlet less than 200 feet (61.0 m) of the panel box.,
Determine whether to use 3 conductors or 4 conductors.,
Install an outlet even if you can directly connect the appliance to the breaker box.,
Hire a qualified electrician to connect the supply wire to the breaker box.,
Make sure the breaker is turned off.

,
Run the supply wires behind the wall to the outlet location.,
Cut the wires to the correct length for the outlet.,
Strip off about 2 inches (5 cm) of the insulating jacket on the wires.,
Strip off about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of the inner insulation to expose the wire.,
Connect the wires to the outlet.,
Test your connections to make sure they're correct.,
Turn off the breaker, assemble the outlet and install it in the wall.

",How to Wire a 220 Outlet," Make sure you understand all the requirements for wiring a 220-volt outlet.;
, A label should give the amperage rating of the appliance, and this will determine the wire size. An example would be a 20 Amp air conditioner requiring a 12 gauge wire, typically a 3 wire plus ground Romex cable.


Consult the manufacturer's information to discover how much current the appliance will draw. Make sure the wire you use is rated for 20 percent more.
Use copper wire only. If you use aluminum wire, you will need to make sure all of the connections are suitable for aluminum.

, This will prevent a voltage drop that you would have to correct.

, If you are replacing an older appliance, you may have to convert your outlet from 3 to 4 conductors using a pigtail. It's not necessary to rewire the connection and install a new outlet, but you may choose to do so.

, In order to use a direct connection, the appliance must be within 50 feet (15.2 m) and within sight of the breaker box or you must install a disconnect. Since a plug and outlet are a disconnect, you may as well go ahead and install the outlet.

, This is dangerous work that must be done without disconnecting power. If you attempt to do this yourself and make a mistake, you could receive a fatal shock.


Appliances using 220 volts are connected to a double pole circuit breaker, which is two circuit breakers connected together. This allows the appliance to use both phases of the incoming electrical power, and to trip at the same time, removing power to the appliance. If you don't use a double pole breaker, then both breakers may not trip, and the malfunctioning appliance will still have power, which can be dangerous.

,, You will have to cut holes in the drywall, chisel space for the wires in the wall studs and use a fish tape to pull the wire along.


You should have already measured and cut the hole in the drywall for the outlet.

, The wires for a 220-volt outlet are too stiff to allow you to simply stuff any extra into the wall.

, Use a utility knife. Be careful not to cut the inner insulation.

, Use wire strippers to do this.

, Study the outlet and connect the wires to the terminals either by pushing them into the terminals or bending them around a screw and tightening the screw.


Four-conductor outlets have 3 terminals corresponding to the vertical slots on the left, right and top-center, and a terminal corresponding to the rounded bottom slot.
The black wire is ""hot"" and connects to one of the terminals on the left or right. It makes no difference which side you connect the black wire to.
The red wire is also ""hot"" and connects to the other left or right terminal. In 3-conductor connections, there is no red wire.
The white wire is neutral and connects to the top terminal.
The bare wire is ground and connects to the terminal corresponding to the bottom, rounded slot.

, Turn on the breaker and use a voltmeter or multimeter.


The voltage between the left and right terminals should be 220.
The voltage between the left or right terminal and the neutral terminal should be 110.
The voltage between the neutral and ground terminal should be 0.

",How to Wire a Zone Valve," Your boiler's owner's manual may also have instructions for zone valve wiring. Look for any diagrams to help you connect valve wiring in the system's control box.


If you do not have your particular zoning system's instruction manual, try looking for it online through the manufacturer's website.;
, Depending on your system, this may involve flipping an electrical switch or shutting off circuit breakers located ahead and at the boiler.

, This box or panel should be located on a wall near your boiler.

, It may have terminals marked ""T"" in it that go to the boiler to control when to send the boiler's heated water. The control box should also have a transformer of a certain voltage, perhaps 24 volts, to carry power between the thermostat and zone valves.


Zone valve manufacturers often label the connection terminals in their control boxes to make it easier to wire their systems. Use these labels to help you make the appropriate wiring connections.

, Connect the other side of the thermostat to the first terminal of the zone valve operator.

,,, This configuration should wire 3 zone valves.

, The number of zone valves that a control box can handle depends on the model. It may range from 2 or 3 zones to 6.


To wire additional zones, 1 or more extra transformers may be required as well.

, Try matching up wires from labeled terminals in the control box to matching terminals for the transformer(s).

Connect the outputs.",How to Wire a Contactor," Make sure that the contacts of the contactor are rated in both voltage and current to handle the expected load that will be required by the equipment being powered. Contactors are available from building and construction supply stores, as well as some larger hardware stores.;
, The manufacturer information will identify the 2 input pins for 120 volts AC control. The may be 2 or more sets of output contacts identified. These contacts may be indicated on the label as normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC). These contacts also may be shown as a drawing of a line from 1 contact ending in a dot (the NC contact) and another line from another contact that is near the dot, but does not touch the dot (the NO contact.)

, Some contactors provide an auxiliary output contact as a signal to the isolated part of the circuit that the contactor has been energized. This auxiliary contact will not be rated at the higher voltage. Instead, it should be rated at 120 volts AC.

, Remove all power to the wires. Run all input and output wires to the contactor. These wires should be rated in the manufacturer information. Use wire strippers to cut excess length off of the ends of the wire, making sure that the wires are long enough to reach the intended contact. Wire strippers are available at hardware stores and electric supply stores.

, Use the wire strippers to strip a half inch (13 mm) from the ends of each wire. If the wire is stranded, twist the exposed wire to ensure that no strands are left hanging. Stray strands may make unintended contact with a piece of the equipment and cause damage.

, Use a screwdriver to loosen the holding screws in the contact blocks for the wires. Insert the wires only so far that no insulation is pushed into the contact area of the block. Make sure that no stray strands are jutting out from the contact block. Tighten the screws on the contact blocks.

, Apply the control voltage to the input. Listen for the contactor to click as it engages. De-energize the contactor.

, Put the stripped end of each wire into the appropriate contact block after loosening the screw of the block. Make sure that no stray strands of wire are jutting from the contact blocks. Tighten down the screws of the contact blocks.

Patch panels with various numbers of terminations are available. Acquire enough patch connectors on the patch panels to accommodate all of the incoming Ethernet cables. Patch panels are available through electronic supply outlets and some electrical parts stores.
, The map should tell the system administrator which incoming cables are terminated to which patch panel connectors. A map of the patch panel connections is necessary, and labeling the patch panels is helpful in diagnosing system problems and handling future changes and upgrades., Use wire strippers to cut off the cable jacket about 1.5 inches (38 mm) from the end of each cable. Remove and discard the jacket. Wire strippers are available at electrical parts stores and hardware stores., If the incoming Ethernet cables are Cat6 type, they will have an internal plastic jacket under the outer cable jacket that must be carefully removed and discarded using wire cutters. Wire cutters are available at electrical parts stores and hardware stores. If the incoming cable is Cat5e type this step will not be necessary., There will be 4 twisted pairs of wires inside the Ethernet cable. Untwist all of the wires and spread them out. Note that the wires are color coded with 4 being solid colors, and 4 with a white stripe around the color., Place all 8 wires into the 110 style connector of the patch panel in the patch panel outlet that has been chosen to receive that cable. There will be a color code label on the patch panel that indicates which wire is to be placed into which connector pin. Make sure that each wire spans both sets of teeth of the insulation displacement connector., Use a patch panel push tool to firmly press down on each wire so that it is grasped by both sets of teeth of the insulation displacement connector. Patch panel push tools are available at electronic supply outlets and electrical supply stores. If the patch panel push tool has a cutting edge, make sure that the cutting edge is placed over the cut ends of the Ethernet cable so that excess wire will be cut off during the pushing operation. If the patch panel push tool does not have a cutting edge, use wire cutters to remove excess wire from the Ethernet cable that hangs out over the edge of the insulation displacement connector."

You don't have a ground wire.",How to Wire a Double Switch," Head to your circuit breaker and turn off the flow of electricity in the room you are working. Usually the correct circuit is labeled, but if it is not you should turn off all the power in order to be safe.The energy going to a switch is nothing to scoff at, and it can cause serious damage if you come in contact with it.
You should still wear gloves and grounded, rubber soled shoes in order to be safe while working.;
, Touch the device to the old light switch or any exposed wires to ensure that there is no power coming to the wall. Some contractors will lump certain rooms together when wiring, meaning that a nearby bathroom that you thought was turned off could have several wires hooked up to the bedroom fuse.


Simply touch the end of the detector to the light fixture in several places. If the detector light turns on, then power is still running to the switch.Always check and double-check that there is no power coming to you when you work. You can never be too careful when working with electricity.

, Remove both screws and set them aside for later. Pull off the fixture gingerly, removing it from the small switch box embedded in the wall. There should be three or four wires attached to screws on the switch, though they are usually not labeled. You will need to find out which wire is which through some simple tests later on.


The feed is a hot wire, meaning it is always running with electricity. This wire sends electricity to the switch, which then controls whether or not to send electricity to the light, fan, etc. They are often, but not always, red or black, and on the side with a small metal tab, or fin.
There will be two neutral wires connecting to your two appliances, and each one will correspond to a switch on your double-switch when you are done. They are often, but not always, white.
The grounding wire, which is often green, yellow, or bare copper, and is attached to a green screw, helps to protect the switch and your house from an electrical short. Because it was not legally required in all houses for a period of time, some switches may not have grounding wires., If you're not an experienced electrician, take a quick picture of the fixture to determine how the wires are placed. You could also draw a simple diagram. Note each wire and the location it is attached.

, The wires are held in place by screws, often called ""terminals."" The screws are tightened to clamp onto the exposed end of the wire, completing the circuit and powering the switch. To remove the wires, unscrew the screws and pull the wire off of the body of the screw.


If you can keep the wire bent into its current shape it may be easier to attach later.
You should have 3 or 4 exposed wires coming out of the switch box.

, This is likely how two lights or appliances have been run to the same switch. One of the wires, for example, might be for your fan, and the other for the light. These two conjoined wires are wrapped or joined at the terminal, and wrapped around the same screw. They are likely your two feed wires, and will need to be installed on separate terminals later on.

, You're going to need to test the wires now, and if they are touching the metal switch box or the walls you could cause a short. Let the wires dangle out into open air. You're going to have to turn the power on to test which are the feed wires if you're unsure.

, If your wires are not labeled, you'll need to find out which wire is feeding electricity to your switch. Remember, however, that the hot wire is usually black or red, where the neutral wires are usually white. To figure out which is which without colors, turn the power back on at your location. Using a voltage detector, touch the end of each wire. The only one that will light up is the feed wire, because it is currently hot with electricity. Turn off the power before marking this wire.Be extremely careful with these wire while the power is on. Only touch them with your voltage detector and be sure to wear insulated gloves while working.

, There is a metal, rectangular tab on most double switches that indicates which side is for feed wires. This is where you need to connect your appliances. The other side is for the feed wire and gives the switch power.


Frequently, the feed wire terminals (screws) are black or silver.
The neutral side terminals are usually copper.
The green screw is for the grounding wire., You want the wire bent in a clockwise direction. This allows it to turn with the screw as you tighten the screw down. It does not matter which wires you attach first, but it is not a bad idea to start with the ground wire.Only attach one wire to each terminal.
Make sure you remember to attach the grounding wire., You want the wire to fit snugly under the terminal so that has a good, solid connection. Tighten each screw down so that the wires cannot move.

, With both switches in the ""off"" position, turn the power back on and check each switch individually. They should immediately power up the attached appliances.

, Wrap a piece of electrical tape around all the terminals, protecting them from potential shorts.

, With the power still off, place the fixture back on the wall and screw it in with the provided screws. Turn the power back on and celebrate -- you have a new double switch.If this is a new fixture, hold it up against the wall and mark the position of the screws with a pencil on the wall. Using a power drill, make holes where you marked and drill the holes, screwing the light fixture into these holes.

, If you are removing the fixture or unscrewing anything, be safe and cut the power to the area you are working on. Use your voltage detector to make sure that there is no power in the switch before proceeding.


Make sure you check the light bulb and appliance before continuing, as the problem may not be with the switch.

, This will short the connection and prevent electricity from getting to your light.Cover up any exposed wire with electrical tape, or trim it and pull more wire through so that there is no excess wire in the switchbox.

, Most issues are due to a bad or loose connection. Partially unscrew the feed wire and both neutral wires. Make sure they are hooked tightly around the screw before tightening them back down.


Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to clamp the ends of the wire around the screw.
Make sure there is enough wire exposed to make a connection with the terminal. Use a pair of wire strippers to expose at least 1/2-inch of wire.
If the end of the wire is frayed or nicked up, cut it off, strip another inch of insulation off, and use this end., This is common with some older boxes, when you have two single switches hooked up instead of one double switch. A hot wire (red or black) comes out of the wall and into one switch, then out of that switch and into the other one. It may, in some cases, even return to the wall from the second switch. Don't let this discourage you -- simply attach the hot wire on the new fixture exactly how you found it on the old wire. This is why there are often two terminal screws on the feed side.


Some electricians will cut the wire covering in the middle, loop the wire in the terminal, and allow the rest of the wire to continue into the wall. You should do the same thing if you see this is the case in your old switch.

, If checking your connections still doesn't work, you should make sure that the feed wire is in the correct side of the switch. If your switch does not have it labeled, it is the side with the metal tab, or ""fin."" The screws are usually black.


If there are two black terminals on the same side, it does not matter which one you attach the feed to.
If you are still struggling reverse the connections or check the manual included with your new switch.

, Many older houses won't have feed wires, but this is okay. The box is grounded to the house already, meaning you won't need one.

Set your device to measure voltage.,
Choose a range above the max expected voltage.,
Insert the test leads.,
Hold the probes safely.,
Touch the black test lead to one part of the circuit.,
Touch the red test lead to another point on the circuit.,
Raise the range if you get an overload reading.,
Adjust the voltmeter if necessary.,
Read the voltmeter.,
Find a voltage scale on the needle's dial.,
Estimate the needle's position based on nearby numbers.,
Divide your answer if using a different scale.",How to Use a Voltmeter," Most voltage-measuring devices are actually multimeters, which can test several aspects of electrical circuits. If your device has a knob with several settings, set it to one of the following:To test the voltage of an AC circuit, set the knob to V~, ACV, or VAC. Household circuits are almost always Alternating Current.
To test voltage of a DC circuit, choose V–, V---, DCV, or VDC. Batteries and portable electronics are typically Direct Current.;
, Most voltmeters have several options marked for voltage, so you can change your meter's sensitivity to get a good measurement and avoid damaging the device. If your digital device has no range option, it is ""autoranging"" and should detect the correct range itself. Otherwise, follow these guidelines:


Choose a setting higher than the maximum expected voltage. If you have no idea what to expect, choose the highest setting to avoid damaging the device.
Household batteries are usually labeled with the voltage, typically 9V or below.
Car batteries should be at approximately 12.6V when fully charged with the engine off.Household outlets are typically 240 volts in most of the world, and 120 volts in the US and some other countries.mV stands for millivolt (1/1000 V), sometimes used to indicate the lowest setting.

, Your voltmeter should come with one black and one red test leads. Each has a metal probe on one end, and a metal jack on the other that slots into the holes in your voltmeter. Plug in the jacks as follows:The black jack always plugs into the hole labeled ""COM.""
When measuring voltage, plug the red jack into the hole labeled V (among other symbols). If there is no V, choose the hole with the lowest number, or mA.

, Do not touch the metal probes while connecting them to a circuit. If the insulation looks worn or torn, wear electrically insulated gloves or purchase replacement leads.


The two metal probes should never touch each other while they are connected to a circuit, or severe sparking could result.

, Test circuits for voltage by attaching the leads in parallel. In other words, you'll touch the probes to two points an already-closed circuit, with current running through it.


On a battery, touch the black lead to the negative terminal.
In a wall outlet, touch the black lead into the neutral hole, which in the US is the larger vertical hole, or the vertical hole on the left.Whenever possible, let go of the black test lead before moving on. Many black probes have a small plastic bump that can stick into an outlet.

, This will complete the parallel circuit and cause the meter to display the voltage.


On a battery, touch the red lead to the positive terminal.
In a wall outlet, fit the red lead into the ""hot"" hole – in the US, this is the smaller, vertical or the vertical hole on the right., Immediately raise the range to a higher voltage setting if you get one of the following results, before your device is damaged:


Your digital display reads ""OL,"" ""overload,"" or ""1.""Note that ""1V"" is a real reading, and nothing to worry about.
Your analog needle shoots to the other side of the scale.

, You may need to make adjustments if a digital voltmeter display reads 0V or nothing at all, or if an analog voltmeter's needle has barely moved. If there is still no reading, try the following in order:


Make sure the test probes are both connected to the circuit.
If you are measuring a DC circuit and get no result, look for a small knob or switch on your device labeled DC+ and DC- and move it to the other position.If your device does not have this option, reverse the positions of the black and red probes.
Reduce the range by one setting. Repeat if necessary until you get a real reading.

, A digital voltmeter will clearly display the voltage on its electronic screen. An analog voltmeter is a little more complicated, but not too tough once you learn the ropes. Continue reading for instructions.

, Choose one that matches the setting you chose on your voltmeter's knob. If there is no exact match, read from a scale that's an easy multiple of the setting.


For example, if your voltmeter is set to DC 10V, look for a DC scale with a max reading of 10. If this isn't available, find one with a max of 50.

, This is a linear scale just like a ruler.


For instance, a needle pointing halfway between 30 and 40 indicates a reading of 35V.

, Skip this step if you are reading from a scale that exactly matches your voltmeter's setting. Otherwise, correct for the difference by dividing the printed scale's max value by your knob setting. Divide the number the needle points to by your answer to get the actual voltage.


For example, if your voltmeter is set to 10V but you are reading off a 50V scale, calculate 50 ÷ 10 = 5. If the needle is pointing at 35V, your actual result is 35 ÷ 5 = 7V.

1) You need to learn to use two network tools: ping and tracert (traceroute in linux).,
In Windows, to use command line, you need to go to Start - run (0r cmd).,
You will receive some information of this sort: ""64 bytes from maa03s17-in-f7.1e100.net (74.125.236.199): icmp_req=1 ttl=48 time=329 ms""

,
Now: pay attention, - this is the tool you will use to your advantage.

,
2) The second tool needed is ""tracert"" in Windows or ""traceroute"" in Linux.,
This time you will receive a bit more information.,
Practice a bit on some innocent addresses, both ping and traceroute.

,3) The detective work.,
Take the address that gives you a certain trouble regarding your downloads.,
Now, start your download (or start watching video and such).,
Note down the addresses of these offending nodes, for example:""0.ge-1-3-0.XT2.NYC9.ALTER.NET"" - the whole thing, this is important.

,4) The repair stage.,
Sometimes you can start doing this WHILE the download is happening.,
Open the command line tool, and use the ""ping"" command.,
NOW, WHILE DOING THIS - start your download or stream and such.

",How to Get Around Unfair Download Restrictions," While there are some rather simple click and click programs using this tools, the simplest way is to use command line, both in Windows and in Linux. In linux you need to open a terminal (console) window.;
, First try a few sites, for example ""ping google.com"". You may use www., or not.

,,, Again open the command line (Start - run or cmd, or terminal in Linux) and type: ""tracert google.com"" in Windows or ""traceroute google.com"" in Linux.

, You will see the addresses of the nodes through which your signal is traveling, and the TIMES it spends at each one of them.

,,, First ""tracer(ou)t(e)"" it on its' own. Let's say ""tracert ftp://myftpthingy.net"". Note down (or save to a text file) your results. You will be able to see about 10-30 nodes through which your connection travels. The times spent at any one of them will be much less then a second (1 millisecond is 1 thousandth of the second). Normally from about 30ms to may be 200ms. There are some different possible numbers here, do not worry much.

, WHILE DOING THIS - ""tracer(ou)t(e)"" the address again. If you are experiencing speed or connection problems - you will see some very different numbers of the milliseconds for the same nodes. Some of this numbers will run into few seconds. Some nodes will pretend to be stupid and keep on asking ""what's that my dear?"", -you will see a few ***.**ms values next to them. Very often after this nodes - the connection breaks.

,,, More often then not, you will have to reset the connection, - close the browser, open again.

, As the address use the address of the node that increased request time many fold, or kept on issuing reset requests. For example: ""ping P15-3.CLPPVA-LCR-02.verizon-gni.net"".

Switch off the main power switch.,
Take the cover of the breaker box off.

,
Use an electrical tester by putting the tip of one probe against the ground bus bar and the other against one of the screws of a circuit breaker.,
Remove the covering from one of the holes that runs across the breaker panel's top side.,
Attach a cable clamp through the hole.,
Run a four-conductor cable from the sub-panel breaker box through this clamp and tighten it.,
Cut the covering of the cable and pull this covering away.,
Find the ground bus bar.,
Find the neutral bus bar.,
Locate an opening for a new circuit breaker.,
Locate the black hot wire and attach it to the back of the circuit breaker.,
Locate the two sets of clips on the back side of the circuit breaker.,
With the circuit breaker held correctly (the text on it should indicate which way is right side up), push the set of clips at the right side of its back into the plastic bar in the opening.

,
Check once more to make sure the circuit breaker is switched off.

,
Push the left set of clips at the back of the circuit breaker into place on the plastic bar in the opening.

,
Get in touch with a professional electrician to test out your work on the circuit breaker before turning power back on.

",How to Wire a Breaker Circuit," This should be located at the top of the breaker panel.;
,,


Connected to this screw should be a red, black, or blue covered wire.
If you have properly turned off the power, there should be no signs of voltage.

, You may need a small, pointy tool, such as a screwdriver, to get them out.

, The cable clamp will keep the four-conductor cable in place after you run it through the hole.


Remove the lock-nut from the cable clamp.
Push the cable clamp through the hole. The side that comes through the bottom should have spiral edges for screwing it in.
Tighten the lock-nut back around the cable clamp by placing it at the underside of the clamp where you see the spiral edges and screwing it in with Channel-Lock pliers.

, You may need a professional to look at your breaker box and tell you which kind of four-conductor cable you need.

, Inside the covering, you'll find a copper wire (the ground wire), a white covered wire (the neutral wire), a black wire (the hot wire), and a red wire (another hot wire). In the sub-panel box, the neutral and ground wires will connect the same as they do in the main breaker box, but the red and black wires will connect to the hot bar instead of a circuit breaker.

, It is a metal strip with a row of screws running down it. Using a flathead screwdriver, unscrew one of them slightly and push your ground wire through. Screw it back in tightly after you insert it.

, Like the ground bus bar, this will be a metal strip with a row of screws, but the neutral bus bar is typically white.


Take a neutral wire and cut away about a centimeter of the covering at the end of the wire.
Use your flathead screwdriver to unscrew one of the screws and then push the wire through.
Screw it back in after you have inserted the neutral wire.

,


You should find a list of acceptable circuit breakers you can use.
Make sure that your circuit breaker is of acceptable size and voltage.

, It will be clearly indicated where this should go. Depending on the kind of circuit breaker you must use, you may have to attach the red hot wire as well.

, One set will be on the left side, and the other on the right side.

Double click Connect and you’ll now be asked to type in your name, e-mail, a nickname and an alternative nickname.Note: If you feel you are willing enough to put your real information then do so but many for security reasons, don’t.,
After having double clicked Connect, you were presented with 5 sub-categories.,
Default settings for Servers, Options, and Firewall are just fine but you can choose to go through them after this tutorial.,
To move on, go to Identd and check where it says “Enable Identd server?.,
Look back at the regular categories again and double click DCC.,
Now select the sub-category “Folders�?,
Click on Ignore now under Folders and make sure you select Disabled under Method.,
Now go to Fserve and check everything except “Perform DNS lookup.?,

, In this section, you’ll see “On Send Request? and “On Chat Request?. The settings for this section are more of a personal preference. For those that wish to request a download and let it download on it’s own you’ll change “On Send Request? to Auto-get file, “If file exists? to Resume. For those that wish to request a download and wait on it, you’ll select “Show get dialog?. It’s recommended that you leave the “On Chat Request? on Show chat dialog because IRC is filled with many spammer and this may cause your IRC client to be filled with extra windows filled with spamming messages from those uses.Note: Leaving Auto-get file on can be very risky depending on what room you’re in. Certain rooms may have users that’ll attempt to send other users viruses but most room Admins will usually kick those users out.

, and under Type select default.


Once you’ve selected default, click on edit and under “Into this folder�? change it to the location where you want your downloads to go.







, On the bottom, uncheck “Turn ignore back on in.?

Proofread.",How to Write a Wikipedia Article," Go to Wikipedia's Main Page or, if you want to write your article in a language other than English, visit the international page and click on your language.;
, First, you'll need to do a search to see if the article already exists - if yours is a popular or well-known subject, the chances are it already exists. In the box, type in your article topic. (e.g. ""zero gravity marriage"") and press Enter.

, If an article about your subject already exists, the article will come up now; if no such article exists, you will get a list of search results. Check this list - it may be that your article is written under a slightly different heading. If you are sent to an article that isn't the one you just typed in, check the top of the page. It may be that your search term was a redirect to another article, which means you can create it as a stand-alone article.

, If no article exists and you wish to create an article, first ask yourself the following questions:


Is it a worthwhile subject for an encyclopedia article?
Is it notable (will anyone else ever bother to read this)?
Is it verifiable (are there other references to it elsewhere on the internet, or in books)?
If the answer is 'no' to any of these, do not create the article. Articles that aren't notable or verifiable are deleted, and all your hard work along with it.

, If a 'Create this article' link is visible on the search page, click that. If not, look under where it says 'Search' - it'll say (e.g) ""You searched for Underwater tennis"" Click on the link of the title you typed in - i.e. click on underwater tennis. Then click on ""Start the Underwater tennis article""

, You can edit Wikipedia articles without having an account, but to create an article from scratch, you need an account. Click on ""Log in or create an account"". If you have an account, then log in now. If not, click on ""Create one"". Type yourself a username and password (twice), and click ""Create account"". Assuming no-one else has taken your name already, your account should be created successfully, and you can now create your article. Anonymous users can also submit an article through the Articles for creation system, but it won't appear as an article until a registered user approves it.

, The space for writing the article before you publish it is your userpage. Go to User:(your username here)/(your article name here), where you can edit. Click on the 'create' tab.

, You should now have a big empty box in which you should write your article. Write a short introduction (called a 'lead' section), and then the main body of your article. Make it a reasonable length, and informative (see Tips and Wiki formatting, below). When you have finished, click the 'save button'.

, Your article has not been published yet!! Have a good read, looking out for spelling or grammatical errors. If you are happy with it, click the 'move' tab. Remove the 'User:(your username here)/' bit so only the article name remains. Now you have a new article! Consider nominating it for Did you know. You can do this by typing WP:DYK in your search box and following the instructions located there.

Have a good idea, going in, as to how involved you want your work wiki to be.,
Get others on board.,
Search around for a suitable wiki package.,
Start out simple.,
Start documenting your work.,
Be accessible.,
Allow the wiki to unfurl slowly.",How to Wiki Your Work," Yes, things change, but at least give its initial layout and purpose some thought. In particular, consider your intended purpose for this wiki. For example:


Do you simply like the link format to create a semi-structured set of notes for yourself, or do you hope to collaborate with team members or coworkers?
How widely do you want to spread your wiki? Do you want it just for yourself (such as to keep track of your career portfolio) or for your whole office?
How big would you like the wiki to become? Or, do you want to leave this to its own organic growth?;
, If you're doing this for teamwork, make sure the boss or supervisor is in-the-know and is happy about it. You may need to spend time showing this person how to use the wiki, along with explaining its benefits for the workplace.

It can also be a good idea to explore the level of interest from coworkers. Some may be familiar with wikis and have some great ideas for its development.

, There are free wikis, ones you pay for, portable wikis,etc. Select a wiki according to your budget, space availability and ease of use. You may also have to take into account any security issues related to your workplace; talk to your IT people for more advice.


If the idea has just occurred to you, but you are unfamiliar with the concept of how wikis operate, look around for a wiki to work on for a while. Find something that fits your interests; this site is a great place to give it a go.

, Although it may seem difficult to get started, you will find that your ideas and plans will feed on themselves and grow. Just start adding bits and pieces to begin with and work from there; perhaps leave a bunch of notes or upcoming presentation bullet points and then work on it over a few days. Add links, open new pages, make corrections and watch the project unfold.

, Different things work for different people and there are many ways to make a wiki work hard for you. Whatever helps you to think better, get inspired and work through problems is the best approach, there is no one single ""right"" way. Some examples include:


Create a flowchart of your job;
Create a career log;

Take notes in a notebook style wiki, or just type as you think; use it as a hyperlinked notepad utility;
Write articles or short pieces to summarize work issues;
Create templates for project management or time management;
Add some spreadsheets for data management;
Encourage team participation by leaving questions, suggestions, big blank areas that are begging to be filled in by those with the knowledge... And so forth.

, If you're using a wiki in a shared environment at work, and you're the wiki guru, be available for others. Wikis offer a powerful way to share information and collaborate. Be prepared to explain to others what the wiki is for and how to use it. Help answer their questions, guide their learning and encourage their experimentation. It's important to let them know that they don't need your permission, or any other person's permission either; they just need to dig in and help to evolve the wiki as they see fit.


It's important to explain that wikis allow for others to make changes to pre-existing work but that this is all aimed at the betterment of what is being created. Also make it clear that everyone can check the history to see what changes have been made and to make comparisons.
Ensure that there are rules about behaving cooperatively and supportively on the wiki. This will come naturally to most but it's better to be safe than sorry and to have rules in place to prevent edit warring, arguments and snarky commentary.

, Growing a wiki takes time and a better, stronger wiki is one that is tended regularly but not pushed aggressively. Don't expect everything to happen in a day. It won't. Wikis grow as you and others add things to them, so simply start adding.


Bear in mind what the intended outcome is for the wiki. Is it to remain ongoing? Is it just meant for a one-off project? Is it meant to inform future users? Try to direct things to meet your objective.
Have someone check updates to ensure that they are appropriate and in keeping with the purpose of the wiki.

Post your hobbies and interests when you first join, if there is a meet and greet forum.,
Always be polite to everyone.,
Be helpful.,
Avoid huge forum wars.,
Make each post well thought and have a clear meaning.,
Use impeccable spelling.,
Don't make unneeded replies.,
Limit your use of internet slang.,
Respond to private messages quickly.,
Do not boast.,
Do not threaten people who anger you.,
Learn advanced syntax for posts if your forum supports it.,
Read the TOS (Terms of Service) for the forum.,
Do not abuse the signature feature some forums allow.,

If the forum is a DYI site, or has a ""Guides"" section, contribute to this by making guides.,
Apologize when you lose your temper or make a mistake.,
Learn your forum's focus.,
Contribute to conversations, don't just agree with everyone.

,
Do not constantly complain about your life.",How to Use Large Forums," If the forum in question has an Introduction sub-forum, introduce yourself, include your hobbies and interests in the post.;
, Being polite is not only for the admins or popular users of the forum, it includes everyone. If you appear to be a polite person, people will think of you as mature and kind.

, Work hard to help people solve problems, if that's what the forum is for. People really appreciate it when someone goes out of their way to help them, and will remember it for a long time.

, Do not become involved in huge wars. When a bunch of users are arguing about, for example, the best Linux distro, and the debate has gone past being rational and is at the point where everyone is just attacking each others comments, do not take sides. You will likely lose the respect of the users on the side you didn't take.

, Don't make posts that are vague and have no real point to them.

, People who frequently make posts riddled with spelling mistakes will be viewed as juvenile by other members of the forum.

, Slang makes more sense with live chatting, such as IRC or Windows Live Messenger. When posting in forums, people don't expect you to respond instantly, so there is not point in posting ""brb"" (Be right back) when you need a bathroom break. Just go and come back and no one will realize you left.

, Its fine to have the occasional ""LOL"" or ""OMG"", but making posts that are comprised largely of acronyms will make you look juvenile.

, When a user takes the time to talk to you specifically, don't let them down, respond right away, especially if you told them to PM you.

, People universally dislike a show-off, on the internet or off. People will be more impressed of your achievements if you are modest about them.

, Not only will people laugh at you, but you will lose the respect of the person you threatened, and likely others as well.

, You can make your posts look more professional if you can use the styling syntax your forum supports. An example of this is the ""code"" tag some forums support. It usually is used to surround text that is a computer programming language (i.e Flash or C++) in a box and give it a separate font and color than ordinary text. Some forums simply allow posts to be made in HTML to allow full customization of posts, but many turn this feature off due to abuse.


Do not however, abuse the BBCode/HTML post features to draw attention to your posts. An example of an annoying habit that is unfortunately common is users constantly coloring their entire posts a different color than the forum's template, just to seek attention.

, Some forums have out of the ordinary rules, or are stricter in certain areas than others. It's best to know what kind of posts are considered annoying or inappropriate to prevent your account from being banned in the even you make an unknowing mistake.

, Some forums allow the user to set a 'signature' in the control panel. The user can enter some text and sometimes pictures that will appear beneath every post they make. Forums that do allow this feature usually have limitations on its use, the most common being:


No ridiculously large images.
Some forums do not allow links in the signature.
Nothing should be put in the signature that wouldn't be allowed in a standard forum post.
If the forum has HTML enabled for posts, do not insert text and use HTML tags to make it huge or in an annoying color.

, This will make you appear petty and mean.

, If you make a few useful tutorials, you will gain many peoples respect and notice.

, A person who can recognize their mistakes and apologize for them is infinitely more deserving of respect than someone who holds a grudge.

, If the forum is centered around a single topic or group of topics, know them well.

,, Despite how interesting it may seem to you, most people will likely bore of hearing how much your boss sucks, or how annoying your ex is.

Read the message board rules thoroughly.,
Get to know your fellow couponers.,
Learn the message board lingo.,
Connect with others about deals.,
Leave feedback and ratings on your trade.,
Save all private messages.",How to Trade Coupons and Deals on a Message Board," Each message board is different from another, so don't assume that you can magically start trading automatically even if you know couponing basics. Some boards may have posting minimum requirements before a person can start trading, limitations until a person has a certain amount of trading ratings, etc.;
, Aside from trading, the entire point of these message boards is to get and share knowledge with others about scoring great deals. By interaction, everyone can gain trust and knowledge about others and their budgeting lifestyles.

, Besides the general couponing lingo, there are abbreviations and phrases applied to coupon trading.


CC: ""Concealed Cash"" - Actual money in an envelope; always ""concealed"" by a card or folded paper from prying eyes in the mailing process.
Envie: ""Envelope""
FSOT: ""For Sale or Trade"" - The deals that a person is willing to sell or trade with others.
GC: ""Gift Card"" - Many people will trade gift cards for a cash value, coupons, or other deals.
H: ""Have"" - This is what a person has in their possession.
ISO: ""In Search Of"" - This is what a person is search of for their needs.
IVSO: ""In Very Search Of"" - This is what a person really needs as soon as possible.
Potluck - This is an envelope with a mixture of coupons. It can be either a specific category (Baby, Food, Pet, etc) or the seller will offer a list of the available coupons they have for the trader/buyer to select from.
PP: ""PayPal"" - To avoid additional costs, most people request a PayPal gift. To their discretion, they might add in the shipping costs in their deals.
RAOK: ""Random Acts of Kindness"" - By performing this, you are giving away coupons and deals without wanting anything in return.
W: ""Want"" - This is what a person wants in a trade.

, If you see someone offering a sale or trade with something you need or want, work things out in private messages.


Make sure that both of you agree and confirm to the trade.
Trade mailing addresses and/or PayPal email addresses after it's been confirmed.
Mail any envelopes as soon as you can, preferably the next morning. If there are any delays, always notify the other trader so that they can estimate on when their trade would arrive.
If you are new or do not have trading experience on that particular forum, you may be required to send/mail your trade first. This is on a trust factor in trading. There are lots of times where two people make a deal, but one party does not hold up to their end. This results in trust and savings loss.

, Be very honest when doing so. If you received your envelope/trade in a timely manner, always leave positive feedback through their profile. Please know that majority of the trades are mailed are sent on a first class post office schedule, so it might take anywhere between 3 to 7 business days, depending on the distance between the traders. If you have not received your trade in 1 1/2 to 2 weeks, private message the other person to inquire about the trade. If there's no response, you may private message the moderators of the message board. Never leave negative feedback if you received something that you agreed on, but decided you didn't want.

, When a trade is official between two parties, the messages can be treated as proof for any trading concerns/disputes. It is also useful for future trades when you have someone's mailing address.

Get the Mozilla Firefox browser.,
Register for a forum based on a topic that interests you.,
Spend time learning the forum's platform (the software that runs it), if you don't already know it.,
Lurk.,
Find the tracker.,
Set up your bookmarks.,
Join the community.",How to Stay on Top of Internet Forums with Firefox1," If you are unable to install new software, try Mozilla Firefox, Portable Edition. It works just as well, and if you put it on a flash drive, you can use it on any PC. Firefox isn't just more up-to-date than Internet Explorer; it's completely extensible with extensions that will allow you to customize your browser to your personal needs.;
, It can be any size, but a larger, more active forum will be more difficult to stay on top of.

, Invision, vBulletin, phpBB, and other less popular forum platforms all do the same thing, but they all have their quirks. Learning the platform will mean you can work more efficiently.

, Try to learn who the big movers and shakers are. Learn the names of the active administrators and moderators are.

, The tracker is the most important part of the forum. It lists the most recent activity on the forum. Your ability to stay on top of a forum relies almost entirely on mastering the tracker. Not all forums have a tracker or call it something else. As a last resort, set up a search which displays the last 100 posts made on the forum.

, On the Firefox Bookmarks Toolbar (under the Address Bar) right-click, and choose New Folder. Type in the name of the forum or a good abbreviation. To bookmark a page, click on its favicon to the left of the address bar (a blank sheet of paper, but more commonly an icon of some sort) and drag it to your folder. If you don't like the name of the bookmark, right click it and choose Properties, and change it. Bookmark the tracker, the forum index (the list of all sub-forms) and any favorite sub-forums you want one-click access to.

, This is not the same as registering. To join a community, either introduce yourself and talk to those who greet you, or dive into the general/off-topic area and chat. Alternately, helping somebody with a problem they're having goes a long way towards establishing your credibility.


Now you're well on your way to becoming a full-fledged member of the community. Depending on the community, this could be automatic, or you might need to satisfy a time or activity requirement, such as 25 posts or 2-3 days. Understand that staying on top of a forum means that you know just about everything, if not everything that happens on that forum. Think of the forum as a ball. You're at the bottom, knowing nothing. You want to be on the top. Either read everything, or, to be more realistic, ""cheat"" and use the ""mark all read"" feature to mark the entire forum as read. You are now on top of the forum, even though you don't know everything that's gone on. Now the trick is staying there.

Expect surprising insights.,
Double check.",How to Choose Between Wikipedia or Classic Encyclopedias," Older encyclopedias will not have information about new trends, topics, current events, and people. You're not likely to find AJAX in your library resources. However older topics, like Shakespeare, are likely to exist in both places.;
, For some papers, research just provides background information where 100% accuracy is not critical. Other topics require precision and quoting, something a hard encyclopedia is better to offer. Wikipedia offers more updated information, but the validity is only as good as the source. Online collaboratives are run by users, some are experts, some are not.

, A major encyclopedia, like Britannica, can have articles written by highly intelligent experts who might describe astounding insights in their articles. However, even the street-level Wikipedia sometimes contains articles by intelligent experts or eyewitnesses, who avoided the committee censorship, and wrote profound insights within a Wikipedia article. Also, profound information might still exist in prior Wikipedia revisions: check the ""Talk"" discussion of an article to see if expert opinions were removed but still exist in prior revisions that can be viewed.

, Why not use both, each will offer information to compare and contrast... sounds like a topic for a totally different paper in itself.

It's important to understand that there's a distinction between blocking and banning in Wikipedia. Banning usually occurs by community consensus or Arbitration Committee decision. If you were banned in this manner, understand that your appeal will likely not even be considered unless it's been a long period of time after your ban initially started. Typically, for an unban request to have any sort of chance to succeed, you must wait at least a year or two before submitting a request.;
, Take your block as a chance for you to become more acquainted with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines so that you can move on from the block and become a well-respected user. Focus specifically on the policy that you were against so that you don't make the same mistake again.

, This page explains how the appeal process works and how you can make an appeal.

,

, Replace the ""Insert your reason to be blocked here"" with the reason you want to be unblocked. A good unblock reason will:


Show that you understand why you were blocked and your understanding of the policy you were against. Address the reason for your block in your reasoning.
Admit that you did something wrong and that it won't happen again.
Show that the block is not necessary to stop you from causing further problems on the site.
Show that what you were blocked for is not your normal behavior. This will show that you can be trusted.
Give links as evidence.

,,, It can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days for a review to happen. If your appeal is accepted, you'll be unblocked and able to edit again. If it's declined, on the other hand, you'll remain blocked, and the reviewing administrator will explain why he/she declined your appeal. Should your appeal be declined, go through the steps again to make another appeal, this time taking the declining administrator's comments in mind.

",How to Post a Screenshot in the Forums," You can take screenshots using software that's already on your computer, or you can download a program (some are free, some aren't).

In Windows, hold down the Alt key and then press the Print Screen key. Open Microsoft Paint (Start > All Programs > Accessories > Paint). Press and hold ""Ctrl"" and tap V. This will put your screenshot in MS Paint. Save it.

The parser function if displays results depending on whether what you put for y is blank, or contains character(s).,
ifeq displays results depending on whether or not y and z are the same things.,
switch is basically a more extended and versatile version of the parser function #ifeq.,
expr basically does math expressions.",How to Use Parser Functions in MediaWiki2," While you can put anything instead of a parameter, it won't have much use.


Replace y with what parameter you want to check.
Replace z with what you want to appear if y is supplied.
Replace a with what you want to appear if y isn't supplied.;
, As with #if:, this parser function is most helpful when used with parameters rather than plain text.


Replace y and z with what strings/parameters you want to compare.
Replace a with what you want to appear if y and z are the same.
Replace b with what you want to appear if y and z aren't the same.

For example, ""Buddhist Republican Forum"" will probably work better than ""Religion & Politics Forum."";
, If you get some webspace and a good bit of experience with web development, you can set up your own message board using a software package. Or many hosting providers now have automated tools to install forums for you. If you are unable to set up your own hosting, you can use one of the remotely hosted forum services such as EZboard (now Yuku), or Proboards which offer forums on sub-domains (with the forum hosts name in your address), but many prefer to have a forum at their own domain (example.com), which many hosts now provide. Make sure to get a good host because you don't want downtime. Get good community software so that you can satisfy all of your communities wants and needs.

, Ideally, you want 5-10 separate forums, each dealing with some aspect of your community topic. For example, you can have a ""General Discussion"" forum, a ""Science"" forum, a ""Political Discussion"" forum, etc. Try not to over-categorize. Ask yourself if each subforum you add will make your community better by facilitating new topics or if it will detract by spreading content too thin and forcing the users to search for content they are looking for.

, If you have some online friends with similar interests, send them a quick e-mail to let them know about your ""grand opening."" If you have a website, announce your new community to your visitors. Whatever you do, avoid ""spamming"" (advertising to strangers without permission). Spamming will ruin the reputation of your community before it has a chance to get started. You can also add your community info on your profile as signature. When you post, people will see.

, Each separate discussion forum within your community should have its own moderator. The moderator keeps the discussions fresh by starting new topics and removing inappropriate content. Community users who are knowledgeable about the subject matter of the forum and willing to spend a few minutes a day helping the community grow will make good moderators.

, You and the team of moderators should agree on some basic rules of conduct (such as ""no personal attacks""), and enforce them. Occasionally, you may need to ban a disruptive user from your community in order to prevent problems.

, Exchange links with other communities with similar interests in order to grow your user base. As your community increases in size and activity, you will have more opportunities to create strategic partnerships with other websites.

, You need to foster a sense of loyalty and ""belonging"" among your membership, or they will eventually go somewhere else. Games, contests, custom titles for users, and other ""gimmicks"" work well, but simple friendliness and respect are even better.

, How will people know you if you make no posts at all? Be sure that the posts you make are smart and considerate of other people though. You won't be appreciated for loading the forum with your personal wishes and attitude all the time.

, Some forums contain threads that permit games and this can be a way of stimulating interest and interaction. Play games such as ban the person above you (not really, for example: I ban you for having no signature!), vending machine and count to 100.

, People like jokes, so why not always post them? Just don't make them at anyone else's expense though as that's a bore.

, Unless you want to inflame the forum and make yourself more unpopular steer clear of topics that can cause people to become overheated, bossy, pushy and single-minded. Arguing on forums is a total bore and is something that won't ever be resolved when it's on touchy subjects. Unless, of course, the forum is about those very topics anyway!

Evaluate your behavior.,
Refrain from making an overload of posts or sending a lot of messages.,
Watch your spelling and grammar.,
Tell your enemies how you feel.,
Show your fellow users what you're capable of.,
Assume good faith (don't jump to conclusions) about people who may insult you.",How to Cope With Being Thought Of as Irritating Online," Do you just happen to act annoying, or do you happen to actually be mean to other people? There's a difference between being irritating - simply being not cool - and being an irritating jerk - where somebody's mean-spirited and rude attitude is considered irritating. Learn the difference between the two concepts, for example:


The lovable Steve Urkel from ""Family Matters"" would be considered simply irritating;
While the arrogant Nermal from the ""Garfield"" comics would be classified as an irritating jerk.;
, Your irritating behavior could possibly be the result of looking like you're trying too hard to fit in - and posting less could make it seem like you're not trying so hard -- however, even if over-posting isn't actually the problem, laying off the posting a little or even taking a break all together could still cause other people's opinions of you to lighten up over time.

, It's good to speak with proper capitalization and spelling, but also watch your grammar. Evaluate how you speak. Do you tend to speak with grammar that, while not necessarily improper, may be awkward?

, In a calm and controlled manner, let them know that you feel that they're hurting your feelings and carefully attempt to set things straight. Try discussing your feelings over in a chat room or by sending them a private message or e-mail.

, Do you have a talent? Work on developing it, then show other people your work and make them realize that they're underestimating you (while preferably making an attempt not to pass off as egotistical in doing so). For example, are you a good artist? If your forum or chat room has a thread/section for people to post their art, then post it there. Are you a good composer? Show them your music.

, Maybe they mistakenly think that you're trying to be annoying on purpose, or trying to troll people.

If you have been banned from a forum in the past, be careful about posting about it.",How to Behave On an Internet Forum," That way, you will know what is allowed and what is not.;
, If you know the rules of a place, you can avoid some trouble with the moderators in the long-term. If you're finding it difficult to understand the rules, ask a Staff Member (typically those who have a rank that includes the word ""Administrator"" or ""Moderator"" in their rank). Forums almost always come with a means of Private Communication - usually called ""Private Messaging"" or ""PM"".

, Consider that people have feelings, and that what you say to somebody can hurt that person. You should also be willing to lend a helping hand to anybody who needs help. If the forum you browse on has a welcome section, then be sure to welcome new users and guide them around the site as necessary.

, Usually, it's not like that person is hurting anybody on purpose. Somebody speaks like a 12-year-old? Makes a lot of useless threads? Don't give them grief for it. It's not like they wronged you. You should especially not cyberbully an irritating member - not only is it plain hurtful, but please consider that it is becoming illegal to cyberbully in increasingly more states., Don't jump to conclusions; this is important to avoid unnecessary flame wars. Sometimes, people may accidentally say something in a more snarky fashion then they actually meant, or they may have misinterpreted something somebody else said and retaliated back.

, Seeing some drama at an Internet forum you go on may seem fun, but it leads to hurt feelings. Chances are, you'll also get banned, so it probably wouldn't be worth it anyway. If there's a drama event going on at a forum, don't join in. Make your efforts to defuse the drama instead.

, One source of regret on a forum is not making a post and speaking up in a situation when necessary. First, consider if what you feel the need to say will actually set things straight rather than just hurting them.Use calm confrontation as a first resort. Be sure that you aren't seen as acting like a jerk yourself. Also, if you pass off as a ""mini-modder,"" people won't take too kindly to your message.

, One thing to consider is if your post fits the topic of the thread? Or whether or not your post is appropriate for the forum? If you are not sure about it, don't post it. The saying, ""no answer is better than a stupid answer"" holds quite true on a lot of forums.

, If what you want to post relates to a different topic, start a new thread.

, A lot of forums regard this as spam.

, Such behavior could be mistaken for trolling, which can get you banned from the forum.

, That is all block capitals in any part of your posts. As this is read as shouting. But this varies depending on the forum.Some forums also forbid bold or red text. Check with the forum rules.

Send your thoughts to the victims.,
Share news stories about the tragedy.,
Use the tragedy to spread awareness.,
Decide if you should say anything.,
Use caution when pointing out other tragedies people have ignored.",How to Respond to Tragedy on Social Media1," When tragedy occurs, you may want to post to send your thoughts, prayers, or support to the people involved. By doing this, you can show that you care and help process your grief. Sometimes, saying only a few words is better and more sincere than making a huge post.


For example, you may say, “My thoughts are with the families affected by this tragedy” or “My prayers are with the victims.”;
, Another way to respond to the tragedy on social media is share news stories, media coverage, videos, or other posts about the tragedy. Choose stories that reflect how you feel, or post a story you disagree with and add your own opinions to it.


Posting these stories gives you a starting point for discussion about the event. You can start by sharing your opinion about the media coverage, then responding to those who comment.
You may say, ""This is a great article about what happened"" or ""This article sways the events in favor of one side. What do you think?""

, Tragedies can be a time where you spread awareness for causes you truly believe in. Share stories, personal accounts, or opinions associated with what happened. Explain to those who follow you why the paying attention to the tragedy and the surrounding issues is so important.


For example, you may talk about rape culture, racism, homophobia, or violence against transgender people in light of specific tragedies.

, Many people respond to tragedy on social media with vacant words and cheesy, cliched statements. This can make you seem shallow or insensitive.You may choose to say nothing. Just because something happens doesn’t mean you have to say something. You don’t have to respond to anything that happens. Sometimes, the best thing to do is to post nothing.
Before you decide to respond to a tragedy on social media, think about why you want to post. If you are not personally affected by the tragedy, be honest about your motivations for making a comment on social media. Do you want attention? Do you think it’s expected? Do you feel a strong sense of grief? If your answer is one of the first two, it may be better to not respond., A common response to tragedy is to respond to posts and update statuses angrily because people are posting and showing support for this tragedy but not another tragedy. You can air your feelings to bring awareness to other similar tragedies, but don’t belittle or diminish the emotional impact of the current tragedy.For example, when a bombing happens in a place that gets international attention, people get on social media to make angry posts about other places that have been bombed with no exposure. This also happens when victims of violent crimes are talked about nationwide, but other victims of the same crime get no coverage.
When spreading awareness of other tragedies, be sensitive to each tragedy.

"
"
Keep up with the news.,
Remove related content from your feed.,
Use your post to help in some way.,
Limit your posts about the tragedy.,
Place warnings on potentially offensive or upsetting content.",How to Respond to Tragedy on Social Media2," Even if you don’t want to devote a lot of time to reading the newspaper or watching the news, you should skim headlines and stay informed about what is happening in the world. This can help you avoid making mistakes with your social media posts. You don’t want to post an innocent post that may be seen as offensive or insensitive because you didn’t know something big was happening.For example, if something tragic happens, you don’t want to post on social media complaining about something small, or celebrating something that happened.
Knowing what tragedies have occurred may help you avoid sharing links that may be considered offensive right after a tragedy. If a plane crashes, you may not want to share travel links, or if there was a huge car accident, you don’t want to post about which new car to buy.

, After a tragedy, you may want to go through your most recent posts and decide if any of them are offensive. You didn’t have any knowledge of the tragedy when you posted it, but if someone reads your social media posts now, they may not realize that and be hurt or offended.For example, if you posted a link about a violent movie or video game a day ago, you may want to take it down if a violent tragedy happens.

, Instead of just posting your thoughts or reactions, you may want to respond to the tragedy in a way that can help. You can share links and retweet posts about raising money and seeking volunteers for aid, or about helplines or organizations that are providing services at the site of the tragedy.For example, you may share a post about the Red Cross looking for blood donors, a church raising money to help families affected by the tragedy, or a humanitarian organization looking for volunteers to help with cleanup efforts.

, If you feel you need to post about the tragedy, then limit the amount of posts. You don’t want to flood your followers’ feed with an incessant stream of posts about the tragedy. Instead, post one update and share perhaps one or two links to articles.Posting too many updates can make yourself sound insincere or upset your followers. Try to use proper posting etiquette and don’t over post about the tragedy.

, You may want to share videos, images, or other graphic content with followers. However, this content may not be suitable for everyone, and some people may find it upsetting or offensive. When posting this content, make sure to place warnings on them or place them behind a cut so people will have to click on the link to see the content.


For example, if you want to show the video of someone getting murdered by a cop or footage from an explosion, this may be upsetting for some people. You should post it if you feel strongly about sharing the images, but warn others who may be triggered by the images.
Explain why you want to share these images. For example, you may say, ""This video shows what really happened instead of what the media may want you to believe"" or ""I feel the impact of this tragedy becomes much more significant when you see for yourself what happened.""

Offer support to the affected person.,
Take part in remembering along with others.,
Grieve with others.",How to Respond to Tragedy on Social Media3," Tragedy may not be on a global or national level. Tragedy may happen when someone on your Facebook or Twitter suddenly loses a family member. When this happens, you can offer support to the person to let them know you care.For example, you can simply like the post. You may decide to comment to the person with something like, “I’m sorry for your loss” or “You are in my thoughts.”
You may consider sending the person a private message with more personal words.

, When tragedy happens, you may join in the collective conversation and share your memories with others. This may be appropriate if someone well-known in the community or a famous person dies, or if a well-known landmark was destroyed in some tragic way.You can share photos of you and the person, or a photo of you at the building or landmark destroyed.
Write a post with your favorite memories of the person or the place. Sharing good memories in a time of tragedy can be a way to heal.

, If you are part of a community struck by tragedy, either geographically or culturally, you can use social media to grieve and process the tragedy. When something happens close to us, reaching out to other individuals who may understand our loss can be comforting.


You may make posts about how affected you are by the loss. You may talk about your sadness and grief, your fear, or your anger.

Read the rules and terms of use before you sign up.,
Try to use as much real information as possible, when (and if) you decide to sign up.,
Try to refrain from doing the following as much as possible:



Swearing - Yes, the site may allow it, but there may be children using the site who will feel uncomfortable in a conversation with swearing.,
If you have been banned from a forum before.,
Do not post off topic.,
Think before you post.,
Some forums also do not allow you to type in ALL CAPS, that is all block capitals in your posts.,
Do not post links to your blog or website unless you know it is allowed.,
If a forum member is rude to you, don't respond by being rude back to them, or it could get you banned.",How to Avoid Being Banned on a Forum," Is my age group allowed to use this site? Is swearing allowed? What sort of behavior is allowed? What information do I have to provide to use this website?;
, e.g. don't use a fake e-mail address, as many sites require you to verify it. If you don't want to use your real name (for security purposes), this may be acceptable. If you are going to share your geographical information make sure its true. Though most of the forums will not stress on this point however you stand a good chance of getting banned if you are lying and they catch you (using your IP).

, It's also quite annoying if used in excess.

Spamming - Spamming is when you repeatedly post one phrase over and over again, often to annoy other users. This is often to advertise another website.

Note: Spam is defined differently on different websites. A good rule of thumb is that if your topic does not encourage normal discussion, do not post it.



Using Improper English - There are many users on many websites that dislike spelling errors, grammar issues, etc. This includes Leet Speak (7@1k!n9 1!k3 7h!$), Chat Speak (lol, lmao, wtf, etc.), and just plain old misspelling of words.

Threatening Legal Action - Threatening to sue people may make them not want you to use their website.

Being Irritating - Yes, this is a pretty shallow reason why to ban somebody, considering that you may not be doing it on purpose. However, some moderators are just going to be like that.


Trolling - However, trolling is a good reason. Mean-spirited trolling is just plain annoying to people and selfish. Trolling when you first sign up for a forum can also convince mods that you aren't even a genuine forum user in the first place, making it harder to get unbanned.



, Do not post about being banned from another forum. As it could get you banned from that forum as well.

, This means stick to the topic of the thread and do not post about a subject not related to the topic. As many forums regard this a hijacking a thread. And you could get a warning from a moderator or banned on some forums. If you want to post about a different subject to the thread you are on, start a new thread.

, Many forums have different rules of what is allowed and what's not. So read the rules first and if you are not sure if your question or post fits the criteria of the forum, do not post it.

, This is seen and read as shouting, and that's rude.

, As many forums forbid this. So read the terms of service first before doing this. And if you are not sure, don't do it.

, If someone is rude to you, just ignore them.

Ask yourself why you wish to have one or more sock puppet accounts.,
Understand how Wikipedia functions.,
Know what some good reasons for operating sock puppets are.Some examples of valid uses are:


Perhaps some people you know in real life know your screen name, and you are embarrassed for them to see you editing certain articles.,
Know some reasons that are not so good for operating sock puppets.Some examples of invalid uses are:


To pretend to be two or more people aiming for a common cause in violation of Wikipedia's policies.,
Decide on your purpose for each account.,
Operate each account from a different IP address.",How to Use Sockpuppet Accounts on Wikipedia," This may help determine whether or not you are accomplishing what you want. Depending on your reason, sock puppets may or may not be the ideal way to achieve your goal., Wikipedia does not make its decisions based on vote counts. Decisions are made based on consensus, policy, and guidelines. Having two or more users say they support a cause does not have the same power as someone citing an existing policy or guideline to show something should be a certain way, or giving a good argument why a policy should change. It is not uncommon for the minority's wishes to come true when the argument is stronger, and in fact, some articles have been deleted in spite of unanimous 'votes' to keep, all because of existing policy.

,
Or maybe, no one who knows you in real life knows your screen name, but many other Wikipedians know you as an editor with a certain screen name, and you are embarrassed for them to see you edit certain articles.
Or possibly you have an account you use to edit at home, but you do not want anyone to know that is really you. It might be a good idea to have a different account to edit in public.
Or if you are afraid your main account could be hacked if you edit in public. That is another reason for having a separate account for public editing.

, Examples include edit warring or casting multiple votes in discussions. Be aware that decisions on Wikipedia are made based on the site's policies and guidelines, not numbers of votes, and sock puppets will not help under these circumstances. It would be more productive to become an expert on Wikipedia policies and guidelines, and perhaps you could use them to your advantage.
To vandalize the project. Be aware that Wikipedia has become so good at fighting vandalism that most acts of vandalism are reverted in minutes, if not seconds, and some vandalism is reverted automatically before it even appears.

, Or multiple purposes so they do not get labeled as single purpose accounts (not necessarily a bad thing).For example, you may use one account for edits about your career and your favorite TV show. Another could be used for edits pertaining to your religion and your favorite sports team.

, This is not to be malicious, but for protection of your privacy. If you have a home internet connection and a smartphone subscription, you have two connections you can use in your home right now (be aware that if you use the same WiFi you use for your home computer, it'll register as the same IP address). Also keep track of all the other connections you frequent, e.g. your work, school, a friend's or relative's house, a cafe, etc.

Special:Import is a feature in MediaWiki software that can be used by Sysops (per default) to import a small number of pages (i.e.,
If you have shell access,you could try using importDump.php.,
For large database sets, try using mwdumper .,
Xml2sql is another XML to SQL converter similar to mwdumper but it is not an official tool and is not maintained by MediaWiki developers.",How to Import XML Dumps to Your MediaWiki Wiki," anything below 20MB should be safe). Trying to import large dumps this way may result in timeouts or connection failures. There are two reasons that this happens.


The PHP upload limit found in PHP configuration file php.ini



Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.


upload_max_filesize = 20M


And also the hidden variable limiting the size in the input form. Found in the mediawiki source code, includes/SpecialImport.php



<input type='hidden' name='MAX_FILE_SIZE' value='20000000' />


You could decrease the limit by adding this in php.ini:

max_execution_time = 1000  ; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
max_input_time = 2000  ; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
; Default timeout for socket based streams (seconds) default_socket_timeout = 2000;
, Though it is the most recommended method, it gets slow when importing huge dumps. If you are trying to import something as huge as Wikipedia dumps, use mwdumper. importDump.php is a command line script located in the maintenance folder of your MediaWiki installation. If you have shell access, you can use importdump.php with this command.
php importDump.php <dumpfile>


where <dumpfile> is the name of your dump file. Even if the file is compressed in .bz2 or .gz file extension it gets decompressed automatically.
, It is a Java application that is capable of reading, writing and converting MediaWiki XML dumps to SQL dump (for later use with mysql or phpmyadmin) which can then be imported into the database directly. It is much faster than importDump.php, however, it only imports the revisions (page contents), and does not update the internal link tables accordingly -- that means that category pages and many special pages will show incomplete or incorrect information unless you update those tables.


If available, you can fill the link tables by importing separate SQL dumps of these tables using the mysql command line client directly. For Wikimedia wikis (including Wikipedia) this is provided along with the XML dumps. Otherwise, you can run rebuildall.php, which will take a long time, because it has to parse all pages. This is not recommended for large data sets.







, It is a multi-platform ANSI C program and importing via this may be fast, but does not update secondary data like link tables, so you need to run rebuildall.php, which nullifies that advantage.

Create a Wikipedia account - Account creation is not required; however, if you register for an account, you will be given more privileges than a non-registered user.,
Expand stubs.,
Add a Photo - An encyclopedia is not complete without pictures.,
Write a New Article - Wikipedia is rapidly growing, although the growth has slowed down since 2008.,
Remove Spam - Wikipedia is accessed by millions of people every day, thus, there tends to be a lot of vandalism or spamming.,
Helping Out - Even though Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, it is also a community.,
Doing Maintenance - You can help Wikipedia run optimally by doing maintenance tasks like removing copyright violations, fixing up articles, participating in deletion processes, and all sorts of other things.

,
Revert vandalism - using tools if you like.",How to Contribute to Wikipedia," For all of these privileges to take place, your account must be at least four days old and have at least ten edits.

, An article that is not complete, or written in full detail, may be marked with a {{Stub}} tag. You can help by adding content to the articles currently marked as stubs. Articles may also have a more detailed {{stub}} meaning that the stub has been sub-sorted. Sub-sorted stubs include anything from Arts, Cultures, Design, Broadcast Media, Radio, Television, Literature, and more!

, You can upload as many pictures as you wish; however, you must provide detailed information on the source and the license of the file. If you cannot provide that information, do not upload any photos. If you still choose to upload photos, they will be deleted.

, The English version of Wikipedia currently has over 5,168,000 articles! You can help continue this growth by writing an article of your own. You should write an article about something you are very knowledgeable about, so that you can write a complete and informative article. Articles created as test pages, pure vandalism, attack pages, etc. will be deleted on the spot, without any further debate.

, People who vandalize or spam a page may have added inappropriate links, blanked the page, added nonsense, etc. You can help out by removing, or reverting, this vandalism. Removing vandalism will make Wikipedia a better place for people to gather information and resources.

, You can help out newcomers to make it a bigger and better community for the encyclopedia.

,, If you're getting good at it you'll get a tool called 'rollback' that lets you revert vandalism faster. Remember, spam is also vandalism! If somebody is persistent about vandalising a page, report them to the 'Administrator Intervention against Vandalism' board - AIV for short - once they have been warned suitably.

Create an account.,
Become an active member of the community and make good contributions.,
Become an administrator.,
Be an active administrator.,
Decide if you actually want to be a bureaucrat.,
Study old bureaucrat requests at the requests for adminiship board to understand what is expected of bureaucrats.,
Go to the requests for adminship page, and in the box that says ""Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/USERNAME,"" replace ""adminship"" with ""bureaucratship,"" and ""USERNAME"" with your Wikipedia username.,
Remove the requests for adminship template, and replace it with {{subst:RfB|User=USERNAME|Description=YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE USER}} Put in your username where it says ""USERNAME"" and your description of why you want to be a bureaucrat where it says ""YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE USER."",
Click on ""Edit Page"" at the top of the page, and answer the three standard questions.,
Copy the code {{Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/USERNAME}} and paste it at the top of the requests for bureaucratship list.,
Go through the process.",How to Become a Wikipedia Bureaucrat," Only registered users can become bureaucrats.;
, Make your contributions in a variety of areas such as editing articles, creating articles, participating in site discussions, and reverting vandalism.

, You're not actually required to be an administrator to become a bureaucrat, but the community will look more favorably of you if you're an administrator. You're likely to fail your nomination if you're not an administrator (and in the most likely case, your nomination will be ended early through the site's snowball clause and/or ""not now"" clause).

, When you first start, it's a good idea to read the site's new admin school page to understand the privileges that administrators have and how to use them correctly. While you're an administrator, you should be active in a variety of administrative tasks such as deleting bad pages, blocking users, and participating in administrator discussions. You should be active in the administrators' noticeboard.

, Being a bureaucrat is hard work, and takes more time than being an administrator. Read the site's page on bureaucrats to see if being a bureaucrat is for you. If you make a nomination for bureaucrat when you don't really want it, you're likely to fail your nomination.

, See why people succeed and why they fail and make note of what you observe.

, Click on ""Nominate yourself"" when you're done.

, After the description, sign your nomination with four tildes (~). Click on ""Save Page"" when you're done.

, Click on ""Save Page"" when you're done.

, If there are no other nominations, replace the template that says this instead. Replace the ""adminship"" with ""bureaucratship"" and ""USERNAME"" with your username. Click on ""Save Page"" when you're done.

, Answer any questions that other users give you, and participate in discussions on the page. After seven days of discussion, if you have enough support from other users, you'll become a bureaucrat.

Know what Wikipedia is.,
Put it in your Bookmarks tab, and try to devote a folder to articles of interest on Wikipedia.,
Start visiting the site often.,
Start contributing!",How to Be a Wikipedian," Wikipedia's slogan is ""The free encyclopedia that anyone can edit."" That means two things:


Wikipedia is in fact an encyclopedia. Like Britannica, it is meant to provide detailed knowledge on a topic, more so than a dictionary but less so than an entire book on the subject. Side note: having reliable sources in a description is crucial to Wikipedia's accuracy. If it doesn't source, you shouldn't cite. Simple as that.
Wikipedia can, has been, and will be vandalized. It is, after all, an encyclopedia that anyone can edit. For example, on the date of 10/29/08, an unnamed Wikipedian searched ""wikipedia"" on Wikipedia, and found only ""a piece of CR@P"" for a description. Whosoever did this should and likely is banned from contributing to the site again, but this does show that even the most comprehensive article of something can be vandalized. So look out.;
, You may be surprised at how many times you use Wikipedia if it's there as a click, and not 20-something letters away. Moreover, you will likely find some interesting stuff on Wikipedia. Here are some links to certain things that are very interesting:


William James Sidis, polymath with an IQ of 300.
Technocracy, a theoretical government where scientists & engineers rule.
Constructed languages.

, Revisit old pages, press ""Random Article"" a thousand times, or even play the game Wiki Wars, described below. You'll improve your IQ dramatically by doing this, and who knows? Maybe, just maybe, you'll find your passion in one of those articles.


OPTIONAL: Rules For Wiki Wars
Press ""Random Article"" once.
Open a second tab, go to Wikipedia, and press ""Random Article"" again.
Keep clicking links on one of the tabs until you reach the other (no, you can't use the search box).

, Once you find a topic that you'd like to share some knowledge on, start doing some research & create some articles. Alternatively, many people also clean up old articles, articles that have to be translated, etc. After all, not everybody in the world is smart enough to shed a lot of light on a topic-that's why there are so many stubs of articles out there. Eventually, you will rise up through the system, & may even become an administrator for your work.

"
"
Do not attempt to bypass the global ban by making a other account or a sockpuppet.,
Contact the person who globalled you.,
Contact Wikia Staff in general if you don't get anywhere with the single person who made the block.,
State your case clearly and politely.,
Wait for a response.",How to Cope if You Get Globalled from Wikia," Wikia staff or VSTF can see your IP address and will simply reglobal block you again.

If you need to do make a new account, you will need to change your IP address via a proxy or VPN.;
, It may be Wikia staff or even VSTF. You can get their email address and email them. If you can't find it, go on., You can contact the staff members via:

http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Contact/general
Telephone (refer to Wikia's website)
Email.

, Start out by explaining to the Wikia Staff what the situation is. For example if it was a mistake, explain why you think this; or, explain whatever other reason you wish to put forward, that led to you being globalled (vandalism, ToS violation or other). Then ask that the global ban be lifted. Then click send.

Be sure to explain why you won't do whatever it is that you did again. Be honest and genuine––making up lies or excuses will only annoy people even more.

, You will get a reply from someone who works for Wikia within two to three business days. Accept the response. If they lift the ban, be respectful of the site and say thank you. If you are not ungloballed, don't try to bypass the global ban. Simply send back an email saying thanks for considering your case and that you look forward to being able to edit again when things improve. When you do return, don't do whatever you did to get globalled again."

Decide whether you want to become a Wikipedia admin or not.,

, five or six) and make a lot of good changes (eg. at least a few thousand edits) which help build the encyclopedia. When editing, try to:


Use edit summaries.
Avoid controversy and edit wars.
Engage in a collaborative and constructive manner (building good and featured articles or expanding stubs).
Do maintenance tasks like reverting vandalism, removing copyright material, and participating in deletion processes.
Enable your e-mail address for communication.
Get a grasp of the basics of Wikipedia policy by reading the Administrators' reading list.

, The way the nomination process works is to seek consensus by supporting the user and giving user constructive criticism (opposing) from the editors. Your previous work will be reviewed thoroughly before a decision is reached.

,,, Some editors will grill you with additional questions. After around a week, a bureaucrat will decide whether consensus has been reached and will close your RfA. Usually nominations that have an 80% or higher amount of support will pass, and 70% and lower will fail. Nominations in between are subject to ""crat chats"", where several bureaucrats will discuss whether or not to promote you.

Look up an article or sentence that needs a source.,
Get one or more sources.,
Add the sources to the articles.",How to Add References to Wikipedia," You may possibly want to use Category:Articles lacking sources if you want to find articles that need sources in general, or Category:All articles with unsourced statements if you are looking for articles with specific sentences that should have a source. Of course, if you already know which article/statement you want to add a reference to, then just go there.;
, If you already have them, then it's fine. If you do not, then you can use a site like Google to find sources, or maybe check your bookshelf.

, If it is a single statement, then write <ref>The source</ref> after the statement, and then== References ==
{{reflist}}
on the bottom of the article (but above categories and interwiki links). If it is not a single statement, then add== References ==
* The source
to the bottom of the page (but above categories and interwikis).

Use the site if you need research and that you can't find any other website that has better information.,
Time yourself.,
Taper your time limit.,
Try to get addicted to another site.,
Don't give up!,
Tell the truth if you were on Wikipedia while not setting up the timer.",How to Avoid Getting Addicted to Wikipedia," To help avoid getting addicted to Wikipedia, do not create an account and then write articles.;
, Start by limiting yourself to 1-2 hours every week. This can be helpful if you can buy a loud timer. You can go on it every day, but it it better to not go on it unnecessarily every day, or else you might be on the road to getting addicted to Wikipedia again.

, Once you are used to the idea that you are limited to Wikipedia, slowly reduce your time until somewhere like 5-10 minutes every 2 days.

, Take wikiHow for example. Wikipedia is very different from this site that you are currently on because Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, while wikiHow is a How-to manual. There are probably more than 2.5 million articles in English in that site. Try Youtube. You can watch short videos on that site.

, If you give up, that means you failed and you will have to go on that site over and over again. It is hard, but if you start to limit your time, it should be a little easier. In some people's beliefs, giving up is actually a sign of weakness.

, It could be the road to...you get the point, right? If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember what you said.

Click on General (should be the first button).
Go to the 'Change admin password' tab.

, Even if you are the only editor that will be using your account, you will probably want to have a non-admin account to edit with.


If you do add a user, try using another browser for that user to log in with. That way you don't have to log in and out with your Admin account while configuring Tiki.

, This is where you will be doing the bulk of your initial setup.

, The screenshot has a few basic ones selected.

, This allows you to select specific user options.

, Be aware that any template changes you made before would have to be redone.

, Some of the items you might want to change are:


Add content in the Custom Site Header area.
Add your own logo and site name in the Site Logo and Title area.
Enable (or disable) the Site Search Bar and Login Bar.
Enable (or disable) the Left and Right columns.
Enable (or disable) the Top and Bottom bars.
Enable (or disable) the icons and debugging information in the Bottom bar.

, Try adding 'Online Users'. Once you have selected it, the screen will automatically refresh so that you will see what it will do. You can now change options. Make these changes.


Position: Select left. You will add this module to the left column.
Order: Select 5. This will place the new module above the menu.
Flip: Type y. This will include the Toggle(Toggle icon) in the module, allowing you to ""roll up"" the module.
Select Registered. This way, only registered users will see the list.

,, You (and your users) can edit this page to learn the Tiki wiki syntax. No versions of the page are retained, so you don't have to worry about spam.
Comments: This allows registered users to add comments to the page (without actually editing the wiki page). You can further customize Tiki by specifying if the comments should be displayed by default and how they are ordered. You can override this setting on a page-by-page basis.
Pictures: This allows you to upload pictures and images to a wiki page. By default, uploaded pictures will be stored in the File Gallery.
Backlinks: ""Backlinks"" are a list of wiki pages that link to a specific page. Tiki can automatically keep this list of incoming links up-to-date. You can customize the length (number of characters) displayed in the backlink drop list. This can be useful if you have very long page names.

Click on the edit icon. There are two different icons for editing. One will edit the whole page, another will edit the section.

Icon for editing a section of the page.


Type in ((MyNewPage)) into the editor and look at Preview.

Under comments, enter a short explanation of what you are doing. It helps when reviewing page history.
Because there is no such page, you have created your first broken link.


Fix your broken link. Click on the question mark. This will open up the editor to that page. Make your edits and Click on save.

Creating new wiki pages by using this method (creating links from exiting pages) avoids the problem of orphan pages. An orphan is a wiki page that is not linked to any other page.


Click on backlinks (in the upper left corner). The backlinks are the pages that are linked to the current page.
Click on Home Page. You will notice that your previous broken link is no longer broken.

, Be sure that you have added that particular module.


Type in the name of your desired page and click on Create/Edit.
Make the appropriate changes.
Add the comment.
Save your page.

This method has the disadvantage of automatically being orphaned unless you go immediately to the appropriate page and create the link.

Figure out what your specific niche will be.,
Choose a forum script.,
Find a good forum hosting program.,
Start creating your forum or discussion areas.,
Advertise your forum to get users.,
Make posts to your forum.",How to Start a Forum,"


Since this will be your forum, it is best to pick something in which you are interested and knowledgeable. Since there are already so many forums out there, it is best to have a defined niche. Something well-defined will help your forum get noticed by the search engines and also help attract your audience. You do not want something too general or too common in forums. You can always add a ""general chit chat"" area for any off topic business.;
,


There are many different forum scripts available. It is best to start with a free forum script. Make sure that it is able to move information to another forum script should you want to change later. A good free script that does allow you to transfer your information is phpBB. This is the script that many web hosts offer as part of their packages as well. When you want to change to a paid forum script, vBulletin is a good one and it comes with a migration tool for phpBB, which will allow you to easily transfer all your forum information without losing anything.

,


You can choose to set up your own message board using software if you have experience with web development. If not, you will have to have a host. You will need a good host that does not have many problems or downtime.

,


You will want to start off with about 5 to 10 forums. They should all be related to the main topic of your board. You do not want to over categorize your forum as it many confuse and put off users.

,


Once your forum is up and running, you will need to have users to make your community. If you have friends that are online and have similar interests, you can e-mail or instant message them to let them know you have started a new forum. If you have your own website or blog, you can make a post to announce the grand opening of your forum to your readers. If you are already active in other forums, you can add a link to your forum in your signature. Search online for other forums that are related to your niche. Start contributing to discussions there and add a link to your signature.

,


As the originator, you should be making posts all the time. Respond to posts by your members and start topics that will provoke conversations among the members. If you have members that are active in your community, you can have them be moderators so that they will be encouraged to stick around and post more.

Consider the different types of ""cool"" email.,
Name your email after your interests.,
Consider including your name.",How to Create a Cool Email Address1," Some emails are cool because they're kooky and unique. Others are cool because they're simple, classy, and professional. Still others find an engaging and original way to express your interests. You'll need to decide what you want your email address to say about you.


A kooky email address could be anything from random words to a few of your basic interests. It could be ""kangaroogirl@example.com"" or ""caffeine.fiend.17@example.com"" or ""green_eggs_and_bacon@example.com"".
A personality-based address might be something that speaks to some of your deepest interests or values. For instance: ""mellow.cello@example.com"" or ""because.its.there@example.com"". The goal here is to make people smile and show them what makes you unique.
A more professional address might be something that uses your name or your business in an interesting-sounding way. If your name is Billy Bones, you could use ""bbones@example.com"". If your name is Catherine, you could use ""cath.arsis@example.com"". Bear in mind that a professional email address should include your name or business name, and it shouldn't be as wild as your personal email.;
, Think about what you're interested in (and what you want people to know you're interested in), and try to incorporate these things into your email address. If you play guitar, for example, you could use the word ""guitar"" in your address. If you love strawberries, you could be ""strawberry.girl"".


Think of a word that sounds interesting before or after your interest, and combine the two to form your email address. For example, if you choose to incorporate your love of guitar into your email address, you could use ""guitardude97"" or ""guitarjams"".
Be aware that your interests may change. Try to choose something that you think you'll love for a while – not just the flavor of the week.

, It can be your initials, last name, first name, middle name, even full name. Since you want it to be cool, try to pair it with something else that describes you – such as your interests.

"
"
Try combining two words to make one.,
Try not to make a generic or random address.,
Add periods or numbers to spice up your name.,
Try intentionally misspelling words.",How to Create a Cool Email Address2," For example, ""crocodile"" and ""rocket"" can be combined to make the word ""BettyCrocker."" Try to match words with the same beginning syllables to words that have similar endings. Another good method is to take a word that you like, such as ""laser"" or ""turbo"" and use it to describe another word, such as ""laserboulder"" or ""turbocandy."" The word you are describing can be quite random.


You may want to capitalize the first letter of each word instead of an underscore to indicate a separation. ""LaserBoulder"" or ""TurboCandy"".

, Avoid abstract numbers or birth years, as these are rather common and may take away from the originality of your address. Again, however, you might consider using more ""generic"" style elements if you plan to eventually use this email for professional purposes.


""james.madison.98@example.com"" or ""joeksmith@example.com"" are examples of ""generic"" email addresses. On the other hand, they are simple and straightforward. It all comes down to what you think is ""cool"".
""AKDJFIADJF@example.com"" or ""shabalaba810@example.com"" are instances of ""random"" addresses. They might be cool, but they won't say much about you.

, If you find something that you get attached to, but it's already taken, think about throwing in some periods or numbers. These can be meaningful or random, to your taste. For instance:


dragon.finding.warrior@example.com
redinkedbooks2015@example.com
chocolate.adventures5@example.com

, This can be a great way to make your email address more unique, and it may help you keep the core of your idea if someone else has already reserved the address that you want. Make sure the misspelled word still looks or sounds similar to the correct word; it should be recognizable, even if it isn't exact. Try replacing S with Z, or a ""ks"" sound with an X.


""lovinpandaz@example.com"" and ""pizzas.and.pizzazz@example.com"" play with the ""S"" and ""Z"" sound.
""the.sox.rox@example.com"" and ""madd.haxx@example.com"" both replace the ""ks"" sound with an ""x"".

"
"
Ask somebody for help.,
Choose a domain host.,
Sign up for an email account.",How to Create a Cool Email Address3," Ask anyone who knows you well or anyone who you think might be good at naming things. This could be a friend, a relative, or a parent. If you don't like their answers, don't worry about it and try to think of one on your own.


Consider using a username generator, if you don't know anyone who can help you. Run a web search for ""username generator"", and you may be able to create something suitable.

, The domain of an email address is the ""@example.com"" part. Any standard email client should be fine, although some domains (like AOL or Hotmail) might come across as a bit dated. Some sites will allow you to choose a custom domain; if you take this route, avoid choosing a long domain, as people might not want to type out a long address. Domains like ""@gmail.com"" or ""@yahoo.com"" are short, popular, and easy to remember.

, When you're ready, visit an email client, click whichever variation of ""create an account"" you find, and proceed to create your very own cool email address. Type the email address you decided on into the proper ""username"" or ""login name"" field.

, If a theme doesn't quite look right, it may not have been updated for your version. The theme page has a list of themes that have been updated...or they just may not work right for you.

, In this instance, the FiveAlive theme is what you are clicking on. When you do, you will see a list of potential themes.

, The one selected here is Candii Clouds. A definite girly theme. Also, note how the screen actually looks (aside from the atrocious pink).


When choosing a theme, consider how it can affect your eyes and perception after long periods of staring at the screen.

, They will vary according to the theme. This particular one is Jqui and Trontastic. Eye-catching to be sure.

, You will want to save it to your computer. The final selection is FluidIndex.

,,


Local System: wherever you put the unpacked files
Remote system: In a Windows TikiWiki, the path is

, If the theme is constructed correctly, it should be an easy process. If that doesn't work, do the following.

, It will tell you what goes where. Using the FluidIndex example of before:


Find the 'fluidindex' folder that contains the credits.tpl and index.php. Transfer that folder into the styles folder.

public_html/wiki/templates/styles/fluidindex/credits.tpl
public_html/wiki/templates/styles/fluidindex/index.php


Put the *.css file in the Styles folder.

Brainstorm creative business domain names.,
Register and purchase your domain name on a hosting service website.,
Consider whether you would like to use paid hosting or free hosting.,
Browse the hosting website to find different package options.,
Purchase a web hosting account on the hosting website.,
Log into your account on the hosting website and click the control panel.,
Designate how much disk space you will require for your email account.,
Access your email through the hosting website.,
Open Outlook if your hosting site does not have its own web mail feature.,
Input the username and password that you registered with the hosting site.,
Specify your ingoing and outgoing server type.,
Type the ingoing and outgoing server address next to their respective fields.,
Select More Settings → Outgoing Server.,
Click the Advanced tab.,
Set the incoming server port to 143 and outgoing server to 2500 for an IMAP setup.,
Select Next and then Finish to save the changes.,
Go to www.zoho.com/mail/ and click the ""Get Started"" button.,
Select the ""Free & Ad-Free"" option on the far right of the page.,

Select ""Save Zone File"" or ""Save"" or ""Add Records"" to save the changes.",How to Create a .Com Email Address," The domain name is everything that follows the ""@"" symbol and will be representative of your business.


Think of names that pertain to your business. For example, if your business is titled ""Angel's Hawaiian Shirts,"" choose a domain name like ""angelhawaiianT.com,"" or ""hawaiianshirts.com.""
Be creative but have some restraint as well. You want your domain name to be catchy and short enough that people will remember your email address easily in case they wish to contact you.
For example, instead of a long domain name like ""angelsqualityhawaiiantshirts.com,"" use a slightly shorter but unique domain name like ""angelichawaiianT.com.""
Be sure to think of more than 1 possible domain name. Often times people will have similar businesses selling similar goods and will have selected the name you have come up with. To avoid this, customize your domain name using clever wordplay. This not only makes your domain name more memorable, it will increase the chances of you being able to register it.
For example, if your business is titled ""Heavenly Pies"" and sells various baked goods, use a domain name like ""sliceofheaven.com."";
, Hosting the email address itself can be free if using a free service, but registering domains will always require payment.


Reputable hosting services include GoDaddy.com, Register.com, and eNom.com. These services all work with the ICANN database, which is in charge of keeping track of all domain names. They should all deliver the same information (such as domain name availability).

, Paid and free hosting services each have their benefits and downfalls.


Paid services often provide more control over your email address in terms of capabilities.For example, you'll be able to create many different emails and pick up your email directly from the web host. You'll also be able to add auto-responders (automated email responses), aliases, and even mailing lists.
Another added bonus of paid hosting is that you'll be able to add a website in the future, even if it is just a holding website with your contact details.
Free hosting is not only easier on the wallet, it also tends to be easier to use than paid hosting., Like buying phone or cable television services, there are specific packages that are offered based on your preferences and budget.


For example, some GoDaddy packages are specifically tailored for smaller businesses and offer up to 5 email accounts.This will cost less money than the premium business package, or ""business plus,"" which may offer more features and more email accounts.

, Web hosting is a paid service that also comes with email hosting. You can do this on sites like GoDaddy, UserMail, FuseMail, or EasyDNS.


Be prepared with your billing information. You will be prompted to fill out multiple forms before you are able to log into your account.
Before you buy your email hosting account, you can ask the provider questions that will be crucial to your decision. Ask things like, ""How many accounts can I create?"" or ""Does your website offer 24 hour technical support?"" These are questions that will be especially important while running your business.

, This is where you will begin creating an email address.


The control panel may be titled many things but should revolve around the words ""control"" or ""account."" For instance, it may be called ""account manager,"" ""control panel,"" ""account settings,"" etc. Once you navigate to the control panel, find an option that involves the word ""email."" This can be titled various things such as ""email users,"" ""email accounts, etc."" Click this option and follow the prompts for creating an email address.
The procedure for creating an address closely resembles the procedure for creating accounts on public sites like Gmail or Yahoo. Simply input your real name, username, and password.

, Public sites like Gmail have set disk space for emails, but your private domain's storage capacity will vary depending on the package you have purchased.


For instance, if you purchased the basic business hosting package on GoDaddy, you may only have access to 10 GB available. You will then need to allocate how much of that space is dedicated to email.

, If you signed up on GoDaddy, use the web mail feature that comes with the service.

, Sites like FuseMail and EasyDNS use external programs like Outlook to host email.

, Your username will reflect your registered domain even though it is being accessed through Outlook.

, The server type will either be ""POP"" or ""IMAP."" These are protocols that mail programs use to access mail stored on remote computers.If they have not yet been provided, ask your hosting company for the ingoing and outgoing server type.
POP stands for ""Post Office Protocol"" and works by downloading mail to your computer. IMAP stands for ""Internet Message Access Protocol"" and works by keeping mail on the server.

, The address will vary depending on if you use POP or IMAP.


If you use IMAP, type ""imap..net"" into the incoming mail server field. For example, if you use FuseMail, type ""imap.fusemail.net."" Do the same for POP, except substitute ""pop"" for ""imap."" For example, ""pop.fusemail.net.""For outgoing mail server, type in ""smtp..net."" This is the same for both POP and IMAP. For example, ""smtp.fusemail.net.""

, Select ""My outgoing server (SMTP) requires authentication"" and check the box next to ""use same settings as my incoming server.""

, Set the incoming server and outgoing server encrypted connection to ""None.""

, For a POP setup, set the incoming to 110 and outgoing to 2500 and check ""Leave a copy of messages on the server."" Click ""OK"" after setting the server ports.

, You should now be able to access your mail from Outlook.

, Zoho Mail is a hosting service that offers both paid hosting and a limited free hosting package.The ""Get Started"" button is a red rectangular button. It is located under the large header that says ""Take Control of Your Inbox"" in the upper center portion of the page.

, You will notice that the storage space (5 GB) and Docs Storage (5 GB) are significantly lower than the paid hosting packages.

, Type in the URL exactly as it appears on your purchase receipt.


For example, www.angelshawaiianshirts.com.

, Go to Control Panel>Mail Accounts and select the account ""username@zoho.com.""

, Your domain name should already be selected if you only have one registered.


If you have multiple domains, click the drop box and select the domain for which you would like an email account.

, Like other email accounts, this is the initial password and can always be changed later if you wish.

, You will now need to change the MX records in order to begin receiving mail on Zoho. The MX records of your domain point to which servers will be receiving your mail. By directing them to Zoho, you will be able to begin receiving mail on your newly made account.

, This lists all the domains you have registered.


Registrar websites often have different names for the domain control panel. Look for similar names like ""DNS manager"" or ""Domain Management Page."" You are basically looking for the control panel for all your domain settings.

, Again, this tab will be titled differently based on the registrar website but should revolve around email or MX settings.

, This will be your first email account attached to the domain. To add accounts in the future, you will need to revisit this tab.

, You have now redirected mail to your Zoho account.

, Priority levels determine which domain account will receive email. The account with the highest priority is the one which will receive the email.If you have multiple accounts, choose which one you want to receive email. Registrar websites will either ask for a numerical value or offer settings of ""High,"" ""Medium,"" or ""Low"" priority. Select High for your preferred account. If you are inputting a numerical value, give your preferred account a lower number than your other accounts. The lowest number means highest priority.
Numerical values typically use 10 as the lowest numerical value. Thus, if you have another account which you do not wish to receive email, you would input 20 for that account.

, The changes may not immediately be reflected but have been saved and will be implemented.


If you want the changes to be reflected as soon as possible, change the TTL field to the lowest possible value before saving changes. This will decrease the time it takes for the changes to take effect. Know that the TTL may not be editable for some registrar sites.

Decide whether you really have enough time to start a new forum or not.,
Ask yourself what your technical forum will have to offer over the others.,

Consider whether you want to make a secondary account to post on.,
Fix up your main website, and focus it on technical things as well as your forum.,
Begin to promote the forum when you have about 15 topics or more going in your boards.,
Manage your forum.",How to Start a Technical Forum," Running a forum comes with a lot of responsibilities, which include:


Getting enough active members to keep the forum going on its own.
Making or finding someone to make a good, clean layout.
Advertising your forum and providing material to draw prospective members in.
Finding moderators to help you manage your community and enforce your rules.
Doing some moderator work yourself.
Most likely paying money to host this forum.;
, If they can find one that's already active and has many topics, what would make them come to yours? Try to find strengths where other forums are weak.

, You should find a host that supports PHP or MySQL, so you can run your forum on it. A domain will also be useful for hosting a main website that prospective users can explore.

, You can use sites such as phpBB, Invision Power, vBulletin, or SMF. It would probably be helpful to learn some coding so you can easily customize your forum without too much headache.

, The instructions may be included with things you download from their site, or located on their website itself.

, A custom layout will make your forum stand out and give your forum its own personal touch.

, Keep in mind that too many boards can emphasize how empty your forum is and seem daunting to a new user, so only make the necessary boards at first. When your forum activity picks up, you can expand and create more boards as needed.

, Some people designate a topic for this in every board, and some people just make a general TOS for the entire forum, while others do both.

, Create five different topics, for example, in each forum. Make sure they're intriguing and compel the reader to join and give their opinion on the topic. Invite and encourage discussion.

, Make sure they're posting actual content, not just, ""Hey dude, posting on your forum like you asked, LOL!"" Who knows? They might become long-time contributing members.

, Some people resort to making multiple identities to make their board seem more active than it is. The pro is that it makes your forum seem active, and invite new members. The con is that you'd essentially be lying, you may be found out, and it may be exhausting to keep up the act.

, On your main website, you could host your own blog where you discuss technical news and tutorials. This gives your forum fuel for discussion as well as a way for people to discover your website via search engines.

, You can try using the following ways to promote your website:


Craigslist- You can post an ad inviting people to post articles on your blog in exchange for a link back to their blog. This does three things: get your website out there, draw attention to your site and forum, and generate content for other people to read and discuss.
Forum signatures- If you're a member of any forums, you may want to stick a link or banner in your signature for people to click. It may not generate as much traffic, but it does help get some people involved.
Word of mouth- Tell your friends to come join you on the forum. If they're not too interested or don't have much to say, you can ask them to post tech help questions for people, such as yourself, to answer. Ask them to tell their friends and so on.
Host a contest- This usually works best if the prize is something with cash value. The terms of the contest can range from posting (which may hurt in that it promotes spam) to recruiting (which may not help activity).

, Now is the time to find moderators as you settle in and prepare to manage your community. Start to develop connections with your members and do what's necessary to keep the peace.

You will see a very long list of templates. You should have an idea of what you are looking for. For example: if you want to edit your SendMail template, hold down CTRL F (for your find feature) and search for SendMail. If you don't find it, experiment with spacing or check your spelling.
If you decide to customize your template files, you should create your own theme instead of changing an existing theme's template files. This will make future Tiki upgrades easier — you don't want to overwrite your customizations each time you upgrade!

, If one parent gets on your side, he/she can also work to convince the other parent.

, Parents are usually very concerned about safety of their kids on-line, so tell them about safety features. Hotmail, for example, let's you make your own safety features, so unknown e-mail addresses are deleted before you can read them. This way, spammers and people that send you viruses and inappropriate emails will not be a problem.

Save any emails, photos, or documents from your old email.,
Spend any money that you have on your account.,
Save any of the product keys or passwords on your email.,
Message your contacts that you are closing the account.,
Cancel subscriptions linked to the account.",How to Close Old Email Accounts1," Save those documents to your computer or cloud storage. Before you close your account, make sure that you look through any places in your email where old pictures, files, or documents are stored. Additionally, look through old emails for any email exchanges that you may want to save. Some of these documents might be valuable to you.If you are going to close your entire account, not just your email, and have a Microsoft account: Live, Msn, Hotmail, or Outlook, you should save or download any of your documents or files saved to your OneDrive. Or if you have any information on your Xbox, make sure it is backed up before you close your Microsoft account. None of the progress that you have made on your games or scores will be saved after you close your account.;
, First, sign into the account website in order to see if you have any money on your account. You may have loaded money onto your account for a variety of reasons. For example, you may have put money on your account to call abroad when you were out of the country.


If you have a Microsoft account, spend the money on digital content in the Windows Store, the Windows Phone Store, or Xbox before you close your account.
Likewise, other providers like Google will have stores where you can purchase media before you close your account.

, Product keys are for products you purchased through Microsoft. A product key is the 25 character code that comes with a Microsoft product and allows you to activate your product. In case you have to reinstall your product, you should save this code. Also, if you have passwords for websites or services saved on your email, do a search for passwords, and save those in a new document/ location.


If you purchased any products like Microsoft Office online, you had to purchase it through an email account. Try typing “product key” or @DIGITALRIVER.COM, @TRY.OFFICEFORMAC.COM, or BUY.OFFICEFORMAC.COM into the search bar to find the email with the product key code and the order number. Save the entire email in a new document and location.

, Let your friends, family and professional contacts know how to reach you. Go to the contacts page in your email, and select the boxes next to each contact that you want to notify that you are closing your account. Then select “Email” in the group details pane if you have Gmail.Write an email that informs your contacts that you are closing your account, and give them a new email address that they can reach you at.
Ask your contacts to update their contact information to your new email address.

, If you are going to close the whole account, not just your email, make sure you cancel your subscriptions. For example, if you have a Microsoft account, you may have OneDrive or Office 365 subscriptions. Sign into your Microsoft account website, and go to ""Services and subscriptions"". Cancel any of the paid subscriptions you have, and follow the instructions to unsubscribe.


If you have any other subscriptions through your email account but not with your service, go to the support page of any services or retailers you have subscriptions with, for example, Skype. Locate the information for how to cancel your subscription, and follow the necessary steps. "

Set up email forwarding and automated replies.,
Go to the email app to delete your email.,
Navigate to the page to delete your account.,
Confirm that you want to close the account.,
Reopen your email account.",How to Close Old Email Accounts2," These are two features that will help you phase out of your old email. If people continue to email you after you have closed your account an automated reply will tell them where they can now reach you. You can also have those emails forwarded to you at your new email address. However, some email accounts will close completely after a waiting period, and automated replies and email forwarding will stop after that time.


For example, If you have a Microsoft account, go to “Managing your account”, and select “Email forwarding”. Enter in the new email address you want your emails to be forwarded to. Under “Managing your account” you can also select “Sending automated vacation replies”, and follow the steps to write the automated message.
When you delete your Gmail account, it will not close or reuse your email, because you will still have an account through Google.
If you have an Outlook.com email address, your old email address can be recycled to another user after 60 days.

, For example, go to Gmail, and do not go to Google Accounts. The reason this can be confusing is that you use your email account to sign into your Google account, so be careful not to delete your Google account if you are trying to delete your email. If you delete your entire account with Google, for example, you will loose your YouTube account and Google search history. Delete the email address by going to the settings for the Gmail app.

, This page may be under your ""Settings"" or the ""Manage your account"" tab. If you have trouble locating the page, go to the support page for your email service, and use Ctrl+F to search for “delete my account”, or just “delete”. Follow the steps and navigate to the page to delete your account.


You will have to re-enter the password to your account to confirm your identity and delete your account.
There will be a list of reasons why you want to delete the account. Choose whichever reason applies to you, or click “Other” and write in your response.

, The service will most likely try to convince you to keep your account. Continue to the bottom of the page, and confirm that you want to close your account.


For example, in Microsoft emails the final step will say “Mark account for closure”, click on this button to finish the process and delete your account.

, If you change your mind and want your account back, log back into your email account, and proceed through steps to reactivate the account. Most email providers will wait for a period before they permanently close your account. Check with your email service to see how long their waiting period is by looking at the FAQs or Support page for information on their account closing policies.


For example, for Microsoft, they will wait 60 days before they will completely close the account and reuse your email address.

Get your username or password if you cannot access your email.,
Recover your email if it has been hacked.,
Create another email address that is linked to your current email.",How to Close Old Email Accounts3," If the reason you want to close the account is because you are unable to access your account, you can go through the steps to recover your username and password instead of closing the account. Generally, under the login fields of the sign in page, there is a smaller link that asks if you have forgotten your password. Answer any security questions or use a temporary password that is sent to you in a message to an alternate email access to unlock your account.


If you are still unable to access your email account after going through the password recovery steps, call the customer support for your service. They will assist you in accessing your account., If you are closing your account because it has been hacked, you can recover your email without having to close the account. Follow the steps below to set your email account straight:


Send emails to your contact list informing them that your email was hacked and that they should not click on any links in emails from you.
If your computer is infected with malware, update any security software, install software to remove the malware, or take the computer to a professional to have the malware removed.Change your password by going to the settings in your email and resetting your password.
Finally, contact your email provider and complete any steps so they can help you secure your email. , If you do not like the name you chose for your email address and want to create a more professional email address, this may be a good option for you. You can create a new email address through your old email account and the two email addresses will share the same inbox. However, you can send and receive emails with this new email address. You will have the best of both worlds, you will still be able to correspond with contacts who have your old email address, but you can give your new contacts a new email address. If you have Yahoo, for example, sign in to your account, and mouse over the Settings gear icon in your account. Click on “Accounts”, then “Create Address”, and then check the availability of email addresses you want. When you find one you like, click “Choose”. Last, answer the CAPTCHA code to confirm that you are a human making this account, and go to your new inbox. "

Grasp the Real Nature of the Problem: Junk mail, spam, undesired bulk electronic messages – whatever we call it, it’s all about exploiting human traits like curiosity, greed and insecurity for financial gain.,
Avoid E-mail Spamming Lists: When surfing the net, don’t give out your e-mail address or any other personal details unless it’s really necessary.,
Keep A Healthy Skepticism: Clicking on the link or attachment of a spam message is always is simply asking for trouble.,
Security Gives Peace of Mind: Resisting spam is important for maintaining a healthy computer, so you can enjoy your online experience to the full.",How to Control Email Spam," Spamming e-mail inboxes, blogs, forums, newsgroups and, increasingly, mobile phones, is an industry run by criminals who make money out of it.;
, Avoid filling in questionnaires and pop-ups that appear on the screen. When you do sign up for something, check the small print at the end of the form and refuse permission to be contacted by third parties. This means you are less likely to end up on the spamming lists that are compiled and sold by criminals on the Web.

, Links and attachments in spam messages can infect your computer with hidden programs that steal your personal information, such as passwords and online banking details. Clicking on spam messages, regardless of what they say, invariably brings more spam to your e-mail address. Actually buying something advertised in a spam message is a reckless gamble that nearly always ends as a costly mistake.Since spam is designed to lure you into clicking on something that you shouldn’t, you need to fight the urge to make that click. Ignore all those too-good-to-be-true offers because they are almost guaranteed to be scams. Say no to the promised celebrity pictures and remain aloof from dubious get rich quick schemes. Be highly skeptical of e-mails from people you don’t know, even if they address you by your first name and claim to have seen a video of you on YouTube.

, It also means that you won’t be joining the millions of Internet users around the world whose computers have been turned into zombie botnets – the networks of infected computers remotely controlled by criminals, whose combined computing power is used to create the daily avalanche of spam.Online well being comes from knowing that you can enjoy the benefits and pleasures of the Internet, while your computer remains protected from the constantly evolving security threats. If you have been clicking on spam e-mails and think your computer may be infected, the best way to regain peace of mind is to install professional software like F-Secure’s Internet Security 2009. This will clean up any harmful stuff that may be lurking inside your computer and make sure you stay protected with automatic security updates.With junk mail under control, you can relax and enjoy the time that you’ve wrestled back from the spammers. Whether it’s surfing or strolling, online or offline.

Set up an automatic signature.",How to Close a Business Email," There are a lot of reasons to write an email in a business setting. Pinpointing the primary purpose of the email will help you determine the best way to wrap it up.For example, if you are making a request, end with something like, “Thank you for your time,” or “Thanks for your consideration.”
If you are responding to a request for information or assistance, you could end with “I hope this helps!” or “Let me know if there’s any other way I could be of assistance.”
If you’re setting up a face-to-face meeting, you might end with something like, “See you next week!”;
, Think about how well you know the person you are writing to, what kind of relationship you have with them, and what you are trying to accomplish. An email to an upper-level manager or an important new client should probably be more formal than an email to a well-known co-worker.For example, if you are setting up a meeting with a client, a good closing statement might be something like, “I look forward to our meeting on the 24th. If you have any questions, please contact me at 555-555-5555.”
On the other hand, if you are arranging a friendly meeting with a coworker you know well, it may be perfectly fine to end with something like, “Sounds good! See you tomorrow! :)”

, If this is your first email about the topic at hand, or if it’s a particularly important email, then it’s probably a good idea to include a closing thank you or “call to action.” However, brevity is important in business emails. If your email is part of a long chain, you may not need to include anything beyond the most essential information.For example, if you’re wrapping up a long conversation over email with your boss about an assignment, you may not need to say much more than, “Ok. I will have it done before the end of the day on Friday. –M.”

, If your email is formal, sign off with something like “Best regards,” or (for an even more formal touch) “Sincerely.” For less formal emails, you may be fine using something like “Take care” or “Cheers.”If you’ve had previous emails from the person you’re writing to, you might look at their sign-off and match your tone to theirs. For example, if they tend to sign with something like “Warm regards,” you should sign off with a similar level of formality.

, Like the closing sentence, a sign-off can also reflect the purpose of your email. For example, if you’re making a simple request or briefly expressing gratitude for something, you might use a sign-off like “Many thanks,” or “Thanks so much,” followed by your signature., Unless you know the person you’re writing to very well, avoid anything too slangy, informal, or affectionate. In general, things like “Love,” “XOXO,” or “Hugs” should not be used in business emails., If your email is part of a long chain, or if you’re trying to communicate something very briefly and quickly to a co-worker, it may not be necessary to include a sign-off at all.


If you don’t feel comfortable skipping the sign-off altogether, a simple sign-off like –Bernice or –B. should be just fine for brief, informal emails., How much information you include in your signature will depend on how well you know your correspondent, and how often you have communicated with them.


A first-time email should probably include at least your full name, job title, place of work, and phone number.When communicating with a co-worker or someone you email frequently, it is probably sufficient to sign with your first name or initial., In general, it’s best not to clutter up a business email with a lot of extra text and images. Avoid adding anything unnecessary to your email signature, like quotes, flashy graphics, or a lot of links., If you don’t feel like writing out your job title and contact information every time you send an important email, you may wish to create a signature that your email client can automatically add to your messages.


Some programs, like Outlook, allow you to create multiple signatures, so you can select the one that is most appropriate for any given email.

Indicate why you think she is a good source for your story. Within the email, include your contact information. Do not proceed until you have permission from the interview subject.;
, No interview subject wants to assume what you're asking. Questions should be open-ended and not be yes-or-no questions. If you do choose to utilize a question with a simple yes or no answer, follow up with another question about why the subject answered the way he did.

, Typically, three to five questions is standard for basic email interviews. By limiting the number of questions, you are being considerate of the subject's time. Any more questions than this may be a bit labor-intensive for your source. However, if the source is the main subject of a feature or more lengthy article, more questions might be necessary. Use your best judgment as a journalist.

, There are times that answers to questions cause a journalist to think of additional questions. If this is the case, feel free to follow up for further information.

, If your story is going to appear in a public publication, let the interview subject know when to expect to see the article on news stands.

, This is not to say, however, that it's appropriate to change the context or meaning of the quote to suit your story or its tone.

Point it out to each customer who makes a purchase.Similarly, you can instruct your cashiers to ask each customer who approaches the register for an e-mail address. Make sure that your cashiers tell your customers that providing an e-mail address is only optional while explaining the benefits of doing so.;
, Place a basket, empty fishbowl, or similar container near the register or in another equally visible location. Place a label or sign on it so people will know to drop their business cards inside.


Typically, these types of collections are encouraged by the use of special offers or contests. For instance, you might include a note saying that a random drawing will take place every week, and the winner will receive a certain percentage or dollar amount off his or her next purchase.

, Look for events that would allow you to meet prospective customers for your business. Bring a clipboard sign-up sheet with you to collect e-mail addresses at these events.


Participate in as many trade-shows and fairs as possible. These events attract potential customers, whereas conventions and conferences only tend to attract other business owners in your field.
Depending on the nature of your business, you may also host your own event, like a luncheon, consultation, or show. You can even require attendees to sign up via e-mail for these events.

, When you ship an order to someone, include a separate packing insert in the package that asks customers to sign up for your e-mail newsletter.


Provide clear instructions on signing up. Include the URL to a specific sign-up page or the e-mail address customers can contact if they wish to be added to your subscribers.
Similarly, you can make the request directly on the packing sheet itself. It may not stand out as much as a separate insert would, but it can be a good way to cut costs while still spreading the word.

, Any guide, printed newsletter, printed advertisement, or other printed material produced and/or distributed by your company should include a request for e-mail addresses within the overall content.


The same principle also applies to digital material produced by your company, like videos and podcasts.

, The sign-up form should be very easy to find and located on each page of your website. Make the process as simple and brief as possible to encourage as many subscriptions as possible.The sign-up form might be nothing more than a small, clearly identified box at the top of the website. On the other hand, you might include a link at the top of each page that directs potential subscribers to a separate sign-up page and form. This form should be fairly brief, requiring as little information as possible (name and e-mail address).
If you also have a separate blog for your company, include the form or a link to the form on a highly visible spot of your blog, too.

, Even though most people find pop-up ads annoying, it can actually be a good idea to include a pop-up ad encouraging visitors to sign-up for e-mail content. The key is to format this ad so that it pops up as visitors reach the bottom of the page or leave the website.


Someone who was interested enough in your content to spend time reading it is more likely to provide an e-mail address than someone who just stumbled onto your website for the first time. As such, the pop-up should always come at the end of the visiting experience and never at the beginning.

, Customers who purchase from you online will usually need to provide an e-mail address. Ask for permission to add this e-mail address to your subscribers during the check-out process.


This can usually be accomplished by including a check-box just above the “Submit Order” button. Beside this check-box, include a line like, “Check here to receive special promotions, offers, and news via e-mail.”

, If you aren't already taking advantage of social media to connect to prospective and existing customers, you should start. Post requests for customer e-mail addresses on occasion through each of your social media accounts.


Send text-based tweets on Twitter or post text-based and picture-based statues on Facebook.
Post picture-based advertisements for your e-mail newsletter on Pinterest and Instagram.

, When creating a business signature to automatically paste at the bottom of each e-mail you send, provide instructions on how the receiver of your message can add his or her name to your list of subscribers.


A link can be especially beneficial if you add it to the signature of your company's standard contact e-mail address. Doing so automatically informs anyone who contacts you with questions about your company to learn about your e-mail list.

, Post a screenshot of your e-mail newsletter or similar piece of content somewhere your online visitors can see. This sneak peek should provide a glimpse at some of the content typically included in your newsletter.


Another way to offer a sneak peek would be to archive old editions of past newsletters. This gives potential subscribers a way to look through multiple copies of your newsletter for a more thorough idea of what they will receive by signing up.

, Instead of using text-only advertisements to ask for e-mail addresses, accompany the text with a compelling image. Pictures tend to catch the eye more effectively than text does.


Make sure that the image you use is related to your company in some way. For instance, if you sell garden supplies, the visual could be as simple as a photograph of a beautifully maintained garden.

, Consider offering a free gift to customers who sign up for your e-mail newsletter. The gift should be fairly small yet still worthwhile enough to offer some incentive.


For instance, you might offer a free informative PDF file about a topic that would interest your prospective customers.
On the other hand, the gift could be something like 10 percent off the customer's next purchase, if that purchase is made within the next 30 days.

, Tell customers who sign up for your e-mail newsletter that they will receive a special gift on or around their birthday. As with sign-up gifts, the offer must be affordable for you yet appealing to them.


Free stuff is usually the gift of choice for a birthday club. If you have a storefront, you might e-mail customers a voucher on their birthday that can be traded in person for a small token. Another option is to offer a free gift with a minimal purchase or a significant discount.

, A good way to get a larger volume of new e-mail addresses at one time is to host a giveaway or contest for new subscribers. The winner of your contest should receive a prize, and that prize should be announced ahead of time.Since fewer people will actually win these prizes, they should be worth considerably more than the gift you would give for a birthday club or at sign-up.
You may also offer the chance to earn additional entries for old and new subscribers who advertise your contest via social media, blogs, or other public forums.

, You can post most discounts and offers online for all of your customers to see, but you should also offer the occasional discount that is only available to your e-mail subscribers.


Instruct subscribers to input a certain discount code during the check-out process. Do not post this discount code anywhere on your website, though.

, Getting e-mail subscribers are one thing, but keeping them is another. You need to make sure that the e-mails you send out to your subscribers are worthwhile. Otherwise, they may choose to unsubscribe.


This also means that the messages you do send must all be worthwhile. If you flood your subscribers with three to four e-mails each day, and those e-mails very rarely offer anything of substance, many of your subscribers will choose to delete your messages without reading them.

, Offer incentives to your employees for gathering e-mail addresses.


Offer a bonus or similar monetary incentive to employees who collect a certain number of valid e-mail addresses.
To discourage cheating, make sure that your employees know that these e-mail addresses must be valid and will be verified before the reward is granted.

, Provide incentives to any current customers or subscribers to encourage them to refer friends and family to your e-mail list.


Customers who refer you to others should be made eligible for a special discount.

, If your e-mail newsletter is strong enough to stand as its own incentive, your current subscribers may want to pass it along without any extra encouragement. Include a “forward to a friend” link at the bottom of each newsletter to simplify the process for them.This link should redirect the subscriber to a web-based form. On that form, provide room for the subscriber to enter multiple e-mail addresses and include a short message.
You can also use this trick in conjunction with a customer referral program.

, Work together with other companies and businesses who share a similar clientele. Ask them to advertise your e-mail list, and in return, offer to do the same for them.


You can trade spaces within your newsletters, on your blogs, or on your social media pages. If both businesses send print materials through the mail, you may also send each others' packing inserts.

After a memorable dining experience, for example, write down the name of the restaurant, the dish you ordered, its ingredients and the details of the decor and music. Recording this level of detail will be helpful later on, especially if/when blog followers contact you for more information.

,, The scent of rare flowers, the beautiful view from a mountain top, the feel of soft towels in a high-end hotel, and the sound of a waterfall are examples of descriptions that help people to connect immediately with a place or experience.


Take pictures. To help people see things with their own eyes, take pictures of all locations about which you wish to write. Local cuisines, landmarks, traditional clothing and scenic locations are possible examples. Take numerous photos, posting the clearest and most vivid pictures.
Videotape events. For example, if you are writing about a popular dance festival, include short video clip of dancers next to a description of the event.

, To infuse your travel blog with voices of other travelers, invite freelance writers to submit blog posts about locations you may not have the opportunity to visit. Introduce the writers in a few sentences before posting their entries.

, Blogs typically allow you to accept or disable comments. Allowing comments is an opportunity to build rapport with readers and answer questions.

Open network settings.,
Find the network connection that represents your connection to the internet.,
Select Internet protocol version 4(TCP/IPv4).,
Enter a valid ip address for the computer.,
After entering the IP address check the ""subnet mask"" has been filled in.,
Next fill in the Default Gateway, this is the address of the router or gateway device you are using to access the internet.,
This should tell you the default gateway, fill these numbers into the gateway field.

,
Next you have a choice regarding the DNS information, you can leave it to be obtained automatically (for simplicity).,
Next select ""OK""(optionally select ""validate settings upon exit"" if you think you may have made a mistake or are not confident).

,
Give the pc a second to apply the settings and check you are connected to the internet and can browse it OK.,
You have now statically addressed your computer Well done.

",How to Configure a Static Internet Protocol (IP) Address on a Computer,"


On the local computer go to the control panel.
Locate the network and sharing center icon(name varies depending on operating system). Select the icon.;
, Usually it is called Local Area Connection. Click on that and select Properties.

, Next select Use the following Ip address.

, Make it the first available IP on the network(not the router address, and not .0, or .255. As these are reserved addresses). If you are unsure of what address to use, find out the network address and make the local pc a host on that network.(if you are unsure do not attempt it until you have researched). Usually 192.168.1.1, or 192.168.10.1 will work.

, This identifies which part of the address identifies the host(pc) and which part identifies the network.

, This information can be found by checking your current(unchanged) config.


Go to Run.
Type cmd.
In the terminal window type ipconfig /all


,,


For improved performance try setting it to a service such as ""open DNS"" which offers fast servers, to speed up the url to ip process, this might give faster web browsing(in theory). For this set ""preferred"" to 208.67.222.222 and set ""alternative"" to 208.67.220.220 .

,, NOTE: that the last figure in the IP address you gave this pc, is the unique identifier. If you used 192.168.1.1(for Example!) then the last.1 is unique and cannot be reused whilst used on that pc. For the next Pc set it to 192.168.1.2(Example!) and so on. So each has a unique ID. Be careful not to clash them with each other or the router(or other device) or you will get errors.

Determine your motivation for writing a technology blog.,
Decide what to write about.,
Do research.,
Set a tone for your blog.",How to Write a Technology Blog," This will play an important role in determining which topics you write about and how much depth and background or supporting information you provide.


If you're blogging as a hobby and want to share information you know as well as technical information you're learning regularly yourself, you can choose diverse topics that interest you at a specific time.
If you want to gain a reputation as an expert, you should choose a select number of topics about which you are knowledgeable. You should attempt to provide more information about the topics you choose than most technical bloggers you research online. That may include doing lengthy research before writing. You should focus on in-depth articles and discussions that can be of use to your readers.
If you're blogging to earn money, you should first look into tech companies that offer a good affiliate program, which is a way of earning money based on the amount of people who click through to their websites from yours. Choose companies that offer products or services you feel confident you can blog about, as you will need to refer to them in some form to earn money. This can be done by means of linking phrases in the text of your blog, or posting their ads on your website, which, when clicked, lead to the companies' websites.;
, Plan your topics for the next 3 months ahead of time so you're prepared and have plenty of time to research them. If you're serious about blogging, you might want to have the entire 3 months of content written ahead of time so you can maintain a consistent number of posts while researching and writing more content.


You can find out what topics people are interested in by reading other technical blogs, as well as looking on online forums. In the forums, you'll run across topics that many people want to know more about, which can give you a list of topics for your blog.
Follow the technical news. Watch programs on TV and the web about technology, and read publications about technology to find out what are the most recent developments. News often generates good material to write about and enhance your own knowledge of a subject.
You can write tech product reviews that inform consumers of the quality and use of tech products and services. In some cases, you might even receive discounted or free products from the companies that make or provide the products or services. However, this is most likely to happen when you can prove you have a large number of recurring readers.
Once your blog is up and running, you can always react to some of your readers' suggestions in your blog. For example, if somebody asks for information on a specific topic, you can react to that in 1 or more blog posts (a blog post is an entry in your blog).

, Even if you know a lot about a subject, always make sure to do some quick research to verify what you're writing. If you're writing as an expert, provide more detailed research, as well as sources and links to other pages.

, Blogs are casual, opinionated authored articles and usually don't include a lot of complicated terms and language. Even if you're an expert, try to explain things in terms that a layman will understand.

Blog some more at home after your return if you still find the College Program still making an impact on your life.,
Discuss if you will be signing up for any other internship opportunities on the Disney College Program panel any time soon.",How to Write a Disney College Program Blog," Look for blogging programs or blogging websites that support the use of pictures or images, as well as some formatting changes for bold, italic and/or underlining. You might want to start several weeks before you even apply to the Program.


Look for ways to customize your text as well as add pictures and videos or even link-previews to your text or ways to jazz up that blog without too much extra effort.
A few of the many more commonly-used options include Blogger, LiveJournal, Tumblr, or WordPress.
Make sure that you get maximum exposure: Give readers the ability to comment on your blogs. If readers know more information about how you can make your blog or your program better/easier for you, let them tell you. There are blogs out there that don't offer commenting, or that do but that you can turn off.;
, The further you get into the program, the more consistent you'll have to be and try to blog once a day to get things out. Try to be consistent, so as not to make your reader lose interest while waiting for your new posts. Even when you have other obligations to take care of, try to make blogging part of your regular routine.

, Where were you when you heard about it, and how did it come up in the conversation? Did you do a search for the College Program on the Internet or was it a something else that provoked you into looking for it? Explain how you came to hear about the College Program. Get as descriptive as you can in expressing your thoughts and feelings.

, Was there a question that you really didn't know how to fill out, or was there something unusual that really sparked your curiosity? Without discussing confidential matters, divulge your thoughts about the application.

, Book authors of the Earning Their Ears series (from the Disney Press) of books (tend to talk at length about their web-based interview. If you want to write your own biography as well after finishing, writing this blog posting can help you point out some specifics to mention when you write your memoir. Give your readers an up-close tour of a few of your responses; just be careful not to give out any confidential or sensitive information.

, Where were you when it happened? What were you doing when you received the call? What were some of the questions and what were some of your responses? Explain how you felt answering your College Program recruiter.


Did you connect well with the person who interviewed you? Did they have a program that you would like to have for your own program? Discuss this in as much detail as you can.

, Save some money, because you'll need a bundle of it to enter into the College Program. It can take some time for the Disney College Program to decide if they'd like to bring you on, and so, while waiting, raise a bundle. Make sure you have some money saved, so you can meet the first rent payment. Rent money is due a few days before you get to the area yourself. The average rent payment can cost over $900 (since there are two other fees; some of this may be refundable once you vacate the premises, if you leave it in good condition).

, In Florida, you have three apartment building areas you can choose from. Discuss why you chose the apartment that you chose and the reasoning behind not picking the other three. However, although the California College Program staff only have one real housing area/unit, College Program staff in Florida have some choices. You might have to do extended research online (not just on the Disney College Program recruitment website) to see what each building offers and what the cons to these benefits include to see what you can live with.


Most books about the College Program discuss the three possible choices in Florida and tend to poorly neglect the details of the College Program in California which offers no choices. In Florida, you can choose between Vista Way, Chatham Square, Patterson Court and The Commons, which each have their pros and cons. As for those attending the College Program in California, you'll be living in Carnegie Plaza in Anaheim, CA.Look into Wellness housing if you don't want to live where some people may use alcohol or drugs. You will be mandated by College Program recruiters to live in wellness housing if you are between the ages of 18 and 21., When you share a room with more than one person, your rent will go down. Talk about how you found your room-mates and if you had to do a lot of persuasion to get them to share a room with you and discuss some of the places you searched for roommates for your internship program with Disney. You can use small-talk here to discuss their points of view about the application and program, as long as they haven't told you these details in confidence.


Readers might not know that your dates of arrival and departure and your roommates' arrivals and departures must coincide. However, minor changes may differ if your roommates were termed (terminated) or asked by the staff to leave for good, or if your roommate is one of the International Cast Members who can't work for more than their allotted time (which may be shorter than if they were a US citizen). However, it's best not to mention if these roommates later were termed; instead, if they were, just remove their names from the blog postings you've mentioned them in and move on.
The Disney College Program will only match roommates up by gender. They don't allow mixed-gender roommate situations at the present, without exceptions.

, Try to answer this question as you write: Are you bringing anything that you're attached to, or is this item something with sentimental value? Talk about your reasoning for bringing these pieces with you. If you are choosing to bring other things along which aren't commonplace, consider discussing these choices in your blog.


Although wikiHow has some ideas on what to pack, you may have your own ideas. Disney College Program recruiters say to leave valuable items at home .

, If you took a car, discuss some of the lay-over or pit-stop locations. If you traveled by plane, tell any good stories about your layovers, delays, or other issues. Talk about interactions with the people you met along the way.


Be careful about your readers' (and person's you've met) personal details. If you want to share something personal about anyone you meet, make sure they know you're writing a blog. You might even give them the URL so they can follow you!

, Was it hard to find the bus? Did the bus have to make any other stops before yours? Did you get there super late or super early? If you didn't take the bus, you can omit this step and continue with the remainder of the steps listed here. Discuss talking with other cast members on the bus.


If you have pictures of the bus or talking with other College Program members, post them into the blog posting. You can use an image editing or markup program to blur out the license plate, to help ensure these details aren't a problem for you.
Most College Program students recognize that some students begin blogs devoted to the College Program itself, but you can always explain if they ask. After hearing your explanation, some people may even want to hook up to become friends instead of just fellow cast members!

, After watching a video presentation to welcome you to the College Program, you'll receive your housing authority passes, and room assignments and the like. Look on your acceptance letter to find the time and place you need to arrive to fill out the information for a badge, key and other necessary items, as you'll need to complete the new hire screening on a computer to provide all the information about you that the College Program requires.


Once you get into your room, there should be a book on the table or desk that covers the ins and outs of that particular building. While you can mention things from this book, few readers will want to know most of what's in it. However, read the rules and regulations pages to ensure you follow them, and to know what to expect out of housing staff during your time there.

, Although you might have hooked up with people to find out room assignments in an online location, everyone has different opinions of different people when these meet these other people offline. What were they like when you first met them in person? Is this the first time they have been through the program? If you talked to them about their past experiences on the program, share what they told you.

, Do you have to make any last-minute trips to the store to pick up forgotten items? Make sure that you'll have enough of everything to squeak by for at least the first two weeks of the College Program. Discuss what resources in the area you found helpful, so that future College Program participants might find the same helpful stores. If there's something you didn't anticipate needing, you can share that, too, so that readers will learn from your mistakes.


In Florida, there is a Walmart Supercenter near housing, as well as a Super Target and Publix at Vineland Ave in Orlando. There's also a Publix at Vineland Rd in Kissimmee which is a short distance from the apartment complex.
For those on the California Program, there are supermarkets also nearby, from a Vons less than a block away, to a local supermarket about five minutes by car, to several blocks down S Harbor Blvd to the local Walmart.However, many tourists shop there, too, so be prepared for some interesting visits!
Get gas if you have brought a car to the program. Be careful not to get gas at the gas station near Vista Way in Florida, as it is the most expensive station in the area. There are Wawa convenience stores and Racetrack convenience stores nearby that are cheaper. For those on the California program, you can get gas across the street at the Arco or Alliance gas stations nearby. If you want a little more of a trek due to gas prices, try the 76 gas station about five to ten minutes away on S Harbor Blvd., Was it hard to find your bus? Did the bus have to make any other stops before yours? Did you get there super late or super early?


If you had brought a car, discuss the traveling you did to get there. Was there something about your trip (such as did you hook up to rideshare with co-participants to get there) that you can comment on? Certainly, you might find a story or two to tell, even early on.
Discuss talking with other cast members on the bus. If you have pictures of the bus or talking with other College Program members, post them into the blog posting. Most College Program participants do recognize that some students begin blogs devoted to their programs itself, but be prepared to talk about your reasons if they ask you about it.

, The Traditions course is rather easy, but you do have to sign the non-disclosure agreement that says that you can't mention insider (internal and confidential-only) information about the company (including park attendance, trade secrets and non-public policies, as well as how an attraction is run and the like). Don't post these types of details on your blog or you may end up being termed (terminated/fired) from your Program, as well as having to remove these details from the blog. Protect company assets and preserve the magic for the guest to experience when they visit the area.


However, you can safely explain in your blog some of the safer details, such as who you sat with in meeting rooms and talked to in hallways or mentioning some of the special guests including some of the Disney character names (but without divulging who's behind the mask) or who attended the class or who the trainer was. Course details, however, are off-limits to the public.

, You'll be given your work assignment as soon as you pass the Traditions course. Disney has many assignments for College Program Cast Members, including assignments in their Operations, Entertainment, Lodging, Food & Beverage, Retail/Sales or Recreationlocations. However, there are other jobs in each of these areas which you may be asked to help out with depending on your major, preferences, and a few other factors.


Try to describe as best you can where you'll be working. Which building in which park will you be working in? Which type of role will you be in? Describe your job title. Is it retail or is it something as simple as watching a parking lot or helping with moving people between places in a line? You can mention this title straight from the paper you received with the name of the job on it - including the suffix numbers of the assignment. Although your first program assignment will probably not be acting as a character themselves, you can discuss this later in your blog, if and when you chose to audition for a character position.

, Although it's against policy to take pictures inside the Costume Shop or mention the exact aisle/row location where your costume was found, if you want to add in a picture of you in your costume, you may be able to take a picture of yourself in it at your apartment complex.


If there was no costume available that day, remember to grab your exemption paper coupon that will exempt you from the scrutiny until the costume arrives which could be a day or so and which must be handed to your area manager upon your next workday - and wait out the time period on your blog until you receive your costume.
If you aren't allowed to take a picture and aren't able to take your costume back to your apartment complex, write and publish the text of the post then take your picture when you are inside the parks with the costume on. Upload it to your blog once you arrive back to your complex and are away from the parks. Don't take any pictures inside of the Utilidor tunnel system under the Magic Kingdom. It's fair game in any other area of any of the other Disney Parks including Epcot, Disney Studios, Animal Kingdom, Disneyland or Disney's California Adventure parks.

, With each day being updates to the others, these serve an integral role in your blog towards the beginning. You can discuss who your trainer is and what you generally do in the job, but be careful of what details you mention.These posts are crucial to any person who decides they'd like to later send in their story for their Earning their Ears Book to the Disney Press, or the reader who wants to learn about the insides more of your internship but can't get a job from Disney.


During Day 1, you'll be in the Traditions class at Disney University as was discussed previously. Traditions generally lasts less than 8 hours and by the end of the day, you'll receive your training schedule, name pin and cast ID card.
During Day 2, you'll have a half day of in-class training, as well as a half-day tour of the area where you'll be working. You'll get to know some areas you'll need to be familiar with when guests enter the park. You won't be able to ride any rides during the tour, but you can when you aren't on Disney's clock.
Day 3 generally is your area training day. You'll be doing some walking, and taking an eLearning class (for some business lines).
During Day 4, you'll be meeting with your locations management team and receiving details of what will be expected of you on the job as well as a safety briefing. However, these details will differ depending on your line of business.

During your College Program stay with Disney, you'll be trained in many different areas, as well as cross-trained if needed. Even those who walk around carrying glow items will have training including ""Glow and Apron Cash Handling"" training.


During Day 5 and subsequent days, you can explain some of the guest interactions you'll be starting to have as well as obtaining your ""Earning My Ears"" sticker on your name tag. Every single cast member who has ever worked at the Parks has received this sticker on their name tag.

, Make a mental note of what happened before blogging about it later that evening. Be somewhat discrete if you interacted with a VIP; don't go into detail about what happened (You can mention ""I met up with (x person today)"" but let your readers know that you can't elaborate due to confidentiality matters. Your readers will need to respect your wishes). Write about the ""magical moments"" you experience on one-on-one with guests. Share any funny stories about your interactions. If you ever get called to pick up a Guest Satisfaction card in the park from a guest you've helped, this evaluation is a great thing to post on your blog - even if this means posting a scanned image of the card on the blog for all your blog readers to see. These types of postings are great morale boosters when you are feeling down or are beginning to feel homesick.


Try to blog at least once a day with something you said or did to help a guest. Regular blogging will help keep your readers engaged, but watch your statistics page/chart if possible. Some readers will wander away from a blog if you post too often, overload them with too many details, or not post enough.

, Although some schools require additional classes to be taught to receive college credits for this program, not all colleges require it. Were there other classes you had to take or was there anything unexpected about how the Disney system works with the College Program? Not all bloggers go into these details, but your experiences might help other potential Disney College Program attendees and trying to discuss your choices and why you didn't pick the others as you given the sheet might help other attendees of the alternate classes choose more wisely.


Although not required by all colleges to get college credit for the College Program, some colleges want you to do some actual bookwork. These extra classes prove that you are learning new knowledge about the company and applying it to your field of study.

, Most bloggers choose to publish a picture of themselves in their College Program ear hats with their certificates of completion. What did you wear? When and where did this take place? When were you able to attend (if you couldn't stay for the entire event)? What was the party like? Did you have problems taking the time off or was your boss accommodating? Did you make any new friends and contacts? How did you feel about the graduation (did you feel sad or did you feel angry or did you just want to get out of the Program already)?


Watch out for the date, time, location and dress code of the Graduation Ceremony. It's an emotional and fun event for most College Program students, but it does happen off the clock. Communicate with your management team to let them know you'd like the time off for it, and most locations will ask that you attend when you are off the clock for that day or to work around your schedule - having to stop by before your shift or shortly after your shift - all to accommodate your schedule.

, Talk about how you felt, and how it felt when packing up and saying goodbye to your roommates. At this stage, you probably don't need to detail the move-out as much as you did with your move-in, but there could be some experience you may want to share are still some experiences you may want to share. How did you feel different this time around?

, Was it hard to find the bus? Did the bus have to make any other stops before yours? Did you get to the airport super late or super early? If you didn't take the bus, you can omit this step and continue with the remainder of the steps listed here. Discuss talking with other former cast members on the bus.

If you have pictures of the bus or talking with other College Program members, post them into the blog posting. You can use image editing software to hide the license plate, if you choose to take a picture of the back or front of the bus.
Most College Program students recognize that some students begin blogs devoted to the College Program itself, but you can always explain if they ask. After hearing your explanation, some people may even want to hook up to become friends instead of just fellow cast members!

, If you took a car, discuss some of the lay-over or pit-stop locations. If you traveled by plane, tell any good stories about your layovers, delays, or other issues. Talk about interactions with the people you met along the way.


Be careful about personal details. If you want to share something personal about anyone you meet, make sure they know you're writing a blog. You might even give them the URL so they can follow you!

, Maybe you met someone on the way home who wanted to hear all about your College Program internship, or maybe you had trouble adjusting to your regular schedule at home again. Maybe you tried giving your neighbors a Disney guest greeting or used the special DisneyPoint methods of pointing to something when you could have used regular pointing or descriptions of the objects (any Disney College Program participant will tell you that this is generally the last to leave if it ever leaves your body after it's learned)! Let your readers know how your College Program affected you in the long-run (even in funny and silly ways). It's a positive experience worth reflecting on.

, While some Disney College Program members say ""Yeah, I'll take the plunge to tackle another semester"", talk about the transition and seeing if you've chosen to take on an additional semester (if it is allowed by your college when you are still in college). Even if you tell your college that you'd like to tackle the opposite program (Disneyland version instead of Walt Disney World's version or vice-versa), discuss your thoughts on being a Cast Member again, if you chose to.


You may have to review info for those who were on the Disneyland program to ensure you have what it takes for this program.
Don't forget to update your resume before you apply for the opposite program. Make sure to not forget to mention the courses you took as well as a brief description of the items you tackled while on your original program.

, The configuration page is usually reachable by completing the router's installation. If you don't see an option marked Configure, Properties, or something similar, consult the router's manual.

,,, This should uncheck it.

, Unchecking this box and the one before it will allow your load-balancing router to distribute your connected Wi-Fi networks in one single connection.,, This process will vary based on the router you purchased, but you should be able to do so by selecting your router's name from your computer's connection manager and entering the router's password (it should be on a sticker located beneath or on the back of your router).

, If you've completed your load-bearing router setup and connected your computer to the router, you should notice a difference in your browsing speed!

Open a new document and use File → Save As in the top menu to save it as a ""Web Page,"" or to change the file extension to "".html"" instead of "".doc,"" "".rtf,"" or any other extension.


You may see a warning that your document will be changed to ""plain text"" instead of ""rich text,"" or that special formatting and images won't be saved properly. This is fine; HTML documents do not use those options.

, Save your blank document, then find the document icon in your computer and double click to open it. It should open as a blank web page in your browser. If it doesn't, drag the file icon to the URL (address) bar of your browser. As you edit your HTML document in this tutorial, you can keep checking back and seeing how your web page changes.


Note that this does not actually create a website online. It will not be accessible by other people, and you do not need an internet connection to test out. This just uses a browser to ""read"" your HTML document as though it were a website.

, Markup tags do not show up on a web page like normal text. Instead, they tell your web browser how to display the page and its content. The ""start tag"" contains instructions. For example, it might tell the browser to display text as bold. You also need an ""end tag"" to let the browser know where the instructions apply: in this example, all text between the start tag and the end tag will be bold. Write end tags inside angle brackets as well, but start with a slash after the first bracket.


Write start tags in between angle brackets: <start tag goes here>

Write end tags in between angle brackets, but put a slash after the first bracket: </end tag goes here>)
Keep reading to learn how to write functional markup tags. For this step, all you need to remember is the basic format they are written in: < > and </ >
If you are using other HTML tutorials as well, you might see them refer to the tags as ""elements"" and the text in between start and end tags as ""element content.""

, Every html document starts with a <html> tag and ends with a </html> tag. This tells the browser that everything between these tags is in HTML. Add these tags to your document:


Often, HTML files are started with a <!DOCTYPE html> line that indicates that the file as a whole should be read as a HTML file by browsers. It isn't needed, but may help resolve compatibility issues.
Write <html> at the top of your document.
Hit enter or return several times to give yourself some space, then write </html>

Remember to write everything else in this tutorial in between these two tags.

, In between the <html> and </html> tags, write a <head> start tag and a </head> end tag. Give yourself space to write between them. Everything in between these head tags won't actually be displayed on the page itself. Try the following and see where it shows up instead:


In between the <head> and </head> tags, write <title> and </title>

In between the <title> and </title> tags, write How to Learn HTML - wikiHow.
Save the document and open it in a browser (or save the document, then refresh the browser page if it's already open.) Do you see what you wrote at the top of the browser, above the address bar?

, Everything else in this beginner document will go in a body section, which actually gets displayed on the web page. After the </head> end tag, but before the </html> tag, write <body> and </body>. For the rest of this tutorial, everything you write will go in between these body tags. You should now have a document that looks like this (ignoring the bullet points):


<html>
<head>
<title>How to Learn HTML - wikiHow</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

, Now it's time to write something you can actually see in your browser! Anything you write within the body tags will show up in your browser after you save the HTML document and refresh the browser page. Don't write anything with the < or > symbols, however, since your browser will try to interpret it as an HTML instruction instead of normal text. Try writing Hello world! (or anything else you like), then add these new tags around it and see what happens each time:



<em>Hello world!</em> will show up as ""emphasized text:"" Hello world!


<strong>Hello world!</strong> will show up as ""strong text:"" Hello world!


<s>Hello world!</s> will show up with a strikethrough: Hello world!


<sup>Hello world!</sup> will show up as superscript: Hello world!


<sub>Hello world!</sub> will show up as subscript: Hello world!

Try combinations of these: What does <em><strong>Hello world!</strong></em> look like?

, If you try to write several lines of text in your HTML document, you might notice that the line breaks don't show up in your browser. You have to code these in yourself:


<p>This is a separate paragraph.</p>

This sentence is followed by a line break.<br>before this sentence begins.
This is the first tag you've seen that doesn't need an end tag! These are called ""empty tags.""

Make headings to display the names of sections:<h1>header text</h1>: the largest header<h2>header text</h2> (the 2nd level header)<h3>header text</h3> (the 3rd level header)<h4>header text</h4> (the 4th level header)<h5>header text</h5> (the smallest header)

, There are several different ways to write lists on your webpage. Try out the following types of code and see which one you like. Note that one pair of tags goes around the whole list (such as the <ul> and </ul> tags for ""unordered list""), while individual items on the list are surrounded by another pair of tags, such as <li>and</li>.


Use this code to make bulleted lists:<ul><li>One item</li><li>Another item</li><li>Another item</li></ul>

Or this code to make numbered lists:<ol><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li><li>Item 3</li></ol>

Or this code to make a list defining terms:<dl><dt>Coffee</dt><dd>- Hot Beverage</dd><dt>Leite</dt><dd>- Cold Beverage</dd></dl>


, Now it's time to try adding things besides text to your page. Try out the following tags, or click the links for more information. You'll need to use an online image hosting service so you have a URL to link to in the image tag:



Insert a Line in HTML: <br> or <hr>


Add images: <img src=""your_image_url"">


, You can also use this code to link to other pages and websites, but for now, since you may not have a web site yet, we'll focus on ""anchors,"" or specific places on the page that you can link to:


First make an anchor with the <a> tag at the point on the page that you want to link to. Name it something descriptive and easy to remember.:<a name=""Tips"">This is the text you put the anchor around.</a>

Use the <href> to link to those anchors or to another webpage:<a href=""url of webpage, or name of anchor within this page"">Write the text or image that will be displayed as a link here.</a>

To link to an anchor on a different web page, add the # sign after the URL, followed by the name of the anchor. For instance, https://www.wikihow.com/Learn-HTML#Tips links to the Tips section of this page.

, Attributes are placed within the tag itself, making additional alterations to the ""element content"" between the start and end tag. They never stand alone. They are written in the format name=""value"", where name is the name of the attribute (for instance ""color""), and value describes this specific instance (for instance ""red"").


You've actually seen attributes before, if you followed the tutorial in the basic HTML section. <img> tags use the src attribute, anchors use the name attribute, and links use the href attribute. See how those all follow the ___=""___"" format?

, Making a table, or chart, requires several different tags. Play with these tags, or learn about HTML tables in more detail.


Start with table tags around the entire table:<table></table>

Row tags around the contents of each row: <tr>

Column headers in the first row: <th>

Cells in subsequent rows: <td>

Here's an example of how it all fits together:<table><tr><th>Column 1: Month</th><th>Column 2: Money Saved</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>$100</td></tr></table>


, You've already learned the <head> tag, which shows up at the start of each document. Besides the <title> tag, it can include the following types of tags:



Meta tags, which are used to provide metadata about a web page. This data can be used by search engines when the robot scours the internet to locate and list websites. To make your website more visible on search engines, use one or more <meta> start tags (no end tags necessary), each with exactly one name attribute and one content attribute, for example: <meta name=""description"" content=""write a description here"">; or <meta name=""keywords"" content=""write a list of keywords, each separated by a comma"">
<link> tags are used to associate other files with the page. This is mainly used to link to CSS stylesheets, which are made using a different type of coding to alter your HTML page by adding color, aligning your text, and many other things.
<script> tags are used to link the page to JavaScript files, which can cause the page to change as the user interacts with it.

, A great way to expand your knowledge is by looking into the HTML source of webpages. You can do this by right clicking the page and selecting ""View Source,"" ""View Page Source,"" or a similar option, or by going to the View section in the top menu of your browser. Try to figure out what each unfamiliar HTML tag does, or look it up online for the answer.


While you cannot edit other people's web sites, you can copy the HTML you find into your own document, then play with it to see what different options do. Note that, without the CSS stylesheet that website links to, you may not be able to see all of the colors or formatting.

, There are various resources on the internet that you can use to learn about many more HTML tags, such as W3Schools or Codecademy. You may also find books with tutorials about HTML, but make sure you use one that was published within the last couple years, since there are occasional updates and changes. Better yet, learn CSS to have much more control over your web page's layout and appearance. Once you have CSS down, the next step for web designers is typically Javascript.

You will need to set these filters on each computer that you install the software on.






Filters are updated constantly by the companies that run these programs. Many use automated systems that browse new pages and block automatically, even if the site isn’t in the database yet.







, Some programs will allow you to set specific times that content can be accessed. For example, you could disable all access to social networks during homework hours so that children can’t be wasting time on Facebook instead of studying.

Appreciate the varying degrees of ""going viral"".,
Understand the limits of going viral.,

Have an abundance mentality.,
Make sure people can find your content.,
Publicize yourself.,
Don't overdo your content promotion.,
Create momentum and incite action.,
Watch your timing.,
Leave room for connection.",How to Improve Your Chances of Going Viral," Your website content, photos, or a video you've created can ""go viral"", your marketing can turn viral (""viral marketing""), and in the case of social media, a blog, a Facebook page or group, or a tweet can turn viral. In fact, any sort of content you create that is shared via phones, iPads, computers, or other electronic means can be viral, be it an app, game, puzzle, or a story, so don't limit your idea of what can go viral to thinking about dancing baby videos or million pixel websites! The next great viral thing is... unknown!


Viral could mean within your interest niche, such as just among photography buffs, cooking fans, Star Wars collectors, or whatever, or it could go beyond your niche into the stratosphere of being enjoyed and shared around by everyone, just because there is something within your content that resonates with a wide group of people, such as a human interest element, a problem solved, a health scare, a video or story of a cute kid or pet, etc.;
, It's a good idea to get this straight before getting too excited – you cannot make your content go viral. You can hope for it, you can position your content to be at its best and most interesting with the underlying wish that it will catch on, but you cannot make it go viral. At the most, as Ann Handley and C.C. Chapman explain in their book Content Rules, you can ""nudge, poke, and pray for it ... the truth is that viral is largely a happy accident.""So, don't try to control the viral nature of your content; instead, concentrate fully on making it compelling, at the top of its niche, interesting, funny, moving, and definitely something able to resonate with a lot of readers or viewers. Accept that it will be your audience who makes the ultimate decision on the content's ""viral worthiness"".

, One of the key things behind something going viral is that it touches people in some way. And what is most likely to touch a bunch of people who are tech-savvy, clued in, and ready for new information all of the time? Unsurprisingly, it's the same as it has always been – things that are uplifting and make us feel good about ourselves and others. What is most likely to ""flow"" – that is, get sent around the social media networks – is content of the following nature:Content that inspires awe. Think of ""Christian the Lion"".Can you still get over the fact that two guys could even buy a lion cub in a large department store in the middle of one of the world's biggest cities (Harrods) once upon a time, and that that lion could then frolic in local London gardens before being shipped to Africa and still recognize his original owners years later? That sort of awe-inspiring tale gives us all a sense of how amazing this world is and how we can all play intricate, valuable roles in life.
Content that triggers an emotional response.

Positive articles, positive, uplifting messages. Articles able to open the mind and broaden knowledge through positive messages are particularly enjoyed.
Articles that make us feel good about ourselves and others. One viral event that created a real feel good sense was the video ""Validation"",in which people saw the good that comes of validating other people. Articles that that create a sense of admiration and surpassing of mere self interest tend to be the most shared, showing that we do care a great deal about others and we're moved by stories of others who are actively doing something to show this.
Longer articles over short. Believe it or not, people will spend time reading thoroughly when the content merits it, and when it carries a clear message that they're yearning to learn more about. Just be sure that longer means ""more engaging"" and not ""long-winded and repetitive""!

Quirky topics, especially the ""unexpected"". Things that are out-of-the-ordinary, very unusual, and extremely interesting.
Cute things. Laughing babies, crazy cats, dogs doing tricks, etc. – we've all watched or seen such content and loved it.

, Some examples of information that helps others improve their lives, understand things better, or make timely decisions include:



How Tos and instructional content

News, especially breaking news
Warnings (like a phishing scam or viruses online)

Freebies and contests.

, Information used to be something carefully protected and meted out to the masses. These days, it's about sharing information as much as possible, although not just any information but useful, quality, informative, and even detailed information that people really need or want to make their lives better. The person, company, or group most willing to provide quality information to others that shares or solves something and doesn't involve a secret agenda (such as sales or demands) is most likely to get respected followings, which enhances the chances of turning viral.However, be wary of how you promote this vast amount of productivity; see below for avoiding overdoing the promotion.

, Content that's buried and difficult to access won't go viral for the simple fact that nobody can find it. Start with your domain or host; if you have your own domain, is it an easy-to-remember name or one that requires the memory of an elephant to get right? If you're using another site to host your content, be sure to use one that has a good following, such as Flickr, YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook, etc. And be sure that your content includes the very thing people would be looking for, such as a turn of phrase, a precise question, specific keywords, etc.


Search for your content using a search engine or two. Is it coming back to you easily or are you having to dig through page after page of returns before it shows up?
Use social media as another string to your bow. Active Facebook and Twitter accounts are the place to leave information about freshly uploaded content and to encourage the information to be shared around widely.
Provide easy search and categorization within your content so that people can find things quickly if they do want to look through more than one piece of content. Moreover, search engines love categories.
Tag and keyword everything you can. Search engines can find the content better this way.

, While it isn't possible to create a viral outcome, it is possible to encourage the potential for it. Publicizing your content through trusted channels is an important way to get your content seen, noticed, and possible picked up on by many others. In other words, make it very easy for people to notice that your content is there.


Put your content on more than one site. Use Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, RSS feeds, microblogging sites, and even links via profile pages you have on various websites and your email signatures. Get onto forums, into IRCs, and anywhere else you usually frequent and casually mention your masterpiece and suggest that people might check it out.
Use a link. The majority of retweets have links in them. When it comes to viral videos and webpages, the link is a crucial part of it.
Send a link to your content to everyone you know such as friends, family, and co-workers, provided it's not likely to be a nuisance to them.

, Be very selective about what you encourage your readers and viewers to check out. You don't want to convince them that every single piece of content you produce is the next latest greatest thing or they'll start viewing you as the ""boy who cried wolf"" and stop even looking at your work. Be astute about what is the very best of your output and only put that forward as worthy of getting shared around. That way, you increase the chances of going viral because it's both quality content and not about over-pressuring your initial content sharers.

, Not only should you publicize yourself but you need to also help your viewers and readers do something with your content; it isn't enough to simply put the content out and sit about hoping something will eventuate. Plant the suggestion for them and allow them to be the arbiter of whether or not they'll follow through. For example, if you want to be retweeted, just ask. And be sure to try that six letter word, 'please'. A higher percentage of retweets are found to contain the word ""please"" than not! Some ways to provide a call to action include (and the more of these you can do, the better):


Providing clear social sharing icons, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Reader, etc. These icons are fondly known as ""social bling"" and since they increase the ease with which people can pass around your content, make the most of them.
Tell people what you're hoping to happen with the content by gently steering them with kind and thoughtful requests. Some of the ways to do this include saying such phrases as:

Check out… (my link, my eBook, my post, my video, my article, etc.)
Please embed my video/interactive quiz… (and make it easy for this to happen)
Follow this person
Download my widget/game/PowerPoint/eNook!
Please vote!
Help me...

Questions, e.g. “What do you think of…?"", and so forth.


Invite people to come and interact with you, your content, or something you've created around the content. Perhaps a webinar, or a Skype call, or a Twitter party. Be open to all the possibilities to enlighten people as to the potential for your content.

, As with most things in life, timing is everything and you need to have a sense of whether or not the time is right for the content you're hoping to go viral. If it's not, patience might be a virtue until the right moment appears but if it is, then don't waste a moment in case someone else gets there ahead of you. Only you will be able to gauge the issue of timing as it will be very attuned to your topic and interests and is something you will need to monitor the pulse of yourself.


In terms of timing the posting itself, this is a related but slightly different issue. Be sure to post at what you know is the most active time of being online for your target audience. The more people who are actively reading, viewing, or interacting with your content at the same time when it's released, the greater are your chances of the content getting sent around amid the buzz of novelty and mutually sustaining sharing.

, Ultimately it is the ability for conversation to take place that helps many a piece of web content to turn viral. Make sure it's easy for people to contact you if they want to know more, either through comment boxes, IM, a chat forum, an email, or any other way you're used to using. And be responsive, not reclusive!


Ratings systems can be helpful too, as can numbers of visitors. These do influence readers and viewers who can see what others are thinking about the content and how many other people are getting involved.

Some popular ways are streaming gameplay online or making unique content in the form of videos or writing. Other famous internet stars are popular on social media. Think of things that you like doing and create a strategy based on your skills.

If you can’t think of anything that you’re good at, then think of something that interests you and that you’d like to learn more about.
If you know a lot of different makeup techniques, you can create video content showing others how to apply makeup.
If you are excellent at games then you can stream or create videos on YouTube to gain a fanbase.
If you already spend a lot of time on social media, you should consider actively growing your social media followers to become famous.
If you think you have an interesting life you can create vlogs that people can follow.
If you have an immense knowledge in a specific topic you can start a blog or create videos online to educate other people.;
, Another way to get inspired is by emulating someone that you look up to. If you don't follow any internet celebrities, start searching for them online to get a better idea of what you need to do to become famous. Look on websites like Twitch.tv, YouTube, and online blogs to find celebrities. If you are already a fan of an internet celebrity and you watch their content regularly, it’s likely you have a decent knowledge about what they do.


Popular internet personalities include PewDiePie, The Jester, Nash Grier, Joy Cho, and Grace Helbig., Communities are made up of a variety of people who share the same interests and often share ideas and thoughts to one another. Some people in the community make online content and become famous off that content. Doing research on other content creators or famous people will give you an understanding of the competition as well as the potential fanbase that you’ll have. Also, within communities are sub-communities or niche communities that concentrate on more concentrated subject matter. Search for other content creator's social media profiles or any video or written content that they create.

Places where you can find online communities include the Playstation Community, Being Girl, Figment, Harley Owners Group, and Lugnet.Some popular gaming communities include the DOTA 2 community, the CSGO community, the League of Legends community, the FIFA community, and the Fighting Game community.
Some of the most successful people to come out of the gaming community include Park 'Lyn' Joon, Henrik 'AdmiralBulldog' Ahnberg, Jonathan 'Loda' Berg, Johnathan 'Fatal1ty' Wendell.Some of the most notable YouTubers include PewDiePie, Smosh, the Fine Brothers, and Lindsey Stirling.
You can also get information on the community by visiting the community’s subreddit on Reddit.com.
If the content you plan on pursuing already has a lot of up-and-coming content producers or established stars, you may want to choose something else unless you bring something exciting and unique.

, Now that you’ve done your research, you can narrow down all your choices. Think of your goals and decide if they are realistic. Write down all of the things that you’d consider doing and weigh the positives and the negatives. Once you’ve narrowed it down, choose something to pursue and start creating a strategy.

Estimate the probability of success within the community by evaluating your competition, the overall viewer base, and the popularity of your content platform.

, Try to get the same username across your social media platforms so that people don’t get confused. Use your logo or profile picture and make them the same to create brand recognition for yourself. You also need to stay consistent on what you say and the type of person you are. If you say something but do the opposite, regularly break your word, or act hypocritical, the internet may turn on you and fans may leave you.If you have a logo or profile picture that you use regularly, make sure that the brand is represented across the different social media platforms.
Think of your brand like a company. If a company has different logos and store layouts, it may become confusing to consumers. The same can be said about your fans.
Regardless if you are angry, mean, happy, or silly, fans will be confused if your personality changes overnight or you do things that don’t seem consistent.

, Choose two social media platforms that you can update regularly. This will give your fans access to you even when you aren’t creating new content. When trying to decide on which platforms to create, consider the age of your target audience as well as what platforms they are most likely to use. Cross promote on your different platforms and always give people an easy way to follow you somewhere else.


If you are trying to appeal to a younger audience, platforms like Twitter and Instagram are the best.
If you are trying to appeal to an older audience, platforms like Facebook, Pinterest, and LinkedIn are ideal., Having a website will allow people to search you and find the different social media platforms your on as well as get direct access to your content. A website will also give promoters and advertisers an easy way to contact you. Lastly, a personal blog can also serve as another revenue stream if you decide to advertise or use affiliate links or promotions that lead to purchases for different product manufacturers.


Make sure to create a responsive website that works on phones and different browsers.
If you specialize in video, you can create vlogs instead of writing in a blog.
Popular blog and website creation sites include Wordpress.org, Wordpress.com, Squarespace, and Wix.

Wordpress.org requires more technical knowledge to set up and shouldn't be undertaken by someone with no knowledge of programming languages like PHP and CSS.



, Hashtags and memes are both ways that you can reach a larger audience and create new fans. Find hashtags that apply to what you’re doing and use them creatively in posts to find fans that share the same interests. Encourage followers or fans to follow a specific hashtag and grow your follower base through social media. Jump on popular memes and share funny content that you find online. Engage with the online community that follows you.

Share memes that are relevant to what's going on currently in the news.
Popular memes include doge, forever alone, Good Guy Greg, Neil deGrasse Tyson's reaction, and overly attached girlfriend.For example, if you have a vlog about food, you might want to use the hashtags #food, #foodie, or #foodporn., One of the best ways to get more of a following is to be one of the first people in a certain genre of whatever you are doing. Find a niche like a smaller social group, game, or topic that doesn’t have a lot of big stars. Luckily, because the internet has a ton of different groups and communities, there are a lot of choices that you can pursue.For instance, reviewers that review popular movies on YouTube is an oversaturated area and you’re likely to find a lot of competition in the space.
In addition to finding a niche for what you do, you can find a niche for who you are.
Famous internet stars often represent an underrepresented group of people in society.

, Online fans like it when people act genuinely in the content that they create. Being genuine helps keep your brand consistent and gives fans an idea of what to expect from you in the future. If you diverge too much from who you are and fans see it as negative, you may jeopardize your career being an online celebrity., If you aren’t used to using social media regularly, you can create a daily schedule to remind yourself to make posts and check your social media platforms.Doing this on a regular basis will show your fans that you're active and give them a reason to keep visiting your page. Make sure that you engage with your fans and only share quality content that you find online.If you post regularly you'll show up on some fan's feeds.
Try to stay consistent with your content schedule as well. If fans are used to getting content every two days and then you take a week hiatus, some of your growth may be stifled.

, While you don’t want to alter who you are as a person, there are things that you can do to appeal to your fans. Emphasize your content on things that you think your fans would like to see. If you know that the majority of your fans don't like something, don't create content involving it. If there are things that your fans are always asking you to do, consider satisfying them.

Reply to people on social media and read comments on your posts.

, If you see a huge dip in followers or a particular video or article gets negative attention you know that it’s not good to continue doing the same things for your career. When you see a random drop in viewers or positive comments, take your time to re-evaluate what you are doing and internalize the criticism that others are giving you. Alter your image and routine to maximize your fan count.

If you come out with a really controversial video or article, create another video to elaborate what you meant or to apologize for your actions.

, Try to create the highest quality content you possibly can. Even if you don’t have the hardware, make sure that the quality of your content is worthwhile. Posting things that are irrelevant to people or things that haven’t been thought out could leave you with a cheap looking product and may cause fans to unsubscribe or unfollow you.If you want to create videos, it's better to wait until you can shoot them in HD rather than coming out with a sub-par product.

, What many people don’t understand is that being a famous online celebrity takes as much time as a full-time job for many people. If you are producing or creating unique content, you may not see an initial reward for all the hard work you’re putting forth. It’s important to continue to keep staying consistent and to take advice and criticism from those around you. In order to stand apart from other Internet personalities, you’ll need to have something unique and marketable."

Sign up for OpenDNS.,
Open your router’s configuration page.,
Find your DNS settings.,
Enter your DNS information.,
Click Apply Changes or Save.,
Enable dynamic IP updates.,
Set your filters.,
Monitor which sites are accessed.",How to Block Websites2," OpenDNS is free for use at home, and a more powerful version is available to businesses for a fee. OpenDNS is installed into your network’s router, and affects all network traffic. This means that it blocks websites on any device connected to the router, including computers, tablets, game consoles, and mobile phones.


OpenDNS will block sites on every device, so it may not be as useful for parents who want to access blocked sites when the children aren't around.

, Most routers can be accessed by entering 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 into a web browser’s address bar on a device that is connected to the network. You may then be asked to enter your username and password.


Your router’s login address and default username/password combination will vary by manufacturer. If you cannot access your router, try checking the default settings at RouterPasswords.com.






If you still cannot access your router due to a forgotten username or password, you can press the reset button on the router to reset it to the factory settings. This will erase all of your network settings, including wireless settings.

, This is typically located in the Internet section of the router. Look for DNS accompanied by two or three fields where you can enter IP addresses. For most default settings there will be two options, though the exact wording may change: “Get Automatically from ISP” and “Use These DNS Servers”. Select “Use These DNS Servers” so that you can input the OpenDNS server information.

, In the Primary and Secondary DNS fields, enter the following addresses:


208.67.222.222
208.67.220.220

, Once the settings have been updated, you will want to flush the DNS on each computer connected to the network. This will ensure that your new settings will take effect immediately.

, Chances are your home internet connection has been assigned a dynamic IP by your internet service provider. This means your home IP address will occasionally change. OpenDNS needs to be configured to update its settings when your IP address changes, otherwise the filtering will not work.

Log in to your OpenDNS Dashboard using the username and password you received when you signed up.






Select your network in the Home or Settings tab. Click Advanced Settings and scroll to the Dynamic IP Update section. Check the boxed labeled Enable and then click Apply to save your settings.






Download an OpenDNS Dynamic IP Updater program. This program should be installed on a computer that your children will not have access to so that it cannot be disabled. Ideally this computer will be always on, or on before other computers connect.







, Once you have OpenDNS configured, you’re ready to start setting your filters. These filters will block sites that meet certain criteria, such as pornography, academic fraud, social media, and many more. You can either filter out categories, set overall tiers of protection, block specific websites, or only allow specific websites.

Log in to your OpenDNS Dashboard. Select the network that you want to adjust the filtering for. Click on the Web Content Filtering link.






Choose your filter level. You can choose between three tiers of filtering: Low, Moderate, and High. OpenDNS will provide examples of what gets filtered at each level.






Set a custom filter. If you’d like to define which filters you would like to activate, click the Custom option and then check each box that you want to enable. For example, checking






Add domains to your black- or whitelist. In the “manage individual domains” section, you can enter in domains that you want to either be always blocked or always allowed, regardless of the filters set. For example, you could have the Social Networking filter enabled, but adding “twitter.com” to the Always Allowed list will allow Twitter to be accessed.







, Once you’ve enabled your filters, you can monitor the web usage on your network to see if people are trying to access sites that they shouldn’t. To do this, you will first need to ensure that stat logging is enabled. Log in to the Dashboard and click the Settings tab. Check the box labeled “Enable stats and logs” and then click apply.


Click the Stats tab to view the logs for your network. You can use the left menu to see what websites are being accessed and when. This will give you an idea if your children are attempting to access sites that they shouldn’t.

Edit the hosts file in Windows.,
Edit the hosts file on a Mac.,
Repeat these steps on each computer you want to protect.",How to Block Websites4," The hosts file allows you to block websites from being accessed on the computer you are using. It works for all accounts on the computer. Editing a host file will block a website, but does not offer any additional features such as tracking or time limits. Tech-savvy users may be able to change the host file and circumvent blocks.

Navigate to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc and double-click it. Use Notepad to open the file when prompted to choose a program.






Place your cursor at the bottom of the document. Put a blank line between your starting point and the end of the existing text.






Enter 127.0.0.1 <website> and press Enter. Replace <website> with the website that you want to block (facebook.com, youtube.com, etc.).






Enter another line with the same information except add the “www.” before the website. In essence you should have two entries per website that you want to block: 127.0.0.1 facebook.com AND 127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com.






Repeat this for each website that you want to block.






Save the file. Do not change the name, file type, or location of the file. Simply save the changes you’ve made. You may have to restart your browser for the changes to take effect.







, The hosts file allows you to block websites from being accessed on the computer you are using. It works for all accounts on the computer.Launch the Terminal, which can be found in the Utilities folder.






Create a backup of the hosts file. You can create a backup of the hosts file by entering the following command and pressing Enter: sudo /bin/cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts-original. You may have to enter your administrator password.






Edit the hosts file. To edit the hosts file, you need to open it in nano with the following command: sudo nano /etc/hosts/. This will open the nano window and you will see the hosts file text.






Start a new line at the bottom of the file. Enter 127.0.0.1 <website> and press Enter. Replace <website> with the website that you want to block (facebook.com, youtube.com, etc.).






Enter another line with the same information except add the “www.” before the website. In essence you should have two entries per website that you want to block: 127.0.0.1 facebook.com AND 127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com.






Repeat this for each website that you want to block.






Save your changes by pressing Ctrl + O. Once the changes are saved, press Ctrl + X to exit nano.






Flush your DNS. Use the DNS flush command sudo dscacheutil –flush cache to reset your DNS and load the new settings. Your browser should now block the sites you listed in the hosts file.







, The drawback of the hosts file method is that the hosts file needs to be changed on every computer that you want to protect. If your network has a lot of computers on it, this may prove unfeasible."

You can build a simple site by teaching yourself basic html and CSS coding. Just be sure that you can also make it look nice and professional!

, You can purchase or find free pre-made websites very easily on the internet. These are pre-made codes which you simply use and alter to your own needs. There are many reputable providers of templates, but a good one is Wix.

, If you want something tailored to your needs that looks professional and runs great, it's probably a good idea to hire a website designer. While this will definitely cost you money, it won't be as expensive as it sounds. You can get a designer on the cheap by advertising at a local technical college or university. Their experience will help guide you to a more successful, more professional website.

, You want everything to be as fast and easy to use as possible. Minimize the number of choices that someone has to make, make navigation extremely self-explanatory, and help them get to what they're looking for as quickly as possible.

, Positioning the various elements of the website, such as the title, sidebars, logos, graphics, and text, in the same places on every page will make your site navigable and intuitive.


Keep the same header at the top of every page. Whether or not your site content lends itself to many repeating elements, making sure that the top of every page is identical is a must.
Use logic in your design. The elements on a single page should be ordered logically by importance or by topic; the various pages in the site should do the same.

, While the layout should give your site structural consistency, the style should give it thematic harmony. Stick with two or three main colors and make sure they harmonize well. Avoid using too many font styles or sizes; if you do plan to alternate between a few, make sure you use them the same way on every page.


Use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to manage uniform style, and to make it easier to change elements across an entire website without having to go to every individual page.

, To make your text easier to read, break it into smaller sections. Use subheadings and appropriate spacing to separate each of the sections. Use bold or different-sized fonts to show the hierarchy and importance of the topics.


Pay attention to text handling. Don’t make the font too small, and widen the line spacing to make large blocks of text more readable. Large blocks of text will be harder to read; break these up into smaller paragraphs instead.

, Use standard HTML and avoid tags, features, and plug-ins that are only available to one brand or version of a browser.


Although most modern browsers and computers can handle complex images, everything will be a little snappier if your keep your images smaller in size and optimized for the web. Balance the desire for quality against the need for speed.

, Make sure that every link works as you expect, and that images appear correctly.


You may want to conduct some usability tests by having members of your target audience test the clarity and ease of use of your design, and give you feedback on your website.

, More and more internet browsing is being done on mobile devices these days. If you want your website to attract and keep the highest number of people, you'll need to design your website to be highly usable on mobile devices. The best thing you can do to ensure this is to have a separate website for mobile users but there are other options as well.


Look for examples of mobile sites. Often, sticking an ""m."" in the ""www"" place in a web address for major websites will bring up the mobile version of the site. You'll need to do something similar.

, In general, your design should be simple and to-the-point. Long gone are the days of complex tables and flashing graphics. All users will want something easy to use. This means simple design, minimal columns, and minimal text entry necessary to navigate the site.

, Responsive design is a way of coding your website so that instead of fitting to a few particular sizes of screen, it will adjust to fit any size screen. This is most easily accomplished by setting the column widths to percentages rather than pixels, but more elegant methods also exist.

, Many mobile devices can't display things like pop-ups, Flash, Java, or frames. This goes back, again, to wanting to keep your design as simple as possible.

, Under certain circumstances it may be easier for you to simply make an app instead of having a mobile version of your site. You don't have to have amazing programming skills to do this, however! Much like there are providers of website templates, there are also companies which will design a basic app for you. Conduit Mobile is a good service to use.

Find out what makes this company different from other companies that sell site traffic and why it would benefit you to choose that company over others.
Read reviews about the company, and call the customer service to find out how helpful and knowledgeable they are. Customer service is important, and many companies lack in this area. It's important to choose a company that provides quick, effective, and friendly customer service.

, Make payments once you have chosen your provider. Keep an eye on the statistics provided by the traffic provider as well as your own statistics through sites such as Goggle Analytics.

Summarize what you are looking for in an employee.,
Describe what you offer employees.,
Close your help wanted ad with a call to action.",How to Create a Help Wanted Ad," Use positive language and action-oriented verbs, and include specific details about the position and employer. For example, a help wanted ad headline reading, ""Secretary needed for realty office,"" could be more effectively reworded in this way: ""Dynamic Executive Assistant needed to organize, manage and oversee office procedures for busy, uptown real estate firm.""

, Before you get into the more creative aspects of writing help wanted ads, it is important that you provide readers with some basic information that will give them a preliminary idea of what your ad is all about:


Give your company name and location.
List the job title, along with specifics like job level, full/part time, temporary/permanent, night/day shift, salary range, application due date and date needed to start.
An example of a suitable help wanted advertising opener would be, ""ABC Corporation, located in Capital City, is currently seeking a full-time, entry-level Specialist to assume the night shift on a temporary contract basis. Salary is market-competitive and commensurate with experience. Applications must be submitted by March 1, as this position is expected to start on April 1 and run for a total of 6 months.""

,


Qualifications include any expertise that may be required for the job, such as knowledge of computer programming, familiarity with specialized equipment, proficiency within a certain skill-set and or an understanding of job-related terminology. For example, your help wanted ad qualifications list may read like, ""must know how to use basic accounting software, able to use a 10-key with 100 percent accuracy and familiar with billing/coding terms.""
List any formal training requirements. Help wanted ads should include details about college education and/or special certification courses that apply to the position.
Be specific about the type of experience you are seeking in prospective employees. In addition to employment-length guidelines, also include generalized experience requirements. For example, you may say, ""Candidates should have at least 2 years of hands-on experience working in the industry, and should be able to prove focused experience in the areas of customer service, recruiting and training.""

, This is a chance to sell yourself, and should include a number of components:


Say something about your company's history and/or reputation. For example, you may include something like, ""We are the industry-recognized leader in providing customized, effective marketing solutions, in business since 1977.""
Expound on the company culture. For example, you may choose to point out the open-door policy of management, the casual office atmosphere or the importance you place on team building.
Offer details about the benefits of working for you, such as advancement opportunities, insurance, 401K matching, bonuses and incentives plans.
Include a standard equal-opportunity employer disclaimer.

,


Instruct interested prospects on how, exactly, to move forward with the application process. You may want them to fax a resume, email a letter of interest or complete an online application.

Understand embedding.,

Follow the terms of service.",How to Add Fun Games to Your Web Site for Free1," An embedded game looks like part of your web page, but is still hosted on the original website, not using your bandwidth. If the original website takes down the game, it will disappear from your website as well.


Embedding is fairly safe, but malicious content may alter your website appearance, open pop-up windows, or run plugins.Embed content from trustworthy sites only, or learn how to alter the HTML to limit its access.;
, Some game websites display the HTML used to embed the game. This makes it as easy as copy-paste. Here are a few places that let you do this:


Bored.com
Fog.com
Kongregate.com/games_for_your_site (sponsored games only)
If the game you want to embed is not on any of these sites, contact the creators of the game and ask for permission to embed the game.

, On the web page hosting the game, look for a snippet of HTML code labeled ""embed"" or ""share."" Here are specific instructions for the examples above:



Bored.com: Click on a game. Click the ""Share"" tab underneath the game, then copy the second code snippet, labeled ""Embed.""

Fog.com: Click on a game. Copy the snippet labeled ""Embed this game,"" underneath the game description.

Kongregate sponsored games: Visit the ""games for your site"" page. Copy the ""Embed"" code next to the game you want to host.

Warning — this should be HTML code inside an <iframe>, <embed>, or <object> tag. If the code uses a different tag, it's probably just a link to the website and not the full game.

, Adding the game to your site is as simple as pasting that embed code. Place it in between the <body> tags of your HTML document, wherever you would like the game to be displayed.

, Most game websites have a terms of service for other websites embedding their games. If you do not follow the terms of service, the website may remove the game from your site. Here are a few typical requirements:No changing the appearance or content inside the embedded game's boundaries.
No claiming ownership of the game or charging a fee to play it.
No hosting the game on a site with illegal or obscene content.

Downloaded files may contain viruses and malware. Learn what to avoid and install antivirus software before you begin. Scanning each file before opening it is recommended.


Users playing the game will contribute to your bandwidth.

If you can't find a download link for the game you want, contact the game's creators directly to ask for permission.

, Most sites limit downloads to trusted games, and have you visit a special page to browse the download links. Others let you download any game from the individual game page.


Each of the links above takes you directly to a download page. Just click the download link next to each game, then double-click the compressed file to get the actual game files.
On Bored.com, visit the game page, click the Share tab underneath the game, then click the download link underneath the embed HTML code.

, Most browser games are made with Flash, so the file extension is .swf. Some games are made in HTML or, rarely, in other formats, but make sure you recognize the file extension before uploading it.


If you are using a free web hosting service such as Wordpress, you may need to install a plugin first in order to host the game. Look for a Flash player plugin to host a Flash game.
Some web hosts do not allow .swf files or other game files. In this case, upload the file to a free content hosting website, then link to it using an <embed> tag as described below.

, After uploading the game, you can link to the file just as you would any other page on your website. This will take the visitor to a new page to play the game, still inside your domain.

, If you would rather place the game inside an ordinary HTML page next to other content, you can use an <embed>, <iframe>, or <object> tag:


For a very basic embedding of a Flash game, write <embed src=""InsertGameURL"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash""></embed>. There are many ways to modify this tag. Follow the embed method above to find examples to learn from.
Some downloaded game files will come with a text document that includes embedding code to copy-paste to your site. Make sure you understand what the code does before uploading. Change the link to the file you uploaded instead of the original website.

, In most cases, you are not allowed to charge visitors money to play the game. Do not claim you made the game, and do not copy-paste the game description without permission. Some websites may have additional restrictions.

Enlist marketing and sales professionals to help. A talented graphic designer or webmaster might be able to make your site look great, but to convert visits to sales, functionality is more important than looks.

, There should be nothing confusing about your website's landing page.


Include a visible and unmistakable call to action. For example, a large ""Shop Sale"" button will help get visitors to the page where they will make purchases.

, Visitors might get frustrated if they add something to their shopping bag or cart, and then have a hard time finding their way back to the page they were shopping on.


Allow visitors to take a closer look at pictures or evaluate sizes without losing their place. Use pop up boxes or images that enlarge immediately when the cursor hovers instead of sending people to a separate page.

, When your site can securely remember credit card information, shipping and billing addresses, customers will have an easier and quicker time shopping and buying when they return.

, Your visitors will have a better shopping experience if they can get feedback on what other customers think. A positive review on a product might make them more likely to buy it.

, Online shoppers enjoy engaging with retailers and brands through surveys, polls, quizzes and sharing.

Keep the design of the web page light.,
Keep the design clean.,
Make it searchable.,
Think about the use of colors.",How to Create a Fast and Lightweight Web Page," This can be done by using simple shapes and figures rather than making use of some complex designs. By means of simpler concept of design the web page will stay light and will be frequently accessed which will help the visitors to get the appropriate information. The sites that are heavy take long time to open and in such cases people tend to choose the other sites, which are less time consuming.;
, Clean and an organized arrangement of the information is an important factor that will help people to visit the site frequently whenever they look for same problem. This not only helps in targeting the right information but also would help the viewer in locating the information faster. Messy work usually gives a wrong impression. So try keeping the web page clean and organized.


In case the information to be given is too much then to give a clean look one may divide the web page. This helps in fast operation of the web page and helps one to utilize the maximum space.

, The content being provided on any web page must be such that it can be easily found on the popular search engines like Google, as it is the most common and the oldest modes of knowledge seeking. To keep the web page light and fast let the content be brief but informative else people lose track of what is being said.

, Considering the use of colors when how to create a fast and lightweight web page is being talked of as an important factor. As mismatched color technique will lead to loss of information as well, it will just add weight to the site. The color selection must be done accordingly as this will let the users have an impact about the site. The colors that are being used for the background can be light to keep the page light and will help in easy reading.

Update.",How to Create a Personal Website," If you are proficient in html, you can skip this step.;
, The host is the company that will store the files that make up your website. Whether it's free or paid (see Tips), you'll need to set up an account first.

, If your host doesn't provide you with a domain or sub-domain name, you'll need to get one. It is easier for people to remember a simple domain name (ie: www.wikihowexample.com) than a tediously long URL (ie: http://www.wikihowexample.com/user/creator/index/pg223/creatorhmpg.html).


, You know this is a website for your friends and family, so think about what you will offer them when they visit. Some great ideas are tools like photo galleries, a calendar, a guest-book or forum, an e-mail list, and news on your front-page. Write down your thoughts as you come up with what to include.

, Even though you may think a personal website doesn't need one, a logo unifies and makes your website more comfortable for your guests. Use a program like Corel Paint Shop Pro to manipulate some text (possibly your name or family name) into an attractive and pleasing design. You could just save yourself the money and look for some open source software, gimp or inkscape should do just fine. They are also free and just as useful as Photoshop and Paint.

, Using HTML or a Web-Publishing tool like Macromedia Dreamweaver, create a ""Home"" page with an introduction to the website, news, and basic instructions on how to navigate it. Other pages such as a ""Biography"" page and a ""Contact"" page may soon follow. Save the pages as .html.

, Upload your pages and files to your root folder (""/""). Use an FTP program or your web browser to log in to the server. On your browser's address bar type ""ftp://your-domain-name.com"" and hit ""Go"" or the Enter key, then fill out the prompt with your username and password (provided by your host). You can browse your folders as you would on your PC or Mac.

, Keeping your family and friends up-to-date with news and photos is invaluable to them. Share new stories and jokes with them frequently to keep them coming back.

Try to limit yourself to a few goals. Your website may become ineffective if it has too many purposes to serve.
Designate 1 of your website's goals as the most important for you. Plan your website with achieving that goal in mind.
If you take different kinds of photography, such as wedding photography and nature photography, you may want to have a separate website or portfolio for each type. You can also have separate websites that showcase similar photography to network with different online groups or to serve separate, distinct goals.

, Decide how to design your site to target your intended customers or visitors. If you are only showing your website to family and friends, for example, it can be simpler and reflect a more casual style than the design of a photography portfolio you want a major company to see.

, If you want wedding magazines to see your work, choose wedding photographs for your site, for example.

, You may need to limit yourself to free services and templates or themes to design your website and spend money for hosting your site on a Web server.

, You may need to spend several hours learning the coding skills required to build your own website. If you do not have the time or desire to build your site from scratch, you can concentrate on finding a service, software, or someone else to make your site for you.

, Options include using photo-sharing websites such as Flickr or Photobucket, blogging websites such as WordPress, Blogger or Typead, or using software or another service to make your website.

",How to Create a Website Without Knowing HTML,"


Before you even think about building your website, you should register a domain name. A domain name is the thing that looks like this: ""yourdomain.com"".
Your domain name represents the URL (or permanent web address) of your website. Therefore, when anyone types in ""yourdomain.com"" or ""www.yourdomain.com"", they will see your website.
You register your domain name through a domain name registrar or hosting provider. You simply check that your preferred domain name is available, then register it (online).
Domain names are registered on an annual basis, and you can usually register it many years in advance (or set 'auto-renew').
Prices can range from between $10 to $15 up to as much as $35 or even $45 (this is for the same product!). Zappy Host has some of the best prices on the web - and if you purchase hosting at the same time, the domain name is even cheaper ($1.99 at time of writing).
If you don't have a domain name yet, get your domain name now (before someone else beats you to it!);
,


A web host (or hosting provider), is a company that makes your website available for the world to see. They have the equipment and technical skills to make sure your website is available to the world, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

, A bad host can have almost no support at all! If you're new to creating websites, good support can reduce the stress that comes from doing something for the first time.


Also, some web hosts have an online website builder. A good website builder can enable anyone to make a website - even complete novices.

,


This part can be as easy or as hard as you like it to be!
The easy way? The easiest way to build a website is to use your web host's website builder (assuming they have one). As mentioned, ZappyHost provides Website Tonight which makes it extremely easy for you to make your website.
The hard way? OK, if you think a website builder sounds too much like cheating, you probably want to learn how to build a website the way the pros do it - by coding/programming. If this sounds like you, then see this introduction to making your own website. Also check out the Quackit homepage for links to thousands of pages of tutorials and other web building resources.

Use Polyfills to add feature to the browser if it's not present.",How to Design a Responsive Website," Although you could try to make your website respond to all devices in all conditions, this is probably a waste of time and money.;
, Start with a design approach for mobile devices. To achieve this, use simple HTML and CSS with less of Javascript, since there are many mobile devices which don't support Javascript.


Add viewport meta tag using the code as shown: <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""/>

, Progressive enhancement uses web technologies in a layered fashion enabling everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, using any browser or Internet connection, while also providing an enhanced version of the page to those with more advanced browser software or greater bandwidth. Now you have a basic website that will work fine for all devices.

,


Use frameworks: Javascript Frameworks: Modernizr, jQuery Mobile, Polyfills.
Use mobile validators or emulators for validating and checking your website design.

, With so many browsers available, it is very important to make a website that loads evenly on all the browsers.


Use Modernizr and Polyfill for identical rendering on different web-browsers.
Modernizr is a feature detecting JS .We can add fallbacks for features unavailable.The image show code snippet for detecting canvas support .

, As IE versions below IE8 do not recognize new HTML5 elements, use HTML5SHIV.js which includes all the new elements.

You can save yourself a lot of time and maximize the quality of your content by reading other curriculums and adapting it to your class.Use your preferred search engine to find available course outlines or ask other teachers you know that have taught the course.


Make sure that material you find online isn’t licensed or you’ll need to get permission to use it. If you aren’t sure if content is licensed, play it safe and ask anyway.;
, With online courses, it will be more difficult to control the flow of information as students can chose how much time to spend in a given sitting and what order to go in. Because of this, it is especially important that your content is organized consistently and with purpose.Divide the core subject matter into major units or modules and create further subdivisions that guide students through the content.


Make extensive use of overviews before each module or even each subpoint. This will help the students understand what they’ll be learning before they get started.Try to be consistent with the amount of information, the amount of time required, and the number of assignments for each module. This will help students adjust to the pace of the course early on and prevent confusion., Decide what you want students to get out of the course as a whole and out of each individual unit. These outcomes should be explicitly stated to the students and guide your development of the content.Start with objectives for individual units. Focus on analytic goals such as “Understand the economic and political causes of World War I,” rather than goals related to memory like “Learn the important dates leading up to World War I.”
Clear learning objectives will make it easier to design assessments like tests and paper assignments.

, Find a professional textbook that covers your subject matter. Use the table of contents as a guide for how you outline your material and develop the specific content.


Textbooks will often include ideas for assignments, discussion activities, and sample quizzes that will help you populate the content.
Don’t feel as though you have to follow the book exactly. The books will often include information that is superfluous for your class’s purpose.
Talk to your school’s administration before selecting a book. They may have a contract set up with certain companies., A Learning Management System (LMS) is the software that you and your students will use to navigate the course. Each LMS has unique features and understanding their strengths and weaknesses will guide you in terms of what types of content you can or should use.The most popular LMSs are BlackBoard, Edmodo, Moodle, SumTotal, and SkillSoft.If you have some software development skills, you may want to consider an open source LMS. These software are free to use and will allow you to manually change aspects of the code to tailor the LMS to your preference. The downside is that they usually don’t come with a customer support service
Talk to your school’s administrators. Most schools have a contract with a specific LMS provider or will simply provide a preferred suggestion. If you need to select your own, ask other teachers what they prefer.

, One of the most significant limitations of online learning is that students can’t interact with you or each other as directly. If you don’t include an interactive aspect of the course, the education students are receiving will be little better than if they simply bought a textbook and read it on their own.Message boards are an available feature on all major LMSs and will enable you to teach in the Socratic tradition where students debate, ask questions, and offer personal reflections on the content.


Give students relatively brief (300 words or so) writing assignments and then require them to respond to each other’s submissions. These writing prompts should evoke some controversy and allow room for differing and contradictory responses.Each unit should include some kind of interactive assignment so that students are consistently engaged.
This type of assignment may be more difficult for math or science course. However, you can use message boards to encourage students to explain how they worked out certain problems or applied formulas.
You’ll want to outline some rule of engagement in the syllabus to ensure that everyone on the message board is respectful and refrains from personal attacks. It may help to stay away from questions that involve particularly hot button political issues unless they’re directly related to the content., Some online courses, particularly MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course), will have hundreds of participants that make discussions onerous. Assign students into groups with no more than 20 members. This will facilitate more effective message board discussions.This can also build familiarity that makes it easier for students to form study groups and help each other through the course material.

, A closed-book policy can be difficult or impossible to enforce for online courses and open-book exams will do little to test knowledge retention. Prioritize written assignments, especially ones that involve critical discussion on your message boards, over multiple choice exams.If you do include traditional exams in your lesson plan, they should be based largely on written responses and include a time limit.

, A great way to build a personal connection with your students is to host a live video session where students can ask questions and you can answer in real-time. Many LMSs will offer a live video feature but if it isn’t available, you can invite students to a Google Hangout or a Skype session.


Many live video programs will allow students to type in questions in a message bank while you answer over the video stream. You can also request that students send you questions via email before the session.

, To build a personal connection with your students, create a brief introductory video. Include a personal introduction and explain your background in the subject matter to build ethos.


You will also want to provide an overview of the course material including the expected learning outcomes, the specific material that will be covered, and a list of the major assignments.

, While it is good to encourage students to use the outline to guide them through the course, a search function is critical to allowing them to easily go backwards through the material and remind themselves of previous lessons. Most LMSs will have search functions readily available but it is a good idea to make sure your content is searchable and make adjustments if necessary., Students may not have certain document viewing softwares or their computers may have limited capabilities for viewing certain front-end coding languages. To avoid issues, save all documents in with Word or PDF formats and, if you are altering the coding language, leave it in HTML. This will assure everyone can view your documents and pages for free.When you save a document, there will be a dropdown menu under the bar where you change the documents name. It will include options to save the document as a PDF or as a Word document.

, Glitches and temporary outages are essentially unavoidable when using complex online software like an LMS.When they do happen, you will likely be inundated with emails from angry and confused students, especially if a technical difficult occurs before a deadline or exam. Prepare for these situations either by printing out materials to distribute, postponing assignments or developing your materials so that students can continue to work even when they can’t access the LMS.


If you are using a professional LMS, include contact information for the customer service department on the syllabus.

, Some students will have hearing, eyesight, learning or other disabilities that make online technologies difficult for them. Most LMS systems will offer accommodations like out-loud readers or text enlargement for the sight impaired.Speak with your school administrator about your school’s disability accessibility policies and include necessary information on your syllabus.

, It’s important to run through your course on the live site before your class begins. This is especially important if you are creating a significant amount of new content. Focus on the flow of the material, how easy it is to access different modules, and check for errors.


You may want to ask another teacher or a student with some available time to run through it. After you’ve spent a lot of time developing content, it can be difficult to see it with fresh eyes.

Google and search engines alike are like a big fat popularity content, the more quality content you write, the more quality links back to your website that you have, and basically, the more you put your website out there among popular websites and communities across the internet, the more likely you are to rank well.,
Think of the top 5 keywords that potential website visitors may search for when looking for your products or services in search engines.,
These keywords are best used through-out you content, in your meta data and as anchor text when completing off-page optimization and link building to increase your Google rankings.

",How to Create a Website Using a Website Builder and Promote It Online2," Just follow below steps to go the extra mile to ensure that their website gets found and to ensure their online successes.

, You can also research the best keywords via the Google's keyword tool, simply Google it and it will tell you how many searches that particular keyword has per month both globally and locally.

,"
"
With the keywords you have just created for you site, create a title and description for each web page, a good website builder will generally have these options built in and all you will have to do is create a quick and descriptive title tag, a brief description of each web page and insert it into the required section so that search engines pick up what your website is all about.

,
If your website builder does not offer this function, then see How to Use Meta Tags.,
Create quality content and then try to insert your keywords in various places through-out it without it affecting the quality and readability of the text and ensure that your keywords are used mostly at the beginning and the ending of a paragraph.

,
There are many SEO consultants who advocate this method of on-page optimization.,
Images are more to catch the eye rather than for search engine purposes but never the less, you can still do certain things to help search engines pick them up and ensure that they form a positive impression with spiders.

,
All you need to do is ensure that the file name of your image is descriptive, it has an alt tagand try to make sure that your images aren't too large, this can slow down your site or web page load time and slow load time will affect your search engine rankings.

,
There are a lot of websites out there that say ""submit to our list of search engines and you will get better search engine rankings"", but the fact of the matter is that they are simply trying to get you to enter your email so that they can market their other products and services to you in the future and having submitted your website to 300 plus search engines does not mean that you are more likely to rank higher in the important ones or carry any real weight with the search engines that actually matter except for a few handy back links.

,
Ensure that you submit and verify your website with the 3 major search engines, once submitted and verified, your website will pick up your website.

,
Once regarded as a staple in terms of search engine optimization stakes, directories are becoming less important in terms of back links and carry less weight in terms of rankings factors etc.,
The ones that Google rates more highly are generally the ones that are the most difficult and time consuming to submit to as most of the ones where it is easy to submit to are more likely to have spammy, lesser quality links and content within it.,
Articles are regarding as not only one of the best ways to get good rankings but also to get good amounts of traffic also.,
If you are planning to reach a broader, more global audience, you will need to write and submit at the very least depending on your keywords and competition 3-4 articles a week to have a significant impact.,
Submit your articles to your blog to increase quality and relevant content on your site, then syndicate your articles by submitting them to article directories and other articles resources.

,
Blogs are a great way to get a few quick back links to your website and for building content on your own website.,
When commenting on other peoples blogs, don't just drop links for the fun of it, try to add a little comment that relates to the website owner's blog post and drop a link somewhere inside your comment using a html link code so that it doesn't sound too spammy.

,
With blog commenting and inserting links into your comments, all you need to do is copy and paste the example html link code from websites like http://www.quackit.com or http://www.w3schools.com into a text file, insert your domain name where it says.

,
Forums are a good way of getting back links to your website and also a good way to get targeted traffic to your website via posting on forums that are relevant to your field and simply dropping a couple of links here and there.

,
Forum code and inserting links into forums is a little bit different to blogs as you will need a different sort of code to create a backlink, this code is called BB codebut works in much the same fashion as a HTML link code.

,
Forums were once a great place to get back links but are slowly losing their juice as not only are forums being spammed more than ever before with poor quality links and poor quality content but social networking sites are become more popular places to hold discussions.",How to Create a Website Using a Website Builder and Promote It Online3,", Insert your title, description and keywords on each page, which must be unique for each page in between the <head> and </head> tags within your web page.

,, Also, with your keywords, it is also a good idea to use bold and italics to highlight particular keywords so that search engines pick it up easier.

,,,,, The trick here is to submit only to directories that seem reputable.

, Some examples of some reputable directories are DMOZ, Jayde, HotFrog etc and a lot of the local directories are good to submit to also.

, This process is quite time consuming and you may run into a few bouts of writers block every now and then but the rewards are greater than the downfalls.

, Local businesses however will only need to write a couple a month on their topic and this help to keep your business up there in the search engines.

,, Most website builder tools will allow you to insert a blog into your website and generally it will only take a couple of clicks and all you need to do then is create articles and various posts and this will help as long as it is quality content with your search engine rankings.

,,,,, Never the less, still use this method as link diversity is good for your rankings.

Define your goal.,
Find a market.,
Secure a domain.,
Build your site.,
Keep it fresh.",How to Create a Website and Earn Money1," In order to attract any investors (in the form of advertisers) you must have a place for them to sell their wares. Attracting advertisers must be your primary goal, as that is what will make your financial aspirations a success.


Know what advertisers or ad placement algorithms are looking for in an advertising venue (i.e., your website): generally, it's potential buyers with disposable income who visit your site in significant numbers, and would be interested in products that are closely related to the content on your site.
What you want in a site, then, is to attract—and keep—a lot of visitors. The longer they stay, the more likely it is that they will eventually leave your site by clicking not on the back button, but on your advertiser's links.;
, To generate the most traffic, and thus the most revenue, be selective in your target market. While every demographic has its strong points and weak points, studies have shown that younger people are generally more optimistic and more adventurous—and thus likely to click on an advertisement more readily.


Keep in mind that the goal is clicks, not sales: that's what generates your revenue. Once the visitor has clicked out of your site, it's up to the merchant to make the sale. You get paid, regardless of the outcome.
Search the web for trends and ideas for websites, and include the year in your search so that you avoid wasting search results on what was hot in 2006. For example, searching Google for ""website ideas 2012"" returned nearly a billion results. From there, it's just a matter of combing through to find ideas that pique your interest.

, In the halcyon days of the early 21st century, you could create a business name, and find a domain to match. These days, it's virtually impossible. However, you can be creative with hyphenated names. While ""geeks.com"" (and .net, .org, even .xxx) is taken, trying something like ""website-4-g33ks"" instead.


One good way to proceed is to secure a "".com"" domain, find a host (many domain registrars will also host sites), and build your own site. This has the advantage of being the most flexible in terms of design and installation of custom code.
Alternately, you can sign up with a service such as Blogger, from Google, or Wordpress—both of which will not only let you put your site name in front of their service name (e.g., geeks.wordpress.com), they will give you that and a website for free. The advantage, aside from that, is that Blogger and Wordpress give you a great number of really well-designed templates to make your site look visually awesome. The downside is that generally takes having a ""pro"" version (i.e., paid for) before you can do any serious customizing.

, Using the templates provided, or a site of your own design (or from a designer), put together your website. What you do will be based almost entirely on the market you are attempting to reach. Again, though, whether you are ultimately offering a personal service, like ""Cleavon's Auto Repair Site,"" or a total web-centric site like ""Sara's Mouth-Watering Recipes,"" the goal is to keep people on your site. That means content is king—same as it ever was.


If you're offering a service, your site could have content specific to your specialty. Cleavon, for example, might have some basic articles on changing oil, fixing a flat, or a FAQ about all those little sounds a car might make. Sarah could feature, along with recipes, information such as weight and measure conversion, the differences between types of flours, and anecdotal tales of kitchen disasters and successes. In both cases, going beyond the basic service provided gives visitors a reason to stick around—and click on ads!

, Don't post one or two articles and call it a day. Remember that this is your income stream we're talking about developing, so think of it as your job—part time or full time, you have to devote some time to it every day if you want to see the paychecks come rolling in.


The more you write, the more interest your site will hold. The more interest your site holds, the more people will follow it. and more importantly, the more relevant your site will appear to the ad placement algorithms. More ads = more clicks = more money. Never lose sight of that goal.

Using a Site-build of the hosting company.",How to Create a Website Without HTML," You should know some basic things about having a website. This means you should learn what Hosting, Domain, and Server is. Read the articles on Wikipedia or elsewhere.;
, Buy a domain and hosting package online. This is fairly easy, but you should use your intuition to know whether to trust a site or not. Read here about buying a domain name, and here for articles about buying a web host.

, Plan your website well to avoid time consuming. It's okay and even recommended to spend some hours or even days to plan the site well. Just take a piece of paper, pencil, eraser and a marker to start planing your site. Take a separate paper and write your all ideas on it. Then start planning about the site-map. Here's a good guide on how to plan your site.

, If you would have bought the domain and hosting from a good company, they would offer you a free site-building software or an online site-building platform to build your site. If you are beginner this way is very easy.

Using a WYSIWYG software. There are many WYSIWYG software available on the net. Dreamweaver and Web Studio 0.5 are recommended. Last mentioned have one month free trial period which is well enough to create a full website. It is very easy, but if you are having trouble, there's many tutorial on the web, just search for it.

Using an open source developer. Probably you would have heard about Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal. Which are famous open source programs which are fully free to use. This is bit advanced but can be used for big projects.

First download Wordpress or Joomla and upload the files to your web server using a FTP client like Filezilla. When you log-in to your server you can see a folder call 'public_html' under this folder there should be a folder for your domain like 'www.yourdomain.com'. You should upload the files in that folder to start developing the site. Once you uploaded, open your browser and point it to www.youdomain.com/wordpress or www.yourdomain.com/joomla. You have to do some settings there. if you done with that you can develop your site without a single coding.

You get paid a very small amount for each impression (view) or click. Therefore, the more traffic you generate, the more clicks and impressions you will have, and the more money you will receive.

, Every time you post, every time you make a change, every time you change a period to an exclamation mark or correct ""teh"" to ""the,"" let the world know via Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, LinkedIn, and all the rest of the social media world. The key is to spread the word.


Have accounts on all of the above, and make sure you have prominent links to your website on all of them.
Start an email campaign as well. Once a week, publish a ""best of my site"" HTML email—frequent enough that people enjoy the content, but not so much that it becomes spammy.

, Find which ads work best, and do more ads and pages like those.


By continually refining your process, each visit will be a higher value for revenue generation. Always remember: the longer they stay, the bigger your paycheck will be. Good luck!

, Companies use affiliate programs to boost their online sales, and most of these affiliate programs are free to join. Every time a visitor buys an item through the affiliate link on your website, you earn affiliate commission.

Create a standard layout using a DOCTYPE, a STYLE, and a DIV with two nested DIVs.,
Name your DIVs so that they can be worked on.,
Tell CSS how to manipulate these DIVs.,
Add some content at this point.,
Preview the page.,
Make some changes to fix this.,
Make sure the two nested DIVs are now treated as table cells.,
Look at the difference that's made.

,
Add more text into one of the cells.",How to Create a Webpage with Equal Heights Columns,";
, The first DIV is going to use ""id"", while the nested DIVs are going to use ""class"".

, You make these style changes within the style tags. Make sure of the ""#"" and ""."" in front of the tags. These are important, and without them, everything breaks.

, It will give you some idea as to how things are going to look as you progress. Add some content to the left and right DIVs.

,


Not only is this pretty bland, but the DIVs are not properly aligned either. You'll notice that ""Right"" is under ""Left"", not to the side of it.

, Change the CSS beginning with the ID, which needs to be treated as a table. Set a width of 80% of the screen and centre align the whole box.

, Create a border around the two, so that you can see how this is all going to pan out.

,, You'll see that no matter how big the box on the left gets, the box on the right retains the same size as the left one.

Think about what kind of website you and know what your website is about.,
Map out all your plans.,
Build the site so it represents your goal or product (etc.).,
Be certain that you have something to offer.,
Make your website interactive as well as informative.,
Have a team or support crew.,
Establish a base of fans, viewers and friends.,
Expand at a steady but ongoing pace.,
Make sure you can receive feedback from your viewers.,
Keep the content fresh, new and interesting.,
Enjoy what you are doing.,
Make yourself known in the world of whatever you're writing about.,
Create your website before you advertise.,
Advertise the right way.",How to Create a Successful Website," The site must be representative of your intended use, whether that is to be for sales, blogging, curation, sharing information or images, a fansite, a help site, a shopfront for your business, running games or puzzles, giving Facebook a good run for its money, and so forth. There are plenty of reasons to begin a website but the main one must be clear to you before you begin, otherwise you'll be paying for an empty domain and wondering what to do with it.;
, Then create your website. This could mean going on Wordpress, Intuit websites, etc., or or it could mean even paying for your own unique domain name. Take a look at all your options before you start the site. If you're building a social networking site you'll need to search individually for that. If you're looking for a forum, you'll need to do the same thing. The same goes for just about any site; do the research in depth first.


If you are using a free website maker, scope all your options out before you choose one. There are many limitations with ""free"" that might not serve your needs. Then again, they might be ideal; play around with a few to see what is out there.
Some website making sites are better than others, so try to study each website before you decide which one is best for your needs.

, If you are creating a site about monkeys, don't start talking about elephants. Stay on topic as much as you can and try to add as many features as possible.


Give your website a funky layout that people like looking at. Make sure it's not a sickly shade of green or a polka dot design that gives you a headache.

, Give plenty of information, links, images, widgets, and the like. Don't make the information too dull and where possible, accompany the text with pictures.


Know who your viewers are. If your viewers are going to be kids, put a lot of fun features. If your viewers are going to be business people, try to make it as professional as possible. If you want your viewers to be kids, don't make your website plain white with a boring font and talk about politics!

, Put quizzes, polls and plenty of input opportunities on your website. Don't cram it all with widgets, though.

, This is an important step. Chances are you aren't going to make or maintain a successful website if you're going it alone.


Divide up jobs and only use people you are close to for starters. Otherwise, there is a risk that people you don't have allegiances from will take your idea and use it for their own.

, Give them something that will encourage them to keep coming back.

, If you create your website and unleash it nationwide, you're not going to grow very fast at any rate. Facebook became popular because it started at one place. It got popular there and once they got a certain number of members (or hits in other cases), they would expand to another area. The reason it doesn't work if you start out big right away is because a very small number of people will discover your website because it'll be buried beneath hundreds of other websites who are trying to do the same thing. Be smart and start off small until you reach a certain number of members (hits, visits, or views) then expand to a little bit of a bigger range.

, Put your e-mail on the website or have a forum/chatbox. Use the feedback to constantly improve the readers' experiences with your site.

, Also keep it relevant. Even when your site is famous, don't forget to regularly update. This is a surefire way to keep the people coming.

, This step sounds a little Disney, but if you don't enjoy what you are doing, you're not going to be happy with anything you do on the site. Changing it out of personal frustration can be disastrous if your viewers don't like your personal take on it. Instead, learn to love what you're engaging with, so that you have a good feel for the viewers' needs and interests. If you get cheesed off with the whole project over time, stay its owner but give the daily managing to those who see new and exciting things in it.

, Get to know the owners of similar sites and get lots of people to link to you.

, One common mistake is to start advertising the website before it is even done. This is a terrible mistake and could easily lead to the downfall of your website as people find it half finished and vow never to return again as their time has been wasted. Create the website, and have its beginning features done before you open it up to the public.

, What does this mean? Don't post your URL to every person's wall on Facebook or advertise on YouTube (unless it's on your own channel or page). These types of advertising get passed off as spam and you'll end up with hate on your website. Instead, use keywords so that the site will show up on Google or Yahoo.


Use a wide variety of keywords for more advertising.

Take a minute to sit down and consider some of the following questions: What will the game be called?,
Think about ideas you have and write them down.,
Think of a name.,
Think about your target audience.,
Think about how you will carry out the costs.,
Learn a few programming languages.,
If you aren't very good at the aspects of development hire a team of people to help you.

,
Decide on a type of virtual site.,
Start thinking out some features your game will have.,
Take a break.,
Work on the details of the features you planned before.

,
This is the boring part.,
Find a place to host your website.,
Once you have your website up, start sketching out a design.,
Write out the different page names.,
Create each page on your website.,
Using Microsoft Paint or GIMP create all characters, items, and any other pictures you'll need.,
Type your terms of service, rules, and privacy policy on a new page.,
Add a chat room and/or message board.,
Go to your website and make sure nothing seems wrong.

,
Invite some of your friends and family to become website testers.,
If you want to, put your website on Google, Bing, and/or Yahoo.

,
Is your website 100% unique?,
Wait for members to start coming.",How to Create a Virtual Site," What is the target audience? Is the cost of making and managing the game manageable? Will there be a market for this game?And how will it work?;
, Give yourself 3 minutes to come up with as many ideas as possible. Write them all down quickly. Remember, ideas are what makes the web spin around.

, A name can make or break a game. Your name should be memorable, but not too hard to spell, say, or remember. Shorter names seem to work better as well, but that’s more of a personal preference.

, Many people overlook target audiences. When you design your game you need to keep in mind who actually plays your game. If your game is for young children then you don’t want a game that’s overly complex, hard to navigate through and has few images. Also, take into account your audience’s familiarity with computers and the Internet. A child isn’t likely to be able to understand complex directions or sequences, whereas a hardcore video game addict should have no problem navigating menus and following technical directions. Games made for ages 5-7 should have lots of pictures, big buttons, be easy to play, and have few words to keep younger children interested. There should be lots of games, puzzles, animations, and things to keep kids from getting bored. A suggestion would be using popular cartoon characters as they play the game. Games made for ages 8-17 should have more text, but also a lot of pictures. You want to make sure it’s easy enough for the younger players to get around and play, but hard enough to keep the interest of older players. Most games made for teenagers will automatically attract younger kids and adults at the same time. Adult games have more of a risk. Keeping younger players from seeing what they shouldn’t can be a hassle. For an adult game, you can assume they have decent computer skills and are possibly hardcore gamers. Complexity, strategy and action should play big parts in these games. A mix of all ages is the hardest challenge. Games have to have a mix of easy play, medium play, and hard play for all age levels. You’ll have to manage keeping the attention of all age groups. This usually happens on its own if you have a really popular game because everyone wants to play no matter what his or her age is.

, Games are inherently expensive. The bigger and more popular your game becomes the more it’ll cost you to keep it up and running. Are you willing to put up the expense of domain names, servers, bandwidth, hardware upgrades, technical support, and so on? A larger game can reach up to 100 thousand members and can cost up to $300 a month just in server costs. That’s over $3,600 a year just to keep the game server online. Then you have to factor in advertising, domain names, and additional expenses such as postage and letterheads and office supplies. Will you be able to carry the costs of the game’s expenses if your game isn’t generating enough revenue to support itself? These are all really important questions. Take the time to research how much it costs to buy a domain, get hosting setup, and any other additional fees you may run into before you start. You may not have a big budget - don’t let that limit you!! There are several things you can do to limit your expenses. Limit the numbers of members who can join your game. This will reduce your bandwidth — the amount of data passed back and forth over the Internet — and will encourage your members to stay active. You can even go through and delete accounts that are inactive after a certain period of time. Limit how many people can play online at a single time. This isn’t the best solution, but sometimes it’s a good option if your game is popular but you don’t have many people that play online at any particular time during the day. Don’t expand your hosting/server needs as your costs increase. If you can’t afford it, then you can’t afford it. Make your members deal with slower response times and hangups. Not great for customer service but at least they can all play. Don’t advertise. This goes against the grain, you make a new game and you really want to share it, but word of mouth is the biggest and best form of advertising out there. The more people that know about your game the more will want to play and the higher your expenses. Make your game a “friends only” game. Limit it to people you know or friends of people you know. If it’s just a game you plan on making as a hobby, something to do in your spare time, this is a great alternative.

, Some helpful ones will be HTML, CSS, MySQL, and PHP. Go to lissaexplains.com or jadendreamer.wordpress.com to find some good programming language tutorials.

,, Pet, Fighting, Strategy, and Role Playing are just some ideas.

, Think of one topic, describe it in one or two sentences, and choose one word or phrase to narrow down on. For example: Game World - Each map in the game is called a map node. There can be an unlimited number of map nodes in the world. Map Node - Each map node has a name and a description. Each map node can have unlimited coordinates. And so on...

, It is important to give your hard working mind a good rest. Take a break whenever you need it. You could even take one after every step.

,, Write your terms of service, privacy policy, and rules. This is all the stuff that keeps you and your website safe. Look up the Internet laws and read through each one of them carefully. If you want to, get a copyright and get a sole proprietor or LLC.

, It will probably cost money, but it will usually be cheap. If your site address looks like www.yoursitename.hostingcompany.com you will need to buy your own domain. The best addresses are yoursitename.com or your-site-name.com You can use .com or .net. Pay all needed fees to get the website and register your domain.

, Your website's design should include a good looking layout, but not be too hard to navigate.

, For every page write out what you want to say. Write down what widgets (like a chat room) you want.

, Remember the layout shouldn't be too complicated so make sure the layout of each page is the same.

, Save them and put them on your website when/where needed.

, Make that page invisible and include a link to it on the login page.

, Add any other ways you want your members to interact.

,, Give them one month or so to use all the features and report to you suggestions, comments, or problems they have with using them.

,, Chances are no. Go to different virtual sites like yours and join them. See what the competition is, and if you see that someone else had that idea before you, try to change it a bit.

, Whenever an idea of a new feature pops into your head write it down and when you get the chance, add it!

Replace the example <loc> with your URLs.,
Use the optional tags.,
Save the file as an XML file.,
Upload the sitemap to your server.,
Submit your sitemap to the search engines.",How to Create a Sitemap1," The editor should be a plain text editor, such as Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac. This method is best suited for small sites, as you will be manually entering in each page.;
, Paste the following into your text document. Basic sitemaps are XML files that are submitted to search engines in order for them to be able to read your site easier. By using this format, you can quickly list all of the pages on your site:

, Visit your site in a browser and go through each link, copying the URLs from your browser’s address bar and pasting them into the template. If you have more pages than space in the template, simply copy a “<url>” section to the bottom as many times as you need.

, In the first entry of the example, you will see several tags that can be added to each URL, these are optional but may make crawling your page easier for the bots.


The <lastmod> tag is the date that your page was last modified.
The <changefreq> tag shows about how often your page is updated. Always means that it is updated every time a user views it, while Never means that it is archived.
The <priority> tag allows you to rank the importance of each page on your site in relation to the other pages. This value can range from 0.0 to 1.0. The default priority for all pages is 0.5.

, Click File and select Save As. Use the “Save as type” menu and select All Files. Change the file extension from “.txt” to “.xml” and save the file as “sitemap.xml”.

, Once your sitemap file is complete, you need to place it in the root folder of your web server. This is the lowest directory on your web server. The final URL for your sitemap should be www.example.com/sitemap.xml

, All of the major search engines allow webmasters to submit the URL for the file to their web crawlers. Log into the Webmaster Tools for the search engine that you want to submit to and navigate to the Sitemap section. Paste the URL for your sitemap into the field.

Upload your video on YouTube.",How to Create a Web Series," Try to keep it organized, and keep it true to the audience that you are gearing it towards. For example, if you are making a business video, try not to drench it in jokes.;
, You will need actors and actresses. If your series is animated and you can't find anybody else to help you, many recording programs come with voice editing filters. If you are doing this, I would recommend using Audacity.

, There are a number of ways to do this. The most popular method is to either draw clips on paper and use a scanner, or just do the clips on paint. If your series is live action, film your video using any video camera.

, If your series is animated, display your clips very fast unless there are some still frames. If it was filmed using a camera, just put the clips together normally. I would use Windows Movie Maker, but you can use whatever program you want.

, If the video is animated, make sure that you do a good job with lip-sync.

, Make sure it is under 15 minutes and is completely finished.

Open Dreamweaver and go to file > New.,
Create the Pages.,
Look at the Code.,
Edit the Headers for Each Page.,
Edit the Content and Menu Items.,
Edit the Footer.,
Take a look at your website in ""live Mode"".",How to Create a Mobile Website with Dreamweaver," You will then see a ""New Document"" Window. On the left hand side, you want to pick the option ""page from sample"" then in the next column, choose ""mobile Starters"", then ""jQuery Mobile (CDN)"";
, Once you open the jQuery Mobile (CDN) file, you will see a page that looks similar to this:


Although this technically is a one page document, each header represents a different ""page"". For example, ""Page One"" is the home page for the mobile website, ""Page Two"" could be the about us page, ""Page Three"" could be your services page and so on.

, These steps can be pretty tricky if you are unfamiliar with basic HTML. To create the content, I like to work in ""split view"" on Dreamweaver. How to get to that mode is if you look at the left hand corner of Dreamweaver, below the file menu, you will see four options ""code, split, design, and live"" like this:


Choose the highlighted option ""split"", and you will see a view of code and the actual site side-by-side. Let's take a look at the code for a second.

, There is (div data-role=""page"" id=""page""), which means that it is the beginning of a new page. Note that each page is associated with a number 'div data-role=""page"" id=""page2""' is the second page, 'div data-role=""page"" id=""page3""' is the third page and so on
'div data-role=""header""' is the header area, and you put your header information between the two ""h1""and ""/h1"" tags., 'div data-role=""Content""' is the beginning of the content section. This is where you put the actual content of each page. Note that in the first page there is:


and if you look at the actual web page, you see that the first page has a list of links. 'ul data-role=""listview""' means that you want a list of links in the content area.When adding any menu items or 'data-role=""listview""', make sure you link the correct text with the correct pages. For example if page two is ""About Us"", page three is ""Our Service"", and Page four is ""Contact Us"" then you want to put:






Now to edit content, simple put your text in between the 'div data-role=""content""' and '/div' tags. For example:







, To edit the footer, simply put your text in place of the ""Page Footer"" text., Remember where you switched into ""split mode?"" right in that area, there is a button that says ""live"". Click on that, and you will see what your website will look like on a phone!

Decide the scope of your website, and plan to meet the needs of your potential customers.,
Focus on making your website look professional.,
Create quality content so that potential customers are able to learn what they need to know by visiting your website.,
Prioritize having a website that is easy to navigate.,
Implement a product selection and purchasing system that is easy for your customers to navigate so shopping with you is a simple process.,
Implement search engine optimization techniques so that your website displays favorably in search engines.,
Dedicate yourself to keeping your website as up-to-date as possible.",How to Develop a Commercial Website," Be sure to obtain the correct amount bandwidth to accommodate your expected traffic. If your business sells merchandise, be sure to develop a fully fledged set of product pages that are easy to navigate--if you sell services be sure to list the contact information of the appropriate business associates corresponding to the particular services described.;
, People, in general, will take your website more seriously and appreciate it if your website has a clean, professional look. Nothing should distract from the content of your website or make it more difficult to navigate.


Bright colors with too-high contrast and too much saturation of pictures and videos are examples of what can detract from your website's focus. Also poor quality photos, disorganized information, and a haphazard design can make a website look unprofessional and amateurish.

, If you make the effort to show people you know what you are talking about and prove to them that you can help them understand the knowledge related to your company's purpose, they will be more likely to trust you and feel comfortable buying from you.


Develop your product information so that it is both informative and easy to understand.

, Ideally, visitors should be able to find what they are looking for in a half dozen clicks or less, starting from your website's homepage.


Focus to make your website's navigation as intuitive as possible, which lessens the time visitors must invest to find what they need. If a person cannot find what they need within your website in around half a minute, then there is a good chance that they will visit a competitor's website instead of continuing to trudge through yours.

,


Display your products with photos and complete descriptions so all your products are easy to find and learn about. The selection process needs to be easy as well, making it also simple to remove items the customer has selected in case they change their minds.
Utilize a shopping cart system that is easy to use. If feasible, take as many forms of payment as possible, including credit cards and online payment methods.

, Ideally, you want your website to show up on the first page when a person performs a search using keywords appropriate to your website's purpose.


Strive to be one of the first few websites displayed when a user searches for your types of products or services. Creating a sitemap and utilizing both Meta and ALT tags will help your website display favorably.

, Doing so will help ensure that existing customers continue visiting your website and that new visitors will find their way to your website and want to become customers.

Review Your Needs What do you need your audience to know?,

Every site is different so it's important to think of what your site needs to achieve. Do your audience need to know what you do? Does your audience need to know about an organization? What are you trying to convey?
Try taking these thoughts into account and list some of the things you want your audience to know when they visit your site.






Now go back and pick through your ideas. Exclude any that seem crazy or ridiculous. After crossing out some of the choices, start circling any that seem to stick out. Sometimes it's best to only choose the bare essentials of information.






Take this final list of points for the Homepage and hold onto it; it's important you don't lose it.







,

From the moment your site is seen, it presents an image. The colors, fonts, and images you use reflect largely what you think and feel about your own site, and the audience will feel it. Think of the image you want to convey.






At the end of this, you should either have a sketch, or a page full of words and ideas. From here, try to pull a layout or a design. Lay all your findings out on a table and start experimenting. Check out Webs for free website templates to help get you started.






As you begin to reach a design or layout, take into account your audience. Who must this relate to largely? At the top of your homepage, you should list the must-haves, followed by what you would like, and then ending with any extras. This should help keep you organized in your website concept.

Determine the age group of the children you want to target.,
Place activities on the website that will interest the age group you have chosen.,
Design the websites using bright and vivid colors.,
Add a higher amount of pictures versus text to children's websites.,
Place sound effects and music throughout the website.,
Develop characters with happy, positive moods.",How to Develop Websites for Children," The design, colors, and content you place on each website should be compatible with the level of development and interest for that particular age group.


Develop your website based on one of the following age groups: toddlers up to age 4, children aged 4 to 7, children aged 8 to 11, children aged 12 to 15, and teenagers aged 16 years and up.;
, To keep children engaged with your website, you must develop activities or games that will hold the interest of that particular age group.


Place educational games and activities that meet the development level of the age group. For example, children aged 4 to 7 may enjoy interactive math games that involve addition and subtraction; whereas children aged 8 to 11 may find games that involve multiplication and division more challenging and fun.
Place printable objects or activities on the website for each age group. For example, children up to age 11 may enjoy pages they can print and color with crayons, or cutout patterns for paper dolls or paper airplanes. For websites aimed at teenagers, develop activities such as quizzes that can be printed and handed out at slumber parties.
Place videos or basic animations on websites designed for young toddlers who may not have the motor skills needed to move a computer mouse or to press a series of keys or buttons.

, Bright colors will catch the attention of children, stimulate their minds, and also convey cheer and happiness; which in turn will increase the likelihood of children revisiting that particular website.


Use bold, bright colors in all pictures and text without using an excessive amount of colors such as white, gray, or black.

, Children are more interested in and attracted to images, graphics, and pictures, and are less likely to read and respond to large blocks of text.


Use large graphic buttons for navigational commands instead of text. For example, if a website requires children to proceed to the next webpage, use a large arrow to convey the meaning of ""next"" instead of requiring children to click on the word ""Next"" to access the next webpage.

, Sounds and music will help keep children interested in and engaged with the activities they are performing on the website.


Add music to the background during certain games and activities, or allow sound effects to play every time a button or link is clicked on within the website.

, When children interact with happy characters, they may be influenced to revisit the website again in the future due to having a positive experience of their own.


Use animations or photos of real people who are smiling and displaying positive, non-threatening body language.

If you're making the site for another person, company, or organization, you'll need to find out what they expect from the site and its functionality. Everything you decide here will have an impact on the final website.


Does it need a storefront? Do you need user comments? Will users need to create accounts? Is it article-oriented? Image-oriented? All of these questions and more will help inform the design and structure of the site.
This can be a drawn-out process, especially for larger companies with lots of people involved in the project.;
, A site map diagram is like a flow chart and shows how users move from one page to the next. You don't even need pages at this point, just a general flow of concepts. You can use a computer program to create a diagram, or sketch it out yourself on a piece of paper. Use the site map diagram to show how you envision the web page hierarchy and connectivity.

, A popular method for a group is to use a stack fo cards to figure out everyone's ideal approach. Take a stack of note cards and write the basic content of a single page on each one. Have your team organize the cards in the way that they deem most useful. This is best for situations when you are collaborating with others to create a site., This is the original low-budget planning method, and allows you to quickly erase or move content and reroute it. Draw the design on pieces of paper and connect them with string, or draw the outline on a whiteboard. Great for brainstorming sessions.

, This is more geared towards redesigns than new sites. Enter each of your pieces of content or existing pages into a spreadsheet. Make notes as to the purpose of each one and use this list to determine what goes and what stays. This will help cut the fat and simplify the redesign process.

, An HTML wireframe is a skeleton of your future site, using only the most basic tags and blocks to represent content. It answers the question, ""What goes on the screen and where?"" Formatting and style are completely ignored in a wireframe.The wireframe allows you to see content structure and flow before committing to style choices.
HTML wireframes aren't static like PDFs or images, and allow you to quickly move content blocks around to create a new structure.
A wireframe is interactive, which is beneficial to both the developer and the client. Since the wireframe is written in simple HTML, you can still navigate through it and get a feel for how moving between the pages works. This is something that can't be expressed through a PDF concept.

, Block out the content of your page in gray boxes, with the most important content at the top. The blocks are arranged in a single column, with the most important piece of content on the page at the top. For example, if the page is the company's About page, the company details might go on the top, followed by a staff list, followed by contact information, etc.This doesn't include the header and footer. The gray boxes are simply a visual representation of the content that will be found on the page.

, There are several programs that can help you with the wireframing process. The amount of coding knowledge required varies from program to program. Some of the more popular programs include:


Pattern Lab. This site specializes in ""atomic design,"" where each piece of content is thought of as a ""molecule"" that makes up the larger page.
Jumpcharts. This is a website planning and wire-framing service. It requires paid subscription but allows you to quickly build wireframes without worrying too much about coding.
Wirefy. Wirefy is another ""atomic design"" system. The tools are available for free fro the developers.

, A good wireframe can easily be converted into the actual site later. Don't worry at all about style during the wireframing process. Instead, use markup that can be easily understood and swapped around with little effort.Less is more with a wireframe. The goal is to simply build the structure. Visuals can be adjusted later with CSS and advanced markup.

, It may be tempting to make a single wireframe and say ""Cool, I can apply that to every page and I'm good."" In reality, this will lead to a generic and boring site. Take the time to wireframe each page, and you'll soon find that every page has its own organizational needs.

, It will be much easier to see how you website style looks if you have your actual content instead of placeholders. You don't need too much content, but it will look much better in mockups if you have some copy and original images.


You don't necessarily need the body of an article, but you should at least have actual headlines.

, The internet is much more than simple text websites. In order to stand out in your niche, you'll need a variety of different content types to attract and retain visitors. Some possible content to keep in mind:


Pictures.
Audio
Video
Streams (Twitter)
Facebook integration
RSS
Content feeds

, If you are including photos on your site, your initial impressions will be much better with professional photography. A single good photo is worth more than twenty bad ones.


Look for recent art photography grads for cheaper solutions than long-time professionals.

, The written content on your page will determine the vast amount of your web traffic. While you don't need to worry too much about content creation at this point of the design process, it doesn't hurt to start thinking about it, since you'll need content on a regular basis once the site goes live.


Beyond article content, there are written items that you will most likely during the website construction process. This could include contact information, company names, or anything else that will be used in multiple places on the site.

, These are the things that are seen on every page on your site, such as the header, footer, and navigation menu. Create a very basic style so you can see how all of your pages will look with them in place. This will be very useful as you move into the layout process.


Don't worry too much about the details, but do try to get it somewhat close to how the headers will eventually look.

, Start moving the clocks of your wireframe out of the single column and into their general locations on the page. For example, you might move the navigation block to the left side of the page, and a list of headline to the right.


Keep experimenting with the layouts for a few pages before moving on. Let others test them to see if they feel organic.

, Use a program like Photoshop to create a mockup of a few pages of your site. Use the layout you've settled on as a guide. You can work much quicker in an image editing program and get everything just how you want it. This will allow you to use these images as references when it comes time to actually code.


Include actual content in the mockup to ensure that everything looks good together.

, Start adding your content and elements to the page. Don't worry about style yet, just get everything in the correct location. This will help you tell if your style changes are going to work.

, This is essential for maintaining a cohesive style, especially for larger sites. If the site is for a business that already has visual branding, this should be incorporated into the site design. Things to potentially consider in a style guide:


Navigation
Headers (<h1>, <h2>, etc.)
Paragraphs
Italics
Bolding
Links (active, inactive, hovering)
Image use
Icons
Buttons
Lists

, Once you've decided on a style and design for the site, it's time to start implementing it. CSS is one of the easiest ways to implement style across a page or the entire site. See this guide for more details on using CSS.

There are a lot factors to take into consideration when determining the value of a domain, so if you are unsure it may be wise to contact a company that performs these assessments. Some of the major factors include:


Traffic - This is one of the primary influences of the domain's value. The number of visitors the domain gets from users typing the URL, searching, or coming from links will have a big impact on the value, especially if these visitors are monetized.
Top Level Domains - The most valuable websites are "".com"" websites. These are far more valuable than any other top level domain (.info, .biz, .net, etc.).
Length and Readability - One- and two-word names in English are the most valuable commodities. They are especially valuable if they are directly related to an industry (hotels.com, biking.com, etc.), read well, and are easy to memorize.;
, Domains that sell for thousands of dollars are rare. Unless you have a highly sought-after domain, you may not receive a large amount for it. It will help to be realistic in your pricing if you are intent on selling them., One of the best ways to get offers on your domain is to put up a simple ""For Sale"" message on your site. This will let any visitor know immediately that the domain is available for purchase and how to get in contact. There are several ways you can do this:


Many domain registrars provide simple free websites. Use the tools provided to create basic page that indicates the domain is for sale. You could include a link to the domain listing or include your contact information (beware of spam).
You can add a page to one of your existing websites and redirect all of your for-sale domains to that sales page.
Adjust your WHOIS information to show that your domain is for sale. You can change your registration information to reflect the fact that the domain is for sale. For example, you can add ""Domain For Sale"" to the end of the owner name.

, If you aren't sure if your domain is going to be sold soon, you can register it with a domain parking service. These sites will provide landing pages for your domains that contain links to advertisements, which can earn you money while you await a buyer. Most domain parking services include ""For Sale"" signs and services.

, There are a variety of selling services that will list your site. These services take a cut of the sale, but can lead to much more exposure to the domain. Some services allow you to add extra descriptions and comments about the domain, which can help boost sales. Popular sites include:


Sedo
Flippa
GoDaddy
AfterNic

, There are many brokerage services available that will actively try to sell your site. These services typically cost more than a standard listing service, but may yield better results.


Always research the brokerage service before signing any contracts. Make sure they are effective and fair in their pricing.

, Besides listings and brokerages, there are auction sites as well. eBay is actually one of the most popular domain name auctions, and there are others as well. Many listing services offer auction services as well.

, If you receive an offer, make sure to respond as soon as possible. If you wait longer than 24 hours, you may lose a buyer.

, When you finally decide on an initial price for your domain, use charm pricing to help entice buyers. This is the act of knocking $1 off of the price to make it look more attractive (e.g. $499 vs. $500).

, If you have a domain that you know is worth a certain price, make sure you don't settle for less. Come armed with detailed information about the worth of your domain, and explain to the buyer why the price is what it is.

, When you are dealing directly with the buyer, make sure that any money that is transferred goes through an escrow service. This will ensure that all checks clear and that you aren't left with a bounced check and no domain. Escrow services may add a few days to a sale and cost you a percentage, but they can save you a lot of heartache.


If your domains are selling for smaller amounts, escrow services may not be cost-effective."

Include relevant content on several different pages of the website.,
Keep your website consistent with other materials.,
Consider your multiple audiences.",How to Set up a Website for a Nonprofit Organization," The amount of money you are able to spend will determine whether you hire a website consultant, use staff members and volunteers or look for templates online.;
, If you have a large organization with IT support, you likely have a network that can support your website. Your computer staff can make recommendations.


Look for companies that specialize in hosting nonprofit websites. For example, Red Rooster Group, Cozality and Charity Advantage offer to host and design websites for nonprofit prices.

, Take a look at other nonprofit websites to get an idea of what you like. Use that inspiration for your own site.


Check out the organizations and sites that have gained international attention. These include Invisible Children, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Nature Conservancy and One.

, Your nonprofit website's homepage should include an introduction to who you are and what you do.

,


Share success stories about how your organization has helped people and communities.
Promote the work you do. Advertise upcoming events, highlight employees who make a difference and honor volunteers and board members who have made a difference.
Keep your design work attractive and appealing, but remember that content is more important. What you write about your work and your purpose is more important that fancy graphics.
Make your website interactive and engaging. Include links to your Twitter, Facebook and other social networking sites. Link to a blog or other websites that support your partners.

, Your logo and terminology must be consistent with your business cards, brochures and other print materials. You want a consistent and recognizable brand for your nonprofit organization.

, Set up your nonprofit's website so that it is appealing to all the people who will visit it.


Design a site that is appealing to donors. Make sure there is a ""Donate Now"" button that makes contributing easy and efficient. Collect information from your donors so you can stay in touch with them.
Make sure your site is available to the media. Getting publicity and press from journalists and bloggers can really help your organization get some visibility. Create a ""news"" section that includes press releases and a media kit. Include contact information for any media inquiries.
Set up a website that is inviting to volunteers. Nonprofits thrive on the work of volunteers, and your website should be the place where potential volunteers go to learn about you and what you do. Be sure to provide information on how to volunteer and who to contact.
Keep your website accessible to the people you serve. For example, if your organization works with people who have disabilities, make sure the font on the site is large enough to read for people with vision issues.

, If you don’t already have an .htaccess file at the root of your server, open up a new text file and add these lines to it:


php_value auto_prepend_file /localfilepath/global_prepend.php php_value auto_append_file /localfilepath/global_append.php


Important Note: If you copy these two lines from your web browser, you might need to delete the carriage return and make your own. Sometimes a browser’s carriage return will cause your .htaccess file to fail (you’ll know immediately if it has failed because your site won’t come up).


Then save it to the root of your server with the filename "".htaccess"". If you already have an .htaccess file, just add the above lines to it.

, This is the information found with your domain registration. You may host your domain somewhere other than with your Web host, but if you bought the domain and hosting together, you may find it with your hosting account. You will not be allowed to move the domain if it is within 2 months of purchase or expiration. Renew it if it is almost time to expire.

, Make copies of all the data on the Web host because you will need your own copy to upload to the new host when you're ready. The simplest way to do this is to use a FTP program to download all the files and folders associated with your website that you will be moving to a new host.

, The new host will give you access to the hosting account through a temporary IP address and password until the DNS changes have been made. Use this information to access the new account and upload all the files in the same structure as your old site. This will help ensure there are no errors on the new site and that your customers see no downtime during the switch.

, Make sure everything works correctly because no one can see the site yet. At this point, customers are still seeing the site on your old host.

, If you need help with this, your new host can show you the best way to go about setting up the e-mail accounts. You will likely receive 2 copies of the e-mails for a few days because you will get 1 from the old and new host.

, Change the DNS records with your domain (at your old host or with the company you bought your domain from) to point to the new hosting company. If you need help with this step, your new hosting company will likely assist you.

, Once everything has been uploaded to the new host and the DNS has been changed, you no longer need the old account and can safely cancel it.

, Test every page on the site and all the links to and from your website to ensure they are working after the switch. Broken links not only look poor in terms of search engine optimization, but they are quite frustrating for your users.

, If any scripts are needed to run any features or functions on your website, it is important that all of these are functioning correctly after the switch. They may have only worked because they were still directed at your old host.

Don’t make an incredibly long, single web page. Avoid crummy or cheesy graphics, broken links, and grammatical errors in content.;
, Since the customer is not in the physical store. He cannot actually see, touch and feel the products. So it is to be ensured that you provide good quality images with brief description on the web page. Also make details of the products as an option to see, for the customers.

, You need to have proper classification of all things. Use breadcrumbs to make navigation more clear. All the products should be classified under broad categories. Even under those categories, there should be sub-categories so as to make easy for the people to search for their desired products.

, Light colors, minimal boxes, and less advertisements sell more. Having too much clutter can make your website look cheap. About 75 percent of all U.S. Internet users watch online video during a typical month. But it does not mean that your e commerce website needs to have a flash/video. It depends upon the target customers and products too. Like if you are selling books, the videos are not going to help you. Don’t Use Flash Animations Unless They Serve a Purpose.

, Blogs, user forums and reviews,and other tools give visitors more reasons to visit your site. Also, customers can leave their feedback about the products or services they use.

, Don’t always ask for registration rather you may tell customers to save their purchases so that in case of any confusion regarding the inventory, they can always refer back. The cleverness of an e-commerce website’s personalization technology has a major influence on its design. Sophisticated eCommerce websites use a variety of personalization technologies in an effort to determine the best selection of products to offer the visitor. Amazon.com has made use of it for the first time. It tried to push their client’s books to a visitor, based on that visitor’s past orders and also they used the statistics, which used to predict what someone looking at a specific book might also be interested in reading.

, This information will help you to understand where the visitors have come from, which items have been visited the most, the navigating pattern, and all of this would help you to identify areas of improvement in websites.

Consider the purpose of having a church website.,
Decide on the most effective web address.,
Understand the people who use a church website.,
Pick the most effective content for the website.",How to Make an Effective Church Website," A website is simply a tool that we use to communicate information on the internet. Websites are a way that a Christian church can fulfill Christ’s command to His disciples in Matthew 28:19-20; “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” A church website will both direct people to visit the church and give information to the members of the church.;
, How to choose the best web address.


Make it Easy to Remember . Consider how a web address gets communicated:

Word of mouth: A church might have a terrific website but it will do no good if a member can’t remember the domain name to tell their friends.
Signs: A church might have a terrific website but it will do no good if no one can remember the domain name they saw as they were driving by a sign in their car.
T-shirts, flyers and business cards: A church might have a terrific website but it will do no good if no one can read or remember what they read on the media


Keep it simple. Consider:

Spelling
Make it easily able to be typed. 
Length
Memorable words
Reject Hyphens and Numbers
Only Choose Dot-Com Available Domains
Keep the Name as Short as Possible  


Create and Fulfill Expectations.

A properly worded web address can create expectations. It could possibly entice a hesitant visitor to check it out.
Likewise, the words in the web address should fulfill the created expectation through the content on the sight.



, Knowing the audience of a website helps a church focus on ways to make it most effective for the audience. With the image of their website’s audience a church must consider the specific needs when designing the site.


Perspective visitors are…

searching for a church
wanting to anonymously investigate the church
looking for a positive first impression of the church
will likely only understand clear language with familiar vocabulary
attracted to an appealing style
appreciate easy-to-use layout
wondering the whos, what's, wheres, hows and whens of the church
trying to contact a person from the church to answer questions
wondering if the church will be friendly, welcoming and relevant


Existing church members are…

Looking for one online source to find church documents and calendars
Concerned about their privacy
Hoping their church is appealing to non-members
Preaching and need a place they can direct people to explain their beliefs



, What content do people want to see on a church website?

Click the Image button (if available).,
Paste the direct URL to your uploaded image.,
Use tags if there is no Image button.,
Try an HTML code if tags don't work.",How to Upload an Animation in a Signature," You can find these on countless websites online, or you can create your own if you're comfortable with image editing software. If you're using a GIF found online, right-click on it and select ""Save image"" or ""Download.""


While it is possible to link to a GIF hosted on someone else's site, it's best to upload the image you want to use directly to your own image host. This will ensure that the image will always be available, as you don't have control what someone else does with their website.
You can make your own animated GIF by converting a movie file or animating multiple still images.;
, When including an image as a signature, you're going to want to keep both the dimensions and the file size of the image in mind. Very large dimensions can be cumbersome and annoying for the recipient, and large file sizes can take a long time to load.


Right-click on the image and select ""Properties"" (Windows) or ""Get Info"" (Mac). This will allow you to see the file size of the picture. Click the ""Details"" tab (Windows) or expand ""More Info"" (Mac) to see the dimensions.
Try to keep image files under 1 MB for quick loading, and under 500x500 to prevent the image from taking up too much screen space.

, If your GIF is too large, you'll want to resize it before you upload and attach it to your signature. The easiest way to do this is to use an online image resizer website, as GIFs can be trickier to resize manually than static images.

, You'll want to find a reliable host that can keep your image for free for an extended period of time. Below are a few of the most popular free image hosts:


imgur.com
imagevenue.com
photobucket.com
imageshack.us

, Most image hosts will require an account, though they may not be necessary to upload a quick image. Creating an account often lets you keep your images online for longer, and is good if you plan on hosting multiple images.


The process varies depending on the service, but generally you can click the ""Sign Up"" button and create an account with your email address.

, Use the uploader tool on the image host that you signed up for. Again, the process will vary depending on your service, but they are all generally self-explanatory.


You'll usually be able to browse your computer for the image file, and some allow you to drag and drop the file into the browser window to upload it.

, In order to link to the image in a signature, you'll need the address that links directly to the image. Many image hosts will provide multiple types of links. Look for the one that ends with the image extension (GIF for animated images).

, Most email services allow you to include a signature, and many support including images as well. Signatures can be added by logging into your email service's website. You can also add signatures using your email client, such as Outlook.

, The process for this varies significantly depending on the email service that you use. Generally, you'll need to open the settings page for your account.

, Some services, such as Gmail, have a button that you can use to insert the link to your image. You'll find this button in the row of formatting buttons above the Signature field.

, When prompted for the image address, paste the full address that links directly to your image. It should end with the .GIF extension.

, If you don't have a button to insert an image, you can use a basic HTML line to include it. Most recipients will have HTML enabled and will be able to see the embedded image. Type the following into your Signature field:


{{{1}}}

, Send yourself an email using your new signature to see how it looks. This will allow you to make any adjustments you need to before you send it out to other people.

, This varies drastically from forum to forum, so check your forum's FAQ or settings section to find your account preferences.

, Note that not all forums allow signatures. If the forum you're using doesn't have a Signature section, you may be able to still include one by manually adding it to each post you make.

, Many forums will have an Image button in the Signature editor that allows you to insert your image link.

, This will insert the image with the proper coding into your signature.

, You may still be able to insert the image by placing the image URL between tags. This is a common image tagging system for many message boards.

, If you still can't add the image to your signature, you can try embedding it with HTML code, which some forums accept. Note that many forums disable HTML for security reasons:


Type {{{1}}} into the signature field. If the forum allows HTML code, you'll see your image appear in your signature when you make a post.

Maintain a link back to your home page.,
Design a row of links called navigation trail or breadcrumb trail on your pages either at the top, bottom, or both.,
Make sure to have page jumps on pages with multiple sections.,
Use Back to Top links on all long pages with multiple sections.,
Build your site-map.,
Make a trade-off between too many pages and too much navigation.",How to Make Efficient Navigation Structure in Your Website," This is done to ensure that visitors don’t get lost when they go too deep in the site, and return to the home page easily with just one click and look for different information. Use a graphic banner or a logo for your homepage link. Keep it somewhere obvious, usually on the top of the site's pages.;
, This enables the visitor who has entered your site from a search engine to backtrack at any point and return to the parent page. It also tells them their location within the site. Use the hard-coded bread crumbs or JavaScript bread crumbs to make the breadcrumb trail.

, For long pages, in-page navigation is necessary. This is where page jumps helps. With just one click and your visitor reaches the part of the content he/she is searching for.Remember, too much scrolling makes the visitor give up after some time and leave the site. A page jump helps you avoid that.

, This link takes the visitor to the top of the page. Place ""back to top"" links at the end of every section.

, A site-map is an important part of a website. It clearly shows all the contents of the site in one page, structured and hyper-linked for the convenience of visitors. Apart from making the navigation structure user-friendly, it also aids the search engine spiders/crawlers

, In other words, keep your pages medium in length. Long pages, although they make navigation simpler and shorter, are boring to visitors. On the other hand, very short pages makes creating a navigation structure a hard process and the visitor is bored from going from page to page too many times to find what he/she wants.

Compare your website's top countries and cities against the top countries and cities of other websites of the same kind, using the following general rules based on the website's domain.",How to Understand Your Website Audience Profile," Some possible motivations are discussed below.

Identifying changes to make to your site's content (articles, videos, products), style, and user flow. While demographic and interest data are potentially useful, the most valuable information here is actual user behavior on the site, which is not the focus of this guide. Nonetheless, the analysis presented here can be useful, at least as a sanity check. For instance, if you have a website that deals with news in California, but it is getting most of its traffic from Illinois, then that is concerning and might lead you to reimagine or rethink how you are presenting your website content and how you are promoting or advertising it.
Identifying external advertising or promoted content (not affiliated directly with your site) to show to users, to better monetize your site. Demographic and interest data help you identify things you can show to your users that are relevant to them, even if not directly connected with your site. For instance, if your site is visited by many college students, showing ads for cheap college textbooks or study notes sites might make sense, even if your site is a music site. Conversely, an academic site targeted at college students may be a great place to advertise non-academic products targeted at college students.
Identifying ways of marketing your site or product offsite, e.g., through social media, search engine optimization, search ads, display ads, or real-life advertising. Once again, demographic and interest data are helpful because they help you understand where to find potential new visitors, customers, or community members. In addition to marketing your product through targeted advertising (online or offline) you may also be interested in conducting targeted surveys using tools such as SurveyMonkey Audience or Google Consumer Surveys.;

Note that all analytics services in widespread use work by sending data through Javascript to third-party websites, and use cookies (first-party for tracking a user within a site, and third-party for tracking users across sites) to identify users. In particular, no data is collected for users who have either disabled Javascript or have an adblocker on that blocks analytics tools. uBlock is an adblocker that defaults to blocking analytics tools as listed in the EasyPrivacy list, including GA.Moreover, if the user has disabled cookies, or is using incognito/private browsing or a different browser or device, the user may not be correctly identified and the user's activity may not be properly connected together.
Some information, such as language, location, network, operating system, and browser, is implicitly collected from the environment in which the user interacts with the website.
Some information is inferred from the user's entire web activity, tracked using third-party cookies. Interests are typically inferred this way; other data (including demographic data) may also be inferred this way when not present in a more reliable form. This information is missing or inaccurate on browsers (such as Safari) where third-party cookies are mostly disallowed,as well as for users using most adblockers.
Some information is explicitly entered by the user, such as information that users enter into their Facebook or Google profiles. While generally the most reliable, this does depend on trusting the user to enter the data accurately (in most cases, this information is not verified by third parties). Google offers a hybrid solution for ad customization: it infers interest data automatically from browsing behavior but also allows logged-in users to edit their interests manually., One key consideration in identifying dimensions is the typical dimensions used by analytics providers and advertisers. These may not exactly match your goals, but they may be the best you can get. The following dimensions are typically used when people think of user profiling. Their availability in different analytics tools is indicated parenthetically.


Language (available in GA): GA reads language from the user's browser as the user's language of first preference. Data may not reflect the user's actual language of interest.Languages are specified using two- or four-letter codes.Location (available in GA and QM down to the level of city): GA infers location from the user's IP address, but does not display actual IP addresses to protect privacy.Location data may be incorrect for users using a VPN or a mobile browser (such as Opera Mini) where page requests are handled server-side.
Network: This is inferred from the user's IP address.This may be incorrect for users using a VPN or a mobile browser (such as Opera Mini) where page requests are handled server-side.
Operating system and browser: This is inferred from the user agent string used by the browser. This is generally accurate, except in cases where the user is running an emulator or virtual machine that emulates a different browser or operating system.Gender and age (available in GA if activated; available in QM): This is collected only if you as a website owner opt in. You need to first upgrade Google Analytics to enable remarketing and advertising features,then turn on demographics and interest reports.Google Analytics joins user data with the following three data sources to identify users: the third-party DoubleClick cookie (DoubleClick, also known as the Google Ad Exchange, is a display advertising network owned by Google), the Android Advertising ID (for apps on Android devices), and the iOS Identifier for Advertisers (for apps on iOS devices). Of these three, the only one relevant to web activity is the DoubleClick cookie.Interests (in-market segments and affinity categories) (available in GA if activated; available in QM): As with gender and age data, interest data is available only if you as a website opt in by first enabling remarketing and advertising features and them turning on demographics and interest reports.Highest education level completed or currently pursuing (not available in GA; available in QM)
Income level (not available in GA; available in QM)
Race/ethnicity (not available in GA; available in QM)

,


For any dimension (such as age, gender, ethnicity, income bucket) we can consider the composition of your website visitors based on that dimension. Consider gender, the simplest example of a dimension you might be interested in. The composition of your website visitors by gender will read something like ""45% male, 55% female."" Composition data is available in GA and QM for any dimension that is being tracked.
Another idea related to composition is that of the index (as Quantcast calls it).The index becomes relevant when the overall sizes of the populations for various values of the dimension are different. For instance, in the United States, African-Americans constitute 13% of the population. Thus, a website that gets 26% of its traffic from African-Americans is over-represented among them (also known as ""over-indexed""), even though they are still a minority of users. The index is essentially the ratio of the composition among website visitors to composition in the overall population, expressed as a percentage (i.e., out of 100), though usually quoted without the ""%"" sign in front. So in this case (with 26% of website traffic from a subpopulation that is 13% of the population), the index is 26%/13% * 100 = 200. An index above 100 means the subpopulation is over-indexed, whereas an index less than 100 means the subpopulation is under-indexed.
Unlike composition, that can be inferred purely based on the visitors to the website, the index requires the use of data for a general population. Moreover, the index can be different depending on what general population we use for benchmarking. For instance, for a local news website for a city, do we use the population of the city, or the population of the country, or world population? Do we restrict to people with Internet access, or to all people?
Note that for large subpopulations, the index has a ceiling effect. For instance, non-Hispanic whites in the United States are 62% of the population, so even if a website gets 100% of its traffic from Caucasians, the index is still only 161. On the other hand, for a subpopulation that is only 5% of the whole population, the index could be as high as 2000.
The distinction between index and composition is less important when looking at gender, especially in developed countries, because the number of men and women using the Internet is almost equal.

,

The composition is a measure of the relative proportion from different subpopulations. The index is a similar measure, but adjusting for overall population sizes.
For instance, a website can have a 95% male audience (so a male index of about 190), and yet be popular among a negligible minority of males. On the other hand, another website can have only a 30% male audience, and yet be visited by many more males, because it has way more overall traffic.
Put another way, changes to the composition may be in a direction opposite to changes in absolute numbers. For instance, if a website suddenly becomes popular in a forum visited mostly by females, the overall traffic from both males and females could go up, with the proportion of males going down.

, If you (intentionally or unintentionally) make your website more visible or prominent to some subpopulations, that will be reflected in the statistics. This could create a feedback loop: you advertise your website to a subpopulation, they use it more, and you focus your energies more on the subpopulation. There are three ways of identifying and countering this feedback loop.

Filter for traffic with referral sources or channels where you know you are not introducing any bias.
Use the population distribution in the channels that you are attracting traffic from as the baseline relative to which you index your site's visitors. For instance, if you are advertising your site on a forum where the audience is 70% female, and yet only 60% of the visitors from that forum are female, that might be an indication that your website appeals less to females, even though a majority of your site visitors are still female.
Restrict attention to visitors who are highly engaged (for instance, based on a threshold of number of pages viewed) or repeat visitors. Compare the composition of highly engaged or repeat visitors against the composition of all visitors.

, You can change what you do on your site (in terms of content or advertising) but your influence on society and culture are likely to be small to begin with.,


Since websites do not usually share their GA data, your best option for getting good benchmarks is Quantcast data. You can access Quantcast data for a website by typing in quantcast.com/domainname (you can exclude initial ""www."" from the domain name). Many websites do not use QM. Others use QM but make only some of the data visible to the public. You should scroll down to the section on demographic data to see if the website has allowed for sharing the information.
One key limitation of Quantcast is that most of the websites that share data with Quantcast and allow Quantcast to show the data publicly tend to be media websites whose business model is advertising-based. Moreover, most of them are either based in on have a significant presence in the United States, since Quantcast data is most reliable and most useful to show to advertisers for United States audiences. In particular, if the topic of your website is not one that media companies and publishing groups have interest in, it can be hard to find examples to benchmark against.
Another thing to keep in mind regarding the availability of Quantcast data is that the decision to share data with Quantcast is made at the level of the media company or publishing group, rather than the individual website. Therefore, either all (or most) of the websites under a given publishing group would have QM data publicly visible, or none would. Some publishing groups and companies that have publicly available QM data for most of their sites include: the Stack Exchange Network (Stack Overflow and all Stack Exchange sites), Tegna, Woven Digital (Uproxx, Brobible, and some other male-focused humor and celebrity news sites), Vox Media Network (Vox, Eater, Racked, and a few other sites), Onion Media Network (The Onion and sister sites), COED Media Group Network (COED, College Candy, and Busted Coverage), Bonnier Corporation Network (many outdoors sporting sites as well as popsci.com), and Idle Media (HipHopEarly and sister sites).
Quantcast data is available for most websites on the Stack Exchange Network. Therefore, looking for the closest site on the Stack Exchange network to your site can provide some insight. However, Stack Exchange sites are Q&A sites and traffic patterns to Q&A sites differ from those to other sites covering the same topics. The adjustments for different demographic dimensions are discussed at more length later in this guide.
In order to better understand whether GA and QM data might diverge for sites like yours, you could turn on QM on your own site for a while and then compare that data against GA data for your own site. If the two are in agreement, then the numbers are likely to be reliable for other websites in your category.

,


Keep in mind that, due to limitations in the data Facebook shares through its API, sociograph.io is unable to display demographic and geographic summaries of users. It does, however, show the list of top visitors, that you can then manually examine to determine their demographics, interest, and location.
One important point to note is that top participants may not be representative of the general audience. For instance, they may be more likely to be male (since males are more likely to participate publicly in groups and discussion fora, and are also more likely to engage in extreme behaviors).

, As a general rule, gender, age, and interest inference for your website, as well as gender information for other websites to use for benchmarking, are most widely available and reliable in the United States. Some data is available for other large countries (United Kingdom, Canada, India, etc.). For small countries, as well as countries with significant Internet censorship (such as China) data is spotty and unreliable. Note that location data tends to be reasonably reliable around the world, since it is based on IP addresses, with the exception of places where the use of mobile Opera Mini browsing is prevalent., You can use GA on your own website to drill down by multiple dimensions together.


For instance, rather than simply seeing the distribution by gender and age separately, you can see the distribution by combinations of gender and age. For instance, you might discover that your site is more popular among middle-aged males than middle-aged females, but also more popular among college-age females than college-age males. Similarly, you can drill down by combinations of gender and location, or age and location. GA's default interface only allows up to two drilldown dimensions at a time (a primary dimension and a secondary dimension),but you can create custom reports in GA that filter based on more than two dimensions. Unfortunately, publicly available QM data does not include benchmarks for combinations of dimensions.
You can even combine demographic and interest dimensions (that are the focus of this page) with content-type dimensions, such as a specific page URL, or a type of visitor (based on engagement, session length, or whether the user is a new or repeat user). In particular, you can get insight about what pages on your website are visited more by people with particular demographics and interests. Note that this data may not be very useful if your overall site traffic is not large enough for the segments to have statistically robust information. Unfortunately, the benchmarks you obtain using publicly available QM data do not allow you to access corresponding data on other websites. One workaround is to use QM data on multiple websites as benchmarks for the performance of different sections of your website. For instance, if your online magazine has a cooking section and a fashion section, you can benchmark the cooking section against cooking websites and the fashion section against fashion websites.
You can also look at the changes over time in various metrics for the dimensions you are considering.

,


In particular, pewinternet.org, a project of the Pew Research Center, has conducted and published the results of many surveys of Internet use. This differs from GA and QM data in that it involves directly asking people how they use the Internet, rather than relying on tracking. The main advantage of these surveys is that they can probe into greater depth what is going on in people's minds as they interact with websites, and how they relate to specific websites as well as to the Internet at large.You might also be able to find studies specific to Internet use in the domain of interest to you.
You might also be able to use research on gender, age, and location differences in participation in various topics and communities (ranging from politics to gaming), including ones that are about offline behavior (i.e., not directly related to the Internet). One advantage of this is that you get a much wider field of research to use. A disadvantage is that the findings may not cross-apply fully to online behavior.

,

GA generally maintains a relatively high standard: GA displays only those metrics for which it can make high-quality predictions. Third-party sources have generally found GA's aggregate data (i.e., the overall proportions of visitors of various types) to match other trustworthy sources.On the level of individual impressions, GA may not be that reliable. For instance, a study by the Pew Research Center compared inferred gender used in Google Surveys (that uses the same methodology as Google Analytics) with self-reported gender, and found that inferred gender and self-reported gender matched for 75% of respondents.Overall reliability is higher than reliability on individual impressions because the errors mostly cancel out.
Other tools like QM (from Quantcast) and comScore's service are often less reliable, but offer a greater wealth of data. Quantcast and comScore maintain a large panel of users who enter detailed personal information. They track the behavior of these users, and build models correlating user characteristics (such as age and gender) with the websites they visit. They then use the models they build to study the cross-site behavior of other users outside their panel and classify those users' age, gender, and other attributes. The process is a series of sophisticated guesses that is biased towards rediscovering stereotypes (so that a man with feminine interests will be classified as a female). They are, however, still reasonable guesses that provide a starting point.,

One of the most important determinants of expected gender composition of a website is the topic or domain of the website. Domains range from heavily female-over-indexed (such as cooking and fashion) to somewhat female-over-indexed (celebrity news, pop culture, and feel-good stories) to somewhat male-over-indexed (politics news and technology) to heavily male-over-indexed (hardcore technology, gaming and sports).
A second determinant of gender composition is the format of presentation. This is a little tricky to understand because there are a number of mutually cancelling factors at play. As a general rule, a website based around transactions (such as a question-and-answer website) or impersonal discussion (such as an online topic-focused discussion forum) is indexed more on males, whereas a website centered around social interaction (in particular, sharing) would be indexed more on females, holding the underlying topic constant. Another general rule is around imagery: pictures of scantily clad women predict more male use, whereas all other kinds of pictures (including pictures of women that are intended to highlight their dresses or particular fashion choices, but also pictures of food) are more indexed on females. While these observations can be verified directly using QM data for a lot of websites (as documented below), there is also direct survey evidence based on survey data collected by the Pew Research Center, including data on Facebook use,Reddit use,social media use,and overall Internet use.The reasons for these disparities by gender are difficult questions of social science. It is not, however, necessary for you to fully understand the reasons. The exception might be cases where you are explicitly trying to cater to a counter-cultural niche.

The ""Your Fans"" option shows cumulative data on all people who have liked your page.

, Quantcast data on gender for large websites is generally reliable and agrees with Google Analytics data where both are available, so you can use QM data for other websites to benchmark. The gender compositions of websites by category are described below. In addition to references to QM, references to sociograph.io snapshots and other relevant discussions of the gender composition are also included.

Perhaps the most extreme gender ratios are seen on websites in the Stack Exchange network for technology communities, with the proportion of males ranging from 90% to 97%. This is because these websites combine two attributes favoring males: they are about technology and programming topics, where males are over-represented, and they use the Q&A format, which seems to elicit more participation from males.The annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey, which is advertised on Stack Overflow and in its Facebook groups, reports a similar gender ratio.The topic has also been the subject of third-party research.The gender disparity in technology occupations has been widely discussed, and you can learn more by searching the Internet about women in technology and women in STEM.Sports news and hardcore gaming websites tend to be heavily male-over-indexed, with the proportion of users that is male usually higher than 80% and possibly even higher than 90%.It's important to keep in mind that, in contrast to hardcore gaming, casual gaming has an almost even gender split, with a slight over-indexing of females.Pornography websites tend to be male-over-indexed, but not as heavily as you might naively think. For instance, leading pornography website Pornhub estimates that 24% of their visitors in 2015 were female, and also expects that the percentage of females viewing porn will increase over time.Real-time politics news websites (specifically, those dealing with national rather than local news) tend to get around 75% to 85% of their traffic from males. This may be attributed partly to the sports-like nature of politics news, and partly to the fact that males are over-represented in sectors such as politics and government lobbying where people need to keep track of real-time news.Gender differences in political participation and voting have been the subject of significant academic study and popular debate, with the names ""political gender gap"" and ""gender gap in voting"" used.Websites covering political and policy news tend to be male-over-indexed, though generally less so than the heavily real-time-focused ones. The percentage of males varies between 65% and 85%. The male skew tends to increase with the heterodox nature of the political and policy positions espoused by the website. For instance, policy-focused news and analysis website Vox is 70% male,whereas Reason, a libertarian magazine, is 84% male.Conservative news sites also tend to be more heavily male, partly driven by the bias towards older people and the fact that among older age groups, Internet use is more heavily male.However, even liberal sites, like Talking Points Memo, can be quite over-indexed on males.See the references for the preceding bullet point for more background.
Science and technology news websites tend to be moderately male-over-indexed, with the percentage of audience that is male being between 65% and 85%. Both the science/technology aspect and the news aspect tend to bias in favor of males, though neither bias is very strong.Humor websites tend to be between 65% and 80% male, even when the humor is not particularly gender-specific. Examples include The Onion, CollegeHumor,and The Chive.Image and GIF websites, that is not exclusively about humor but where the bulk of images have a humor angle, also serve as examples: Imgur,Gfycat,and Giphy.Mainstream news websites such as CNN and MSNBC are between 60% and 70% male.Local news websites (without a specific topical focus) are slightly over-indexed on females. Typically, between 48% and 65% of the users are female. You can get many examples by looking at Quantcast data for news website in the Tegna network, such as WBIR (East Tennessee),KSDK (St. Louis, Missouri)WHAS (Louisville, Kentucky),WZZMWUSA (Washington, D.C.),KTHV (Little Rock, Arkansas),and KXTV (Sacramento, California).Some examples that are not part of the Tegna Network include: KLRT-TV and KARK-TV (both owned by Nexstar Media Group working with Mission Broadcasting, and operating in Arkansas)newspaper websites under the Gatehouse Media Network such as the Holland Sentinel,and the Grand Haven Tribune.News/commentary websites that are explicitly female-focused can have anywhere between 50% and 70% audiences. An example is Jezebel.Academic websites at the early college or lower level tend to be somewhat over-indexed on females (with a composition of somewhere between 55% and 65% females, though it can vary a bit based on the choice of subject).Note, however, that for websites covering more advanced topics, the gender composition will skew in the direction of the overall gender composition of people studying those advanced topics. Also, Q&A sites, such as those on the Stack Exchange network, tend to be more heavily male.Celebrity news, entertainment news, and light-hearted entertainment websites tend to be moderately female-over-indexed, with the percentage of audience that is female being between 50% and 80%. An example is NBC.com, that is about 60% female.Another example is Soompi, an English-language website focusing on the happenings in South Korean drama, that trends 80% female.However, a celebrity news site that focuses more on pictures of scantily clad women, or semi-pornographic material, and less on gossip will tend to be more male-over-indexed. Presentation matters too: a website targeted at males will use words like ""hot"", ""sexy"" and ""girls"" or other objectification-loaded terms whereas one targeted at women will use ""beauty"", ""style"", or other agency-loaded terms when referring to female models and celebrities. For instance, a website such as The Chive or Uproxx will be male-over-indexed,whereas a more BuzzFeed-like website (such as Upworthy or LifeBuzz) will be female-over-indexed.Food consumption websites (not focused on recipes or cooking) can range anywhere from even (50% for each gender) to moderately female over-indexed (70% female) depending on the type of content.Cooking and home furnishing sites are likely to be heavily female-over-indexed, usually somewhere between 70% and 90% female. The style of the site is an important determinant in how extreme the female skew is.The online websites for women's magazines, as well as websites with tips for women, tend to be over-indexed on females.However, if the material is of general interest (such as tips on work-life balance), the over-indexing could be less pronounced.Fashion, style, and beauty sites are likely to be very female-over-indexed, with the proportion varying between 70% and 90%.,

In the United States, the number of male and female Internet users is approximately equal, so for the US as a whole, no adjustment needs to be made. However, in some other countries, such as India, Internet users tend to be disproportionately male (the skew could be partly misleading because of the use of shared computers between family members, that are registered in the name of a male member).In this case, rather than just looking at the percentage of users by gender, it is more helpful to look at this percentage adjusted for the overall percentage of Internet users. Quantcast's reports do so and call it an ""index""but Google Analytics does not report this number directly.
Different age groups might have different gender distributions of Internet users. In particular, younger age groups are likely to have a closer-to-equal gender ratio, whereas older age groups are more likely to skew male. However, this can vary by location so it's best to look up the data in your target audience.

, Look into the following:


Overall age composition of your website traffic and how it has changed over time.
Age composition based on referral type (""default channel group"" in GA parlance).
Age composition of people who have liked and engaged with your content on Facebook, using FBI.
Age composition of people who have viewed individual pages.

,


The ""Your Fans"" option shows cumulative data on all people who have liked your page.
The ""People Reached"" option shows data on people reached in the past 28 days (deduplicated, so even if a person is reached multiple times, that person is shown only once).

,

One reason is that a lot of Internet use is concentrated among people between the age of 18 and 34. Therefore, if you look at composition alone, you are likely to see that most of your site's users are within age buckets in this range. On the other hand, index (relative to active Internet users) can paint a different picture.
Another reason that index is more robust than composition is that the age buckets tend to be of different sizes, both age buckets used in the same analytics tool and age buckets across analytics tools. Therefore, even aside from the fact that people use the Internet to different extents at different ages, the comparison is not a fair one.

, Quantcast data on websites that have it available can be good for obtaining benchmarks.

In general, a site that is intended to target a workplace need is likely to be most over-indexed among populations of working age. Similarly, a site that is intended to target a student need is likely to be the most over-indexed among student populations. The age bucket with the highest indexing depends heavily on the occupation and the age structure of people in that work occupation or for that topic and level of study. Even subtle differences in specialty can lead to significant differences in the age composition. For instance, Stack Overflow and ServerFault are both sites on the Stack Exchange network targeted at people in the technology sector. However, whereas Stack Overflow is most heavily indexed in the 25-34 age group, ServerFault is most heavily indexed in the 35-44 age group. This reflects the somewhat greater age (possibly because of the requirement of more experience) of the target audience of ServerFault.(In addition to Quantcast data, we have the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data for Stack Overflow, though not for ServerFault, and this corroborates the QM data).Similarly, algebra.com, Math Stack Exchange, and MathOverflow are all sites that cater to academic mathematics, but the different levels of the subject that they deal with lead to them being most over-indexed in different age groups (< 18, 18-24, and 25-34 respectively).Politics news sites tend to be indexed higher on older age groups, with the indexing being highest on the 65+ age group. This includes news sites that report on politics news,and it also includes conservative politics news and discussion sites.However, even liberally slanted politics news and discussion sites, that are not targeted at a younger audience per se, are over-indexed on older age groups.The greater interest in politics might partly reflect older people using the Internet less for other purposes (including work, study, outdoors activities, and pop culture). There has been some survey research on the differences in the level and nature of political engagement between young and old people.Local news sites (associated with local TV stations and newspapers) are indexed higher on older age groups, but the indexing is not as strong as for politics news sites, and different types of local news sites might peak at different age groups. Some peak at the highest age group (65+) whereas others peak for the 45-54 age group.However, websites that cater to the developing world may be most popular among younger age groups, reflecting the greater age-based digital divide in developing countries.Sports sites tend to be most popular among middle-aged groups, specifically the 35-44 age group.Gaming sites tend to be most popular among younger age groups (< 18 or 18-24).Food consumption websites (not focused on recipes and cooking) are most over-indexed for the 25-34 age group and then the 35-44 and 18-24 age groups.Cooking and home improvement websites are most over-indexed for the 25-34 age group and then the 35-44 and 18-24 age groups.The popularity of celebrity news and entertainment sites among different age groups depends on a variety of factors. Those associated with brand names that are relatively old, and covering segments of celebrity news and entertainment that are more mainstream and established, tend to be a little more popular among middle-aged and older groups. In contrast, those dealing with newer forms of entertainment, or entertainment in other countries, tend to be more popular among younger age groups. For instance, the indexing of NBC by age group increases steadily till the 55-64 bucket,whereas Soompi (an English-language website about the South Korean drama scene) and HipHopEarly (a hiphop website) are indexed most heavily in the 18-24 age group.Fashion, style, and beauty websites tend to be mostly over-indexed toward the younger age groups (< 18, 18-24, 25-34). A typical serious, no-nonsense fashion site would be most over-indexed in the 25-34 age group.Sites targeted at younger audiences tend to be less exclusively focused on fashion but tend to mix fashion advice with other advice related to sex, relationships, and coming of age., Look into the following.

,


Unless your website gets a really huge amount of traffic, the data for cities other than the top few would be too noisy and unreliable. As a general rule of thumb, the number of top cities to consider can vary from 10 (for a moderately popular website that gets 1,000 or more pageviews a day) to 100 (for a very popular website that gets millions of pageviews a month). Also, use as large a date range as possible.

Within these top cities, control for the city's population (i.e., use index rather than composition) where possible. Quantcast uses the term affinity rather than index when reporting data for cities. The main difference between affinity and index is that whereas index is reported as being out of 100 (so an index of 100 means that the website is as popular with the sub-demographic as it is with the whole demographic, affinity is reported out of 1.
If examining your website's data using Quantcast, click on ""View Details"" to see all the values (affinity, composition, and index) for each of the global cities.
To get a sense of how well your top cities match the top cities in the world, you can use various lists of top cities and metropolitan areas. Depending on the analytics tool you are using, it might count all traffic from the metropolitan area (outside the city proper) as traffic from the city, or it might not.,

If using QM, use the ""View Details"" view to get more information on the top countries, including the affinity, composition, and uniques. After identifying the top countries, use the affinity metric to control for population and get an idea of the countries where your content is most popular per capita.

,

Websites whose topic of interest is specific to a particular region (for instance, covering local news, or local celebrities, or general stuff but mostly applicable within a narrow cultural context) the traffic to the website will be concentrated in that region. This effect is strongest for local news stations. For instance:

Consider news site WBIR that serves East Tennessee.The three most popular cities (in absolute terms, not just affinity) are Knoxville, Maryville, and Nashville, all Tennessee cities. In terms of affinity, all but one of the top 50 cities are in East Tennessee.
Consider news site WZZM that serves the part of Michigan from Grand Rapids to Kalamazoo.The six most popular cities in absolute terms are in Michigan: Grand Rapids, Muskegon, Detroit, Holland, Rockford, and Lansing. In terms of affinity, the top 100 cities by affinity are all in Michigan.
Consider news site WUSA that serves the Washington, D.C. area.The three top cities in absolute terms are in the Washington, D.C. area: Washington, D.C., Ashburn, and Manassas. The top 100 cities by affinity, excluding Washington, D.C. itself, are all in the nearby states of Virginia and Maryland. A similar story holds for NBC Washington.In general, the language in which a website's content is presented affects the geographical regions where it is likely to be used. For instance, English websites will be more widely used in English-speaking countries. However, this effect is less pronounced in cases where the topic deals with a particular niche (such as programming) where the userbase is international and English is the lingua franca of global communication.
For websites that focus on content relevant to people in particular occupations, the cities with the largest number of people in those occupations are likely to send the most traffic to that website. Similarly, the cities with the largest proportion of people in those occupations are likely to have the largest affinity for the website.
One rule of thumb is that in the United States, urbanization levels for high-skilled professions are lower than in Asian countries. In other words, you are likely to find people in small towns in the United States engaged in high-skilled professions. In contrast, in South and East Asia as well as Russia, almost all the people in high-skilled professions are concentrated in the cities or university towns. This means that it could well be the case that India, China, or South Korea has a lower affinity for a website than the United States does, but the top cities in these countries have a much higher affinity than the top cities in the United States.

,

Technology Q&A sites tend to have fairly global audiences, and (interestingly) report extremely high composition and index in a few Indian cities (Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Pune, and to a lesser extent, Delhi), Seoul (South Korea), Moscow (Russia), Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Shanghai, and San Francisco. Although major global cities such as New York City also contribute a large share of users, their affinity is relatively lower and for some sites, even lower than 1.Educational websites are a little trickier to predict. Some of them have global appeal, whereas others appeal only within specific territories, even if their content is global in principle. In general, websites that cater to people at lower education levels are likely to have more regionally limited appeal (because education at lower levels is more constrained by linguistic and cultural barriers, and minor differences in syllabi and notation, and there is also a larger plethora of online resources in different languages). Thus, for instance, the top cities for algebra.com (focused on middle-school and high-school mathematics) are all in the United States,whereas those for Math StackExchange and MathOverflow are more global in nature.Politics news websites have high affinity with the regions whose politics are the focus of the sites. Sites that cover global news, such as CNN, have a fairly global audience, although they are still concentrated more in the countries where they originated.In contrast, a site such as Politicoor Talking Points Memo,which is almost exclusively focused on United States politics, gets most of its readers from the United States. At the city level, the capital city would have the highest affinity among all cities (in the United States, this is Washington, D.C.).For global news websites such as CNN, capital cities across the world, as well as city-states such as Singapore, would have the highest affinity.For websites with coverage of restaurants, New York City, Seattle, Boston, and San Francisco tend to have the highest affinity among major cities. Since the cities other than New York City has a small population, it still ranks quite low in composition. The greater affinity of Seattle, Boston, and San Francisco may be explained by their greater ethnic diversity as well as their role as tech hubs, with a lot of the food-focused websites built by technology companies collaborating with restaurants.The older the site, the less heavy its affinity for new, tech-savvy cities.The appeal of fashion websites tends to be quite region-specific. For instance, a fashion website such as Refinery29 or the Zoe Report gets the majority of traffic from the United States (this is also one reason that fashion websites that aim for international audiences need to maintain different versions for the audiences in different regions). In general, fashion websites tend to have higher affinity on cities, even cities (such as Los Angeles) where most other websites have low affinity. However, the affinity is related more to income levels (and therefore more in cities with higher median incomes) than it is to our conception of how much the region has an interest in fashion (thus, for instance, San Francisco has a much higher affinity than Los Angeles)."

"
Get yourself a little bit familiar with HTML and web design in general.,
Consider who your website is for.,
Open your graphic editing program (this example uses Paint Shop Pro but there is also GimPhoto).,
Open up your web editor (in this example we use Front Page but there is also Kompozer and Sea Monkey Composer).,
Get one of your ""linked pages"" started.,
Go back to your frame set.,
Create the rest of your pages, and link them up the same way!,
Publish the page.",How to Make a Website Using a Web Editing Program," Check out http://www.lissaexplains.com. It's a great website for beginners and a fun and easy way to teach yourself HTML!;
, Ask yourself the following questions:

What kind of colors and/or graphics will fit your audience?
Are you entertaining or trying to do business?
Should the website be built for ease-of-use or design?

, Let's make your graphics first (or if you have your own already, skip to the next step).


To make a simple button, select New from the file menu. When the dialog box pops up, select 88 x 31 Micro Button from the Presets menu, or type in your own dimensions. Flood fill your button with your desired color, and add any desired text on now. Then go click the Effects menu, select 3D effects, and then Buttonize. You can mess around with the variables if you like, but once you're done, click okay, and viola. There is your button!
To make a matching divider, mess with the picture size dimensions until it's the size and length you want and do the same thing!
If you need backgrounds, search the web for royalty free images, there are tons of them out there.

, Your website likely has more than one page, so let's make a frames page as your index.


Select New from the File menu, If a Templates dialog does not open, check to your right, and select More page templates.






Click the Frames Pages tab, and find the one that suits you and your website. For this example, we'll use the Banner and Contents.






To adjust the frame sizes, drag near the borders where the little arrow pops up, until the size you want is reached. If you want to keep the frames as resizeable in the browser, leave them alone. Otherwise, right click on the page and select Frame Properties. Down the the bottom, uncheck where it says Resizeable and browser, and presto.






To set the backgrounds on your newly created pages, right click anywhere in the white and select Page properties. Click the Formatting tab and select either the color you want or the image you wish to use. Generally, your menu bar (or button links) are stationary in one or more of the frames pages, with the center page being the one that displays your linked pages.
To add your buttons, pick your menu page and select Insert, Picture, From File, and get it from your computer. Don't worry about linking right now, we'll get to that later.
If you want to get rid of the scroll bar, right click on the page, and select Frame Properties. At the bottom where it says Options, choose between Never, If Needed, and Always.
Add your homepage content. You may want to consider adding a link back to your homepage if there is any important information on it.
Name your frame pages. Right click anywhere on each page, and select Frame Properties. Right at the top is Name; name them whatever you want (i.e. home, menu, banner, etc.) Save everything, making sure that you name your Frame set index (index is the page that your browser will automatically link to when opening a website).

, Your linked pages are the pages that your buttons will be leading to. Select New and keep it a blank page; this will go inside the page you set as your homepage in the frame set. Add your content and save.

, To link a button to your page, right click on it, and select Hyperlink. Find the page you created for this button, highlight it, and on the right hand side, select Target Frame...From here, highlight the frame you want your page to be displayed in, and hit ok. Test out your link; right click on your button, and select Follow Hyperlink...if you did it right, you linked page will be displayed where your homepage was before! Sometimes, FrontPage can be goofy, so if that doesn't work, try linking to Parent Frame instead.

, To get links to open in a new window, do the same thing, only instead of selecting your home frame, select New Window.

, The FrontPage help file should explain it pretty well. Once you start doing this more and more, you'll find that all those things you thought you couldn't do, you can, and making really great websites will be a breeze. Check out the Layout land link for a great tutorial on how to create websites using iFrames and Macromedia Fireworks.

KISS.,
Optimization.,
Keywords in URL.,
Separators.,
Case preference.,
Folder structure.,
Sub domain vs sub folder.,
Post launch maintenance.","How to Structure User Friendly, Search Friendly Urls"," Keep it short and simple. Yes, this the first rule. When the web user views the URL it should convey the correct details like the page content idea, page hierarchy and more details. So remember to keep it short (so that it easy to remember), and simple (so that it is easy to locate).;
, Nowadays most advanced search engines like google considers URL as an essential criteria in search algorithm out of various other factors. For example an URL like www.domainname.com/1738.html will be considered as a less search friendly URL when compared to www.domainname.com/computer-parts/keyboard.html. As you can see the latter conveys the hierarchy of the page – the page talks about computer parts and specifically about keyboard. Also it is easier for the search engine crawling.

, Now taking the same example in Step 2, the second URL is rich in keywords. Keyword in URL is more search friendly. As you can see, the URL contains two major keywords, which are, computer parts and keyboard.

, While we have multiple words in the URL, for example, web development strategy, we need to use separators such as hyphens or underscores. /web-development-strategy.php. Here it is better to use hyphens than using underscores.

, Mostly it is a Myth that Uppercase alphabets attract more attention(pertaining to URL Framing). But it is advisable to use lowercase for all the alphabets in the URL. Keep this pattern uniform in all your URLs.

, When you have folders and sub folders, categorize them in an orderly fashion. For example when you talk about pet dog medicines you may categorize it as /pets/dog/medicine.html. You need to upload the folders in similar fashion. Also for the user, he knows which part of the website he is currently located.

, While creating blog for a website it is better to have it as a sub-folder (www.domainname.com/blog) rather than sub-domain(www.blog.domainname.com). A sub-folder is more search friendly.

, Once you are through with launching the website, keep monitoring the URLs or Links regularly. This will help you locate the broken links and thereby help in rectifying them then and there.

Incorporate SEO.",How to Make a Website for Your Business," Having a website for your business is crucial. Whether you have a large company that sells lots of merchandise, and you need an Ecommerce component, or you’re a small entrepreneur who sells items from your home. A business website promotes your company and allows customers a way to engage with you. Before you can build your website, decide what purpose it will serve. Ask, then answer the question: ""What am I selling?"" You may be selling products that are also in physical stores, online only, or a service you provide.
The primary product you sell should be what your website displays most prominently. People stay on web pages for an average of 15 seconds. You need to capture attention right away. Showcase your product as soon as your site page loads. If you sell clothing or furniture, consider placing a large slider towards the top of the homepage that showcases some of your best products. If you sell a service like construction and repair, or have a restaurant, consider a large image at the top that shows viewers what to expect from coming to you.Think like your customer. Ask yourself what you would hope to find from coming to a site like your's. Provide those solutions as soon as you can on your homepage.;
, If you are making your own business website, chances are you provide somewhat of a niche service, but you can take inspiration from larger companies’ sites.


Say you have a small design studio where you make and refurbish furniture. Look at the sites of larger, national companies to see how those sites look and operate. What kind of products are featured, how are the home pages are laid out, and are these sites easy to navigate?
Do these sites make it easy to find what you are looking for? Do they provide you with an enticing experience?
Pick out an item on another site and start making the steps to buying it. Take notes on how the checkout process works (You don’t actually have to buy anything).
Write down your impressions. Consider making two columns. One for aspects you liked, and one for those you didn't.

, Before you jump into actually making your website online, you want to create a wireframe.


Wireframes are simple sketches of your site layout that let you define the information hierarchy of your site.
You can make wireframes using specific apps like InDesign or Balsamiq Mockups, using shapes in a word application like Microsoft Word, or simply sketch on paper. , Look back at the other websites you’ve visited and think about what worked and didn’t work. You probably want an easy to see navigation bar at the top of your screen. A navigation bar will allow visitors to go to different pages of interest with ease. Links to products, different categories or services, an about section, and some contact information is useful. Think about including a nice header image above your nav bar. This is a featured graphic that showcases your products and provides a lifestyle image.
Below your navigation bar is the body of your page. This might include products in a grid, and some information about your company.
At the bottom of your page is a footer. This will include links to other pages like about or contact pages. You might want to include a map that shows where your business is located. A FAQ section, Terms of Use, and social media links.
While it’s a bit of a daunting process, you should sketch out the design of each of your pages.
The site I ♥ wirefames has tons of examples that can give you inspiration.As a general rule, put the most important information at the top and left of your site. English readers read left to right and top to bottom. When someone is scanning your page you want to provide the most pertinent info or products toward the top and left.

, You can design and build your website fairly easily without having to involve much code. However, hiring someone or asking a friend who knows how to build websites can really help you create a functional and great looking site.


If you’re not computer savvy, having a professional help you build out your design can help your business. The quality of design and functionality can mean the difference between a clunky site that people have a hard time using, and a site that generates sales.

, Now that you know the purpose of your website and its general layout, it’s time to buy a domain name and hosting service. A domain registrar is a service that allows you to own your site’s name and web address, and hosts your files on a secure server.There are plenty of services that offer a hosting service as well as tools to help you build a website.
Different services will be better for your needs depending on how comprehensive your site will be. If you have a small business, a VPS (virtual private server) gives you more resources and can store data more efficiently than a shared server.Don’t just go for the cheapest service. Sometimes more expensive services offer add-ons like website builders and third-party shopping cart plugins. Plugins can help you make a nice, operational site. Additionally, If you skimp on a service, you may encounter problems with your site crashing. Cheap services can contribute to long loading times, especially when there are a lot of visitors to your site. , You want to make your domain name something that’s not only easy to remember but easy to type. Keep your domain name short. Not only does a short name make it easy to remember, but it also makes it easy to type into a browser on any device.
Include a keyword that will help people find your site when searching for a particular product or service. Say you make and sell furniture, try combining your company name with the words “furniture” or “design”. If you already use those words in your company’s name, you’re on the right track.
Avoid numbers, hyphens, and hyperbole. Adjectives like “best” or “top” in your domain name make it sound fake and unreliable.

, A website builder, publishing platform, or CMS (content management system) are invaluable tools to build a website. You want a site that not only looks great and functions well, but which you can easily manage the content of. There are several platforms that range in capability and ease of use.


Squarespace is an all-in-one platform that lets you build a responsive site (meaning the site works on any size screen). You can drag and drop elements to your page layout, and host your site directly on Squarespace servers. In addition, there are features that let you optimize your search engine rankings, and host your online store. This site is geared more towards creative jobs such as photographers, designers, and writers.
Weebly is another option similar to Squarespace. Weebly lets you drag and drop to design how your site looks. There's also a toolbar to incorporate ecommerce elements, videos, and more. Weebly is a pretty intuitive platform that gives you a solid amount of freedom when designing the look of your site. It also has a good depth of navigation, allowing you as many drop-down menus and categories as you need. Drop-downs and categories are useful if you are selling a lot of products.Wix is another option which lets you build a site quickly. With a drag and drop style, plugins, and templates, Wix is very user-friendly. You can purchase a personalized domain name directly from your editor and host on Wix's servers. This builder is great for portfolios.
Wordpress is the most comprehensive CMS that’s full of themes, plugins, and customization options. If you are more familiar with coding, Wordpress is a good option as most themes let you edit the code. Depending on your technical ability, Wordpress allows you to build comprehensive websites that let you customize every detail down to the font. You can purchase themes and install plugins into your site to customize it. Ecommerce plugins let you set up your site for online purchases, and customize the checkout process. To really get the most out of Wordpress for your business, you will need the premium option. , Your customer has come to your website for a specific reason. You want to make it as easy as possible for your customer to navigate your site.


Put your popular products towards the top of your pages. Include easy to spot buttons so customers can add items to a shopping cart or see more information.
If you provide a service, outline what your service is. Provide a video and photos of your work. Include links or buttons to take visitors to pages that will provide further information. Consider a page or form that lets people easily request a service.

, Putting too much on a page and adding too many colors, illustrations, or pictures can hinder your site. Elements that don’t have a function will not only slow your site down, but frustrate people. Your business site is here to earn you money and give customers the easiest access to your products and services.


Stick to two or three colors. If you display your products in a grid, don’t make the background too busy or distracting. Think of a products page like a wall in a store. You want to showcase the products, the walls and shelves are just there to hold the products up. Perhaps you don't sell much, but provide a service like a barbershop. You don’t sell many products, but you need your website to book appointments and give viewers useful information. Think about including a video showcasing your shop and skills. Give viewers pricing tiers, and store hours towards the top of your site. Include a way for people to book appointments right on your homepage. Most site builders have plugins which perform these functions.

, Create separate pages full of content for each product or type of product you sell. Use keywords in your descriptions that readers might type in a search bar when looking for that particular product, or information on it. When selling a product, you want to provide useful information to your customers early. Explain what the product is made of, its purpose, and why your’s is different from all the other products out there.
When providing a service, include a description of what a customer will receive when purchasing your service. Explain pricing and pricing tiers.

, Page titles are sometimes used at the top of a page, especially on sites that sell many products. Titles will also show up in your navigation bar. A page title should simply tell viewers what is on that page.


If you sell clothes on your site, your page titles can be as simple as what item is clothing is on that page. If you have a page that showcases jeans, title that page ""Jeans"". If you have a sales or discounts page, title that page “Sales”.
If you provide a service, title your page with what that service is. If you repair AC units, then title the page that that provides information about AC repairs, “AC Unit Repair and Service”.

, Make more web pages for each new product that you carry or service you provide. Be sure to include text and images on those pages describing the product or service. Use words that people would likely use if they were searching online.


Update your web pages often. Add more information as needed. Update your product photos. You may even have to delete pages that are no longer applicable.
Avoid having web pages that only contain pictures. You should have some text that provides context to the page.

, Add links to your other pages. When referencing your home page, use keywords that you want your home page to be found by. Instead of just saying ""home page"" try and include your company's name. Add social media links and share content from your website to your social pages. For example, in your about page, link to your homepage when using your company's name. When discussing what kind of products or services you provide, link to those pages.
Consider adding a blogging component. Having a blog on your site is great for engaging with customers and building your search engine optimization. You can provide links to your pages, keep people up to date on new items or services, and share content.

",How to Make a Virtual Pet Site," To make a good virtual pet site, you can't just pull it out of thin air. While you could only focus your site on adoptables (images anyone can save and use in their signatures on other sites), you'll probably want an interactive website. That requires more than simply html and css.;
, While some ambitious people can create a website by themselves, most will need at least one other person to pick up the slack. You'll need to cover these areas of development: coding, concept, design, art, and possibly community.

, Most sites have humble origins, with a few basic features, and then make plans to grow after they've established a place on the web. You may want to consider these features:



Pets - Obviously, being a virtual pet website, you will need to create a pet system.

Public and private messaging - Allow users to congregate on a message board, with the option to privately message someone.

Currency system - Most pet sites have a currency system for one reason or another. It's either used to buy pets, or to buy items for one's pets.

Shops - Shops can sell pets, pet items, or even things that will grant users fun extras like access to a secret forum.

A game or two - This is extra, but it's always fun for users to have something to actually do besides collect pets. Some websites have no games, yet they thrive as well as the next pet site.

, You can use real life for inspiration or you can rely completely on your imagination to come up with some interesting and unique creatures. You should come up with several different types of pets to appeal to different types of users. Some like powerful and intimidating pets, while others simply can't get enough of the cute and cuddly.

, Back-stories aren't necessary, but they can draw in users who are interested in those aspects and make a creature seem more interesting. If you aren't good at drawing, draw a rough sketch and ask the artist of the team to shape it into a good rough draft.


Spend some time making up a world. Creating an original world is one of the most complicated parts, but also the most fun. Note down some ideas and get them to fit in with your world. If you think you might have seen the idea somewhere before, change it a bit!

, If you are not very good at art, this is the stage where you should take advantage of the artist of your team, or ask a friend who is good with computer art programs to help you create your image.

, You will want to figure out how, exactly, users will be able to do things on your website. Some things to keep in mind are:


How users will obtain pets. Are they going to be bought, found, or simply chosen from a list by the user and created?
How many shops there will be and what their purposes are. That's if you have shops, but again, many sites do.
What your users will be able to do with their pets. There are many features that can be coded into a pet site: battling, schooling, leveling, gaming, and dress-up are only a few of the things that could be done with pets.
How people can earn and spend the selected currency. Make sure that this is balanced.

, Now that you've got most of your website's details worked out, you're in a better place to create a name. You might use the name to indicate the site's main purpose (e.g. ""BattlePets"" or ""IntelliPets"") or just come up with a pretty name.

, A good host with a good domain name (a good domain name being one that doesn't look like ""yournamehere.hostingcompany.com"") typically costs money.

, A good site design will allow users to easily access important features without going out of their way or having to hunt it down. A well-organized menu can help users access most parts of the site on all pages and will reduce frustration.

, This part of the site will likely take coding, concept, design, and artistry skills. If you need help, invite people to join you!

, Rules are typically included in a website's Terms of Service, which is a legal virtual contract about how a website is to be used and what responsibilities lay on both the website owners and users. While a ToS can be written by one's self, it is recommended that a person versed in the law reads over it to make sure it is, in fact, legal.

, They can give you a perspective you don't have, and can let you know if something is broken or too confusing.

, After you've fixed everything and sorted everything out, it's time to get your site off the ground. It's wise to keep someone on hand at all times just in case something breaks.

, After you open, all that's left to do is maintenance and expanding. Come up with new games, new pets, and maybe even new worlds. Don't let your site grow stale, keep members coming back for more and more.

News and updates are a typical feature of homepages.
Once you have settled on the content, try to group similar items together conceptually.

, You can do this with a pen and paper. You can find resources, like HowStuffWorks.com, that will help you familiarize yourself with the terminology of web design and set reasonable expectations for the site's layout.


If you aren't overly creative, consider surfing the web in search of homepages that are similar to the look that you want to create. You will notice that homepages for different types of entities tend to follow certain conventions. For example, most university homepages have a nearly identical layout. This familiarity helps visitors navigate their sites.

, There are multiple options available to build the page itself.


Learn html, css and php, and write your homepage in a text editor. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) offers a variety of free tutorials.
Install a WYSIWYG (""What You See Is What You Get"") web authoring system.

You can find sophisticated (and not free) web authoring systems on the Internet, as well as some that cost less but may not operate as smoothly.
Hire someone to do the implementation for you. This could be very expensive, but it can free up your time and possibly help you sidestep the stress of designing the site yourself.

An Internet search for ""web hosting"" will lead you to a number of reviews and services. Companies like Network Solutions or Go Daddy will let you see if your desired domain name is available.

If you intend to do business through your website, you’ll need to make sure that the host supports online stores. If you want to create a wiki, there are a variety of free wiki hosts that specialize in creating and maintaining wikis. If you want a blog, blogging sites can get you set up in just a few minutes.;
, There are a lot of options out there; some great, some poor, some cheap, some expensive; so it's worth spending some time comparing features. Most offer limited services for free sites and typically place advertisements on your site. Your website will most likely also be a subdomain of the host site instead of its own site (e.g. yoursite.host.com instead of yoursite.com). Some of the more popular free hosting sites include:



Wordpress; great for blogs, small to medium-sized websites of all kinds

Drupal; great for medium to large-sized websites
Webs
Angelfire
Google Sites
Webnode
Wix
Wikia; great for wikis


, Each host will offer different services at the free level. Most hosts have a limit on how much data you can upload for your webpage, and this is typically very limited. This means that if you intend to have a media-rich site with images and video, you may not be able to effectively use a free site.


Different free hosts have different policies regarding creating online stores. If you intend to create an e-commerce website, ensure that the service you pick can adequately support your goals.
Most free hosts have low bandwidth limits as well. This means they don’t work very well as file hosts, as downloading files can quickly max your data allowance.
Check to see if the host allows you to upload your own websites. Most free services have web page creation tools and don’t allow you to upload your own custom code. This works for most basic needs, but if you want to be able to create your own site, make sure that the host allows it.

, Browse through the available pre-made themes (sometimes called 'templates' or 'styles'); you can use the software's own available themes, as well as browse theme-selling marketplace websites like Theme Forrest.


Many hosts have specialized designs for their sites that help maintain a brand identity with that host. Find the design that fits your website’s needs the most.

, Even if the service is for free, the business has to make money to provide it to you; it might use adverts, or it might try to entice you to upgrade to get more features, which might come at a significant monthly cost. Whichever one you choose, make sure you know how much it might cost in the future if you decide to upgrade to get more features.

, All free website hosts will require that you create an account. Depending on the service, you may not need to add any billing information unless you plan on upgrading to a paid account.

, Free websites typically allow you to create a subdomain on the host’s domain for free, and offer regular domains for a fee. Some free hosts allow you to connect a domain you already own to their free host.


You can buy top-level domain names (www.yoursitename.com) for yearly fees, and the connect that domain name to your free site. Be sure to check that your service allows this. Domain registration companies include GoDaddy, Register.com, Domain.com, Dyn.com, and many more.

, Almost all free website hosts have web site construction programs available through their website. These programs allow you to choose from pre-made themes, and some allow you to customize elements such as CSS.


Web page construction programs allow you to add your text and images with minimal fuss and have a functioning website up in a very short amount of time. Many let you simply drag and drop images into the site. Most require little to no coding experience.
Most free websites provide the tools to create your website online, without the need to download any editing programs. Since you are creating the site through their service, you won’t need to worry about using FTP programs and cPanel to upload content to your site.
Most services offer a variety of tutorials to help get your site up and running as quickly as possible.
If your web host allow it, you can upload your own HTML files to truly create your own custom website. To learn more about HTML coding, check out this guide. If you want to upload your own site, you will need to use an FTP program in order to access the server.

, You might need to tell your audience what you do or sell, why you do it (the story behind the business), how to contact you, and so on. Also plan ahead for fresh new content you'd like to add in the future.

, Once you are happy with the layout and content of your site, it’s time to open up for business! If you have a blog or announcement area, it’s a good idea to create a welcome/introduction post, explaining the purpose of the site and introducing yourself. This will help make readers feel more welcome when they visit the site, and give them a quick breakdown of what the site is for.

, Websites that consistently put out new and useful content will get visited much more often than sites that stagnate. Do your best to produce engaging content that brings the reader back for more. Stick to an update schedule so readers can get used to when new content will be available.


The number one way to increase traffic to your site is to consistently create good, engaging, original content. This will drive more viewers your way, and help to retain the viewers you already have.

, Check with your host to see if this is allowed, because many free hosts do not support ad revenue going to you when you are using free services. Placing ads on your site can help you monetize it, but may also deter people from reading your content if the ads are too intrusive.

, Once you have a complete website and are adding content on a regular basis, you can start advertising your site. You can pay to have your site advertised on other websites through programs like Google AdSense, or you can promote your site on your own through social media such as Facebook or Twitter.

, You can start by submitting your site to search engines. Search engines crawl the web, matching content on websites with users’ searches. To really start attracting large numbers of people to your site, you’ll want to submit it to all the major search engines. The process varies depending on the search engine, but almost all will require you to create a sitemap of your website first.


For Google, you can choose to just submit your site’s URL, or you can submit the entire sitemap for more optimized searches.
For Yahoo! Bing, you can submit just the URL, or submit your sitemap in a variety of different ways. Sitemaps should be in the XML format.

You won't typically have many options for customizing your page beyond a picture and profile information, but visitors can listen to your music, which is what is important. Best of all, you can link to this site on social media, etc. to share your music easily.



SoundCloud is one of the most popular options in this category.This service lets users host a large amount of music and allow visitors to stream it with a free account. Some global superstars (like, for instance, Lady Gaga) have SoundCloud accounts (or once did)., If you're looking for a good compromise between affordability and creative control, this is a good choice. A variety of online services allow you to build a personal website for free. This usually takes a little more work than creating a social media account, but it's still very easy compared to building a site from scratch. A major advantage is that you have more freedom when it comes to hosting content and choosing a unique site design.



WordPress is a free, popular choice for building sites and blogs.WordPress offers a variety of styles and design choices. Paying users get additional options, though free trials are available. Squarespace is another high-quality choice, though it is not free.

, This is by far the most labor-intensive option, but it offers your band total creative control. You will need a member (or a kind friend) who knows, at the very least, the basics of HTML coding. Python, JavaScript, and other web-friendly coding languages are also valuable. Note that you will probably need to pay for hosting even if you design your site from the ground up — running the servers for a website takes money.


Coding is an extremely deep topic that can't begin to be covered in this article. WikiHow has a wide variety of help articles on coding (see: our HTML article). There are also several free tutorials online. Codeacademy is probably the most famous of these., If you'd prefer to leave your website to professionals, you can be assured that there are numerous quality choices available. Web design agencies employ coders, visual designers, and content strategists to ensure your website is as professional and user-friendly as possible. However, this expertise comes at a cost, as this is generally the most expensive option.


There are many, many high-quality options available in terms of website design. One great idea is to meet with a well-reviewed designer in your local area. This way, you can work personally with the professional to get a finished product that's exactly how you want it.
Don't be afraid to shop around to get the right price. One e-commerce site found that the same site proposal earned bids from $3,000 to $32,000., The very first page your visitors see should tell them everything they need to know about your band without overwhelming them. Try to use pictures and succinct headers to convey this information, rather than dense paragraphs. Your home page should have at least the following:


The name of your band
A picture of your logo or the band itself
The name and/or artwork of your latest project
Easy-to-see links to other parts of the sites
One great example is the official site of Queens of the Stone Age. On www.qotsa.com, you are greeted with the name of the band, followed by the name of their latest album (...Like Clockwork). Both are in a large, eye-catching font. Artwork from the album takes up most of the screen. Links to tour dates, merchandise, and so on, are clearly arranged at the bottom., Conventional wisdom is that bands make most of their money from touring.Though this is now the subject of some debate, it's still absolutely crucial to have an up-to-date list of appearances and tour dates on your site. This can affect your bottom line: if your fans can easily find when and where you'll be playing shows, they'll be more likely to buy tickets and come see you. Be sure to update your list of dates immediately whenever changes or cancellations occur.


Rap group Run the Jewels has an example of a well-done gig list on its site.As of June 2015, the summer tour dates are up-to-date and arranged in clear, logical order. The group even gives the page a personal touch with a Blade Runner-spoofing tour poster above the dates.

, Most band sites let visitors listen to at least a song or two for free. If you're using a music-hosting site like SoundCloud, you can even put up entire albums for easy streaming. While you can put your music samples on their own page, another popular option is to have a music toolbar at the top or bottom of the screen that lets you listen while you view the rest of the site.


The Sub Pop Records page for experimental rap outfit Shabazz Palaces has a simple example of this. Scroll to the bottom of the page to find links to a few of the group's singles that can be played with one touch., Unless your band has a strong anti-commercial focus, it's not ""selling out"" to give visitors to your website an opportunity to pay you for your art. Many band sites have a ""Shop"" page where it's possible to buy music and merchandise like T-shirts directly through the site. It's also a good idea to have links for buying tickets. However, because this is almost always handled by ticketing agencies like Ticketmaster, etc., these links usually lead to external sites.


The official site of Ariana Grande takes this to its logical extreme with a large link to buy Grande's music on the front page. There is also a link to a shop where visitors can buy posters, apparel, and so on in the navigation bar at the top., This isn't quite as important as the things mentioned above, but it is a nice touch that can make your site seem a little more personal. Having a separate section for one (or all) of the following can provide extra content for fans who want to experience as much of the band as possible:



Bio: Who is in the band? What did the members do before it formed? When did the band start? How did it start?

Photos: Here, you may want to include concert photography, publicity pictures, candid snapshots, and more.

Behind-the-scenes content: Consider posting a few videos from the tour van, scans of setlists, original drafts of lyrics, and so on.

, Your band's website should also make it easy for visitors to find other sites that they might logically enjoy or want to visit. This will vary from band to band, but a few ideas are below:



Social media profiles: If you have a site and a profile on Facebook, etc. (which you generally should), linking from one to the other makes it easy for your fans to access more band content.

Digital marketplace pages for your music: If your music is available on iTunes, Spotify, etc., linking to it on your site can funnel fans toward it and make you a little extra money.

Related bands: If your members have side projects or there are other bands that you regularly associate with, linking to them on your site is a nice courtesy.

, Though the exact figure is hard to count, experts believe at least one in four people worldwide use social media in some form.This enormous global audience makes it wise to have at least one social media account for your band (as mentioned above, Facebook is the most popular site by far). People spend lots of time on social media, so frequently updating your profile will ensure fans who are following your page will be exposed to you often.


Some musical artists stay visible on social media by commenting on current events, participating in hashtag trends, and sharing content that they enjoy. Others take a more hands-off approach, only updating their profiles when new music, videos, or tour dates are released. The former choice will get you higher visibility, but you'll need to put some thought into your posts to avoid annoying or offending your online audience.

, Submitting your music to online music publications for review is a good idea — a positive review can drive traffic to your site and introduce new fans to your music. Once your band gains a high profile, you may even be lucky enough to be the subject of a writeup on a popular music site like Pitchfork or Stereogum.


Some music and arts sites occasionally have bands participate in interesting or funny segments, which can be a great way to boost your image. For example, the A.V. Club's Undercover feature has bands perform covers of songs chosen by users., Statistically, nearly all search engine users click on links from the first page of results. One Google study found that the first two results got about half of all traffic, while the top result on the second page only got about 1%.One sure-fire way to get your site to the top of the search results is to pay to have it promoted there. For example, sites like Google Adwords offer a wide range of promotional options.Today, many sites use a technique called SEO (or Search Engine Optimization) to appear as high as possible in unpaid search results. See our SEO article for step-by-step instructions for optimizing your site.

, One way to get publicity for your band ironically has nothing to do with music or touring. Making content like funny videos will boost your online presence if it gets shared widely. There's no ""right"" way to do this, so see our article on making a viral video for lots of great ideas!

Test the gateway.",How to Integrate a Payment Gateway Into a Website," The payment gateway processes the customer's credit card information by sending the data to the gateway's web server, which then makes the sale and sends the confirmation back to the website. You can quickly integrate your gateway into your website's shopping cart software.;
, Your web host or online shop software provider may provide payment gateway services that you can quickly implement on your suite. Check your website's control panel or your online shop's admin page to see if there are payment gateway options.

, There are a lot of different payment gateways out there, and they can get a bit confusing. Before you start looking, check which gateways your shopping cart software supports. Your shopping cart software's support site should have a list of compatible payment gateways. Some of the more widely supported gateways include:


PayPal
Payza
Perfect Money
Egopay
SecurePay
Authorize.net
Verify
Braintree
SecurePay

, The payment gateway will typically charge you a one-time setup fee, a monthly fee, and then charge a small fee for each transaction processed. Compare rates to find the service that meets your needs the best.

, External gateways (also known as ""redirect"") send your customers to another website to process the payment. Direct gateways (also known as ""transparent"") do the processing within your store, keeping the customer on your site. If possible, choose a direct gateway, as they look more professional.

, You will need to sign up for a merchant account, which you then link to your payment gateway. This will allow you to receive payments from the customer. Merchant accounts will typically charge you per transaction as well.

, Once you sign up for your gateway, you will be provided the necessary information that you will need to provide to your online store software.


This could be a login name and password, or it could be an ID and an authorization file.

, Most online retailers will use third-party software to create a web shop for their customers. This software handles the creation of the ordering page as well as all the code for transferring payment information to the gateway. Creating this code from scratch is one of the most difficult tasks when it comes to web development, so it's usually best left to professionals.

, The process for this will vary from service to service, but generally you will need to enter your payment gateway information for each method of payment you intend to accept (Visa, Mastercard, etc.). Your payment gateway determines which cards are accepted.You can do this from your online store's administration page. Find the Payments page, or something similar.

, you will typically be provided Test or Sandbox accounts by your payment gateway service. These allow you to perform fake transactions to ensure that the payment process is working correctly. Be sure to test before making your store live.


This will vary again from service to service. Check your payment gateway's support site for details on testing your gateway's integration.

Look for areas of the market that experience growth.,
Once the market which is experiencing online growth is pin-pointed, think of high-class domain names that have unspectacular web presence.,
If you come across a really good domain name with a dying website, you possibly hit the jackpot since the owner is no longer interested in maintaining the investment and will likely sell at a good price.

,
Put together a short plan on how you or your team will improve the site, or even consider tearing down the entire site and building a new one.

,
If you see potential for a profit, make an offer to purchase the domain name from the owner.

",How to Invest in Fixer Upper Domain Names," For example, if real estate is booming hot, then real estate domain names will be also increasing in value.;
, Check the domain name auctions such as Sedo.com to see if any domains in that market range are for sale, and make a bid. Today’s domain economy is extremely ""SELL"" based, so you might get away buying a top-notch domain for a really low price.

Assume you need permission to post.,
Check if the person submitting the image really owns it.,
Draft a permission form.,
Get signed permission before posting.,
Pay a licensing fee, if necessary.",How to Legally Post Submitted Photos on Your Website1," You might receive photographs from many different sources. For example, a friend might ask you to post a photograph. Or someone might submit a photograph claiming the image is in the public domain. You should always assume you will need permission., Someone might steal someone else’s image and then claim to give you permission. However, if they stole the image, then they can’t give you permission to use it. You should double check that the person submitting the image is the true owner.


You can ask for details, such as when the picture was taken and where.
You can also check to see if the image has already been posted online. Save the image to your hard drive. You can go to Google Images and then click on the camera icon in the search bar.Paste in the image URL or click on “Upload an image” and click on browse. If you see that the image has appeared elsewhere under someone else’s name, follow up with the person who submitted the photo.

, You should have a permission form that you can have the person who submitted the image sign. You can send it by email and they can sign it by typing their name and returning the release to you. Though oral permission is acceptable, especially if you know the person, something in writing in best.The release should contain important information:your name
your contact information
the website where you want to post the picture
identification of the work you want to use (such as its title or a description)
why you want to use it (e.g., to display on your website)
how you will use it on your website
how much you are willing to pay, if anything

, Wait until the person claiming to be the copyright holder signs and returns the permission form. At that point, you can publish the image online. Be sure to hold onto your signed permissions and store them in a safe place.


You might also want to keep an electronic copy of each signed permission.
Also write down other information, such as how you actually used the work and any conditions the copyright holder put on your use., Some copyright holders won’t let you post an image unless you agree to pay for a license to reproduce the work. You should know this before you post anything. The fee can be based on many different factors:the number of visits per your page
the number of hits per page
where the page is located on the website (such as whether it is the home page or a page deep in the website)
whether your website is informational or commercial

Remove the image if someone complains.,
Contact the person who submitted the photo.,
Avoid claiming “fair use.” Fair use is an exception to copyright law, which is actually fairly narrow.,
Talk with an attorney if you have questions.",How to Legally Post Submitted Photos on Your Website2," You might receive a complaint that you are using an image without permission. For example, the person who submitted the photo might have stolen it from someone else. You should immediately remove the image as you investigate.You can always put the image back up if, after a thorough investigation, you believe you are using the image legally.
Courts look favorably on someone who is responsive to complaints. If you simply ignore a complaint, then you could be digging yourself a deeper hole.

, After removing the image, you should contact the person who submitted the image and tell them you received a complaint. Also tell them that you removed the photo. If you want to continue posting the image, you should ask for proof that the person who submitted the image actually owns it.


For example, you could ask for a copy of their copyright registration.
Of course, someone doesn’t have to register with the Copyright Office to have a valid copyright. However, you might not want to risk continuing to use the image if you are unsure as to who owns it.

, Some people wrongly think they can reproduce anything they want but protect themselves by claiming fair use. Instead, fair use is a vague concept that applies only in certain situations, especially when your use of the photograph is “transformative” (i.e., you don’t simply repost it).You probably shouldn’t post a picture on the grounds of “fair use” unless you have talked with an attorney. An attorney can analyze the fair use factors and decide if you have a strong case for using the image.

, Copyright infringement can carry steep penalties, and you are better off getting professional legal advice before you do something that could expose you to a lawsuit. You can get a referral to an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Schedule a consultation and ask how much it will cost.
At the consultation, describe your situation and explain how you want to use the image.

Search for public domain images.,
Use images with open content licenses.,
Read the terms and conditions.,
Proceed with caution when using portraits.,
Respond promptly to complaints.",How to Legally Post Submitted Photos on Your Website3," When an image is in the public domain, it is not protected by copyright law. Because no one owns the copyright, they can’t stop you from using the image on your website. There are many image depositories on the web that offer public domain images. However, keep the following in mind:


An image might be “royalty free” but not in the public domain. Instead, the owner could put use restrictions, such as limitations on how often the image can be reproduced.
Many depositories that host public domain images also host copyrighted images.You should be careful as you look through the images and not assume that all images in the depository are free to use.
An image does not need a copyright notice attached to it to be under copyright protection.Ever since 1989, photographers do not have to put copyright images on their pictures in order to secure their copyright.

, An open content license, such as a Creative Commons license, allows you to use a work without explicit permission. You can find images in the following places:Flickr. Users can share images on Flickr under a Creative Commons license. However, be sure to check that the poster actually selected Creative Commons license.
Open Photo. This website as a selection of stock photos., You want to make sure that you have permission to use the images on your website.

Be sure to read the terms and conditions of the “clickwrap” agreement.Clickwrap agreements often pop up before you click a purchase or download button. You should print off any agreement and keep it for your records.

, Some images of recognizable people might be in the public domain. However, you should be careful before using those images in a commercial manner. If the person is still living and recognizable, you might be violating their right to publicity.The right to publicity is separate from copyright. Essentially, everyone has a right to prohibit others from exploiting their likeness for commercial purposes.

, It’s always possible that a depository claims an image is in the public domain when the image is copyrighted. If someone reaches out to you claiming they are the copyright owner, you shouldn’t just blow them off. Instead, you should remove the image and then investigate if you want to continue to use the image.

Improve the structure of your URLs :


Simple-to-understand URLs will convey content information easily, Creating descriptive categories and file names for the documents on your website can not only help you keep your site better organized, but it could also lead to better crawling of your documents by search engines.,
Create a simple directory structure, and Avoid having deep nesting of sub-directories like "".../dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4/dir5/dir6/page.html"", using directory names that have no relation to the content in them.

Think out your navigation based on your homepage, All sites have a home or ""root"" page, which is usually the most frequented page on the site and the starting place of navigation for many visitors. Unless your site has only a handful of pages, you should think about how visitors will go from a general page (your root page) to a page containing more specific content.

,


Create a naturally flowing hierarchy, and Avoid creating complex webs of navigation links, e.g. linking every page on your site to every other page
Use mostly text for navigation instead of Flash or any other means.
Put an HTML site map page on your site, and use an XML Sitemap file. If possible use a 404 error page.

Find the domain-name registrant using “WHOIS Lookup.” Before you can legally challenge someone for owning a domain name, you need to know the identity of the domain-name holder.,
Make sure you have trademark rights in your name.,
Send a cease and desist letter.,
Negotiate to purchase the domain name.,
Draft a contract if you purchase the domain name.",How to Legally Dispute a Domain Name1," This person is the “registrant.” You can find the registrant by visiting www.whois.net.At the website, type in the web address and click enter. You will then be able to see the name of the registrant.
Write down the registrant’s address, since you will need to contact him or her.
If the name is protected, then you must contact the registrar with whom the domain-holder registered the name. You will then have to work with the registrar to gain access to the name of the registrant.;
, You can legally challenge the domain name if it is your trademark. You can’t challenge a domain name if you would just like to have the domain for yourself. You need to have legal ownership of the trademark.


You will have rights to the trademark if you were the first to use it in commerce.It is not necessary to have registered the trademark to have rights in it. Instead, you must use it to sell your goods or services.
Ideally, however, you will have registered your trademark with the federal government. By registering the mark, it is easier to prove in a lawsuit that the trademark is yours. Also registering the mark is required before you can sue in federal court.
If someone has registered your trademark, then you would have to bring a lawsuit to cancel the person’s trademark by showing that you were the first to use it in commerce.You should consult a lawyer if someone else has already registered your trademark.

, Send this letter before suing. In the letter, you will tell the domain-name holder that you own the trademark. You also should tell the domain-name holder to stop using the domain name, otherwise you will have to bring legal action.


The domain-name holder might not stop using the mark. However, he or she might sell it to you. You should consider buying the domain since doing so might be cheaper than bringing a legal challenge. Challenging the owner using arbitration can cost $1,000-2,500 in fees.A lawsuit in court would cost even more.
Be sure to mail the letter certified mail, return receipt requested. Hold onto the receipt, since this is proof that the letter was received.

, If the domain-name holder is open to selling you the domain, then try to negotiate a good price. You can negotiate entirely through the mail. Once the domain-name holder sends you a purchase price, you can counter-offer for a lower amount. Before negotiating, you should consider the following:


The ideal amount you would like to pay. This is your goal, which you should negotiate toward. Look at your budget and see what you can afford.
The maximum you are willing to pay. If the current domain-name holder won’t come down and meet that number, then you should break off negotiations. This is called your “walk-away” point., You want everything to be transparent, so draft a valid legal agreement for the sale of the domain name. You and the current domain-name holder should both sign it. You might also want to show it to a lawyer before giving it to the other party to sign.


The domain-name holder will have to contact his or her registrar to transfer the name.You should hold off on sending payment until you get proof that the name has been transferred to you.

Decide if arbitration is right for you.,
Find an arbitrator at the ICANN website.,
Download a model complaint form.,
Select your type of dispute.,
Explain how the marks are “confusingly similar.” You cannot legally challenge the domain name unless you show how it is “confusingly similar” to your trademark.,
Explain why the domain-name holder has no rights in the name.,
Specify why the domain-name holder has acted in bad faith.,
State your remedy.,
Pay your arbitration fees.,
Wait for the domain-name holder’s response.,
Receive a decision.",How to Legally Dispute a Domain Name2," In arbitration, a private person (called the “arbitrator”) will act like a judge and listen to your dispute. The agency that oversees domain-name registration has created an arbitration process you can use to dispute the use of a domain name. You can only use this arbitration process if the domain-name holder is cybersquatting. If you win, you can get rights to the domain name.Cybersquatting is the practice of buying the domain names of businesses and then selling them to the business for a profit.For example, a person might notice that a new company in their home town is growing rapidly. This person then buys a domain using the company’s name for the sole purpose of selling it to the company. This is cybersquatting.
If the domain-name holder is not cybersquatting, then you will need to file a lawsuit. For example, the domain-name holder may actually be using the name on an active website. This is not squatting, though it could be trademark infringement.
You also shouldn’t use arbitration if the domain-name holder’s infringement has cost you money. Arbitration panels are not empowered to give you compensation. If you think that you have lost money because the domain-name holder is using your trademark, then you should bring a lawsuit in federal court instead.Online arbitration is relatively cheap and quick—about 57 days.This is much faster than a lawsuit. If time and money are important factors for you, then you might want to bring an arbitration.

, ICANN stands for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. This corporation is in charge of domain registration throughout the world. It has established a Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, which you can use to challenge someone’s ownership of a domain.If you win your arbitration, then the company that registers the domain (the “registrar”) will switch ownership to you.


ICANN also approves a list of arbitrators you should choose from if you want to arbitrate. You can find a listing by visiting their website.You can click on one of the approved arbitrators in order to submit information and start the arbitration process.

, You can submit your complaint electronically through the arbitrator. However, each arbitrator approved by ICANN also publishes model complaint forms. You can download this form and use it to help you gather necessary information for filing your complaint. After downloading the form, you should gather the following:your contact information, including name, address, telephone number, and email address
your preferred contact
the registrant’s contact information, including name, address, telephone number, and email address
the disputed domain names
the contact information for the registrar
information about your trademarks or service marks, including the goods and services for which the marks are used

, At the National Arbitration Forum website, for example, you start by clicking on “File a Claim” at the top of the page.On the next page you will see a drop-down box. You should select “Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) Case.”


You will then be taken to a screen where you can input information about your dispute.

, This is a factual test. For example, “zarpo” is not confusingly similar to “targee.”


However, if the domain name is identical to your trademark, then it would be confusingly similar. Also, if the domain name incorporates your trademark, then it is also easy to show that the domain name is confusingly similar to your trademark.
For example, your trademark may be “zarpo.” A domain name “zarpo.com” or “onlinezarpo.com” uses your trademark as its domain name. Therefore, the domain name is confusingly similar to your trademark.

, You can’t legally challenge the domain name unless you can meet this element. A domain-name holder will not have any rights or legitimate interests if he or she is not using it as part of a bona fide offering of goods or services.For example, you can prove this element if the domain name leads to a blank website, with no goods or services being sold on the website.
However, so long as the business is making preparations to offer goods or services, then it will have legitimate interests in the domain name.

, “Bad faith” is the third element you must convince the arbitrator of. Specifically, you need to argue that the domain-name holder did not register the domain for a legitimate purpose. Instead, it attempted to do the following:It registered the domain name for the primary purpose of selling it to you or to a competitor. If there is no content at the website, then this is proof that the primary purpose of obtaining the domain name was to sell it, not use it.
It registered the domain name to prevent you from using it or to disrupt your business.
It used the domain name for commercial gain because consumers would be confused and think they were visiting a website related to your business.

, You need to tell the arbitration panel what you want them to do. This is your “remedy.” You have two options: have the domain name registration cancelled or have it transferred to you.


If you choose simply to have it cancelled, then someone else could register it at a later date. Accordingly, you are probably better off requesting that the name be transferred to you.

, Arbitration isn’t free. Your fee amount will depend on whether you are having a one-person or three-person panel hear your arbitration. Generally, you will have to pay $1,300, which is the standard cost of a one-person arbitration.You should be able to pay electronically, at the same time that you submit the information in your complaint.

, After you submit your complaint, the arbitrator will contact the domain-name holder, who must file a response to your complaint. The domain-name holder has 20 days to file an answer.You will have the option to file a reply within five calendar days, although you do not have to. You should file a reply if the domain-name holder made false statements which you can quickly correct.

, Arbitration is a fast process. Unlike in a lawsuit, there is no fact-finding period or court appearances, which slows down the process and increases the expense. Typically, the arbitrator will rule in 14 days.If you win, then you should get the domain transferred to you within 10 days of the decision.

Analyze whether to sue in court.,
Think about hiring a lawyer.,
Gather evidence for your trial.,
File a complaint.,
Prove that the domain name causes confusion.",How to Legally Dispute a Domain Name3," Suing in court is an expensive and time-consuming process. It can also be ineffective, especially where the domain-name holder does not live in your country. If all you want is to cancel a domain registration or transfer the domain to you, then you should use arbitration. However, you might want to sue in court in the following situations:


The domain-name holder is using the trademark as part of a legitimate business. Sometimes people are unaware that they are using a trademark that has already been registered. In this situation, you can’t use arbitration because the person isn’t cybersquatting. Instead, you will need to sue for trademark infringement in court and prove that you were the first to use the trademark.
You are suing for lost profits. In addition to transferring the domain to you, a court can award you damages for any lost profits or for defamation of your business. You can only get these damages from a court., You should think about hiring a lawyer to bring a trademark infringement lawsuit in federal court. The rules of federal court are very complicated and can be hard to learn on your own. Accordingly, you should find a lawyer to represent you. You can get a referral for a qualified trademark attorney by visiting your local or state bar association.


After you have a referral, you should call and schedule a consultation. At the consultation, you can explain your situation. The lawyer can advise you about the strength of your case.
You may be worried about attorneys’ fees. Trademark infringement lawsuits are very expensive, and can cost upwards of $120,000. However, in federal court you can win attorneys’ fees if the infringement was very clear. You may also be able to get triple damages.The availability of attorneys’ fees and triple damages could put hiring a lawyer within reach. Discuss your options with the attorney at your consultation. If you do not think you can afford a lawyer for trial, then think about buying the domain name or pursuing arbitration.

, You will need evidence in order to successfully sue the defendant. Gather the following pieces of evidence, which will help show the judge that the domain-name holder is infringing on your trademark:


a copy of your trademark
the certificate of registration (if your trademark is registered)
printed pages showing the website at the registered domain
any communications with the domain-name holder, such as letters or emails
evidence which shows that consumers are actually confused and think the domain name relates to your business, Your lawyer will start the lawsuit by drafting a “complaint” and filing it in federal court. This is a legal document which identifies you and the domain-name holder and explains the facts surrounding the lawsuit.You also request that the judge award you the domain name and money compensation.


For additional tips, see File a Federal Lawsuit.

, The key to a trademark infringement lawsuit is that the defendant’s use of the mark likely causes consumer confusion. You should point to the following factors when arguing that there is a likelihood of confusion:the mark is similar to the domain name
your goods and services are similar or related to the goods or services offered by the domain-name holder
consumers are confused, as shown by emails or letters sent to you
the defendant adopted the mark in bad faith or to cause confusion
your trademark is strong (i.e., very distinctive)

",How to Get Free Website Templates," This is usually the easiest part of starting the website template search process. If your business is Accounting, you might choose a business template. If you are an artist, then maybe an artist's template. Whatever you decide, it's best to begin right here.;
, Choosing your colour scheme is important as it will help brand your design to your hobby, product or service. If you are in health care, you might want to choose green as it is a ""healthy"" colour. Finding a good colour chart will certainly help and there are plenty online. If you have a logo for your business or your niche, what are the colours? It's best to stay within your colour scheme to make the site more palatable and congruent with your design.

, We know there will be one main page, usually titled ""Home"" or ""Main"". But there are other pages that you may need such as, ""About Us"", ""Who We Are"", ""Our Products"" and ""Contact Us"". Writing down the names of these pages will help in your choice of template as some only include a single page while other may include a number of inner pages.

, Also known as ""text""; your copy is what you have written about each page. Whether it's ""About Us"" or even a ""Contact Us"" page - each page needs its own ""copy"" to stand apart from the other pages. This will tie in to your Search Engine Optimization (SEO - more about this further down) of each page to aid search engines in locating your work to display for their users.

, You have all of your information ready and can now search for the perfect template... but what search terms do you use? A good suggestion would be ""free web template"". Or, if your business was accounting, you would search for ""free business templates"" or ""free accounting template"". Keeping the search to no more than three words is preferable. The search engine you use will bring up the best links for your search term - but lets not forget there are a few more pages - it's best to inspect them all. Some new websites that offer great new templates might not be on page one, so it's best to do some due diligence to find great work. As well, some of the sites that come up on the first page typically have older designs on them. In our example, we'll visit WebTemplex.comfor free websites.

, You have now found your design and have downloaded it to your computer. A suggestion would be to create a new folder to store the site in and to work from. You would hate to have the website and all the files sitting in your documents folder scattered around with other files. It's best to keep everything together. Once you have the site file downloaded it will probably be in a zip file. A zip file contains all of the documents, images and code all compressed in a tidy file. You will need an unzip utility such as Jzip or Winzip to ""unzip"" the file and extract the files to your new folder.

, Quite simply you will double click on the file and the appropriate unzip software will load. This is based on your decision of unzip utility. It will open and show you the files it has within it. You can click on any number of files and drag them to your designated folder. They will instantly decompress once placed. Remember to save this zip file in a safe place in case you need to get an image or other file from it.

, Files Unzipped - Now Let's Build - for some, this scares people. You can't really hurt or ""mess up"" a website. In fact, everything you do only enhances it from this point. The files you will be editing will normally have the following file extensions: .html, .htm, .php, .shtml. For simpler sake, let's believe you are using an .html file. You will need something to edit the files with. By editing we mean that you will be entering your ""copy"", phone numbers, address - etc - on to the page. You can use Windows Notepad to edit the file and it really does a simple job - although the back end may look scary... if you read through the lines while looking at an image of the site you can start to get a feel for what each line means. Especially when you see text placement. There are other commercial HTML Editors on the market and they all do pretty much the same job as Notepad, just a tad more expensive.

, As stated in Step 8 above, you'll open the file in Notepad by first starting the Notepad programme. You'll then click on ""File"", and then ""Open"" and browse for the first file to edit. The very first file you will edit will be index.html. So, with the file open in Notepad, you will take your copy, or other info and place it into the blocks provided or where other text resides. The other text on a template site may seem like a strange language, ""lorem ipsum..."" this is simply garble language used on most templates. Finding the location of the spot to add your text, simply type in what you want it to say and save the file. You can always click on the .html file and your browser will open showing you what it looks like after you made any changes. If when you open your file it appears distorted, simply go back and undo the changes - this is a great learning experience!

, While you are writing your copy into your files keep in mind that the copy must be different than the copy of the other pages. If all pages had the same copy on them, your site would not garner the attention it would normally get. Each page must stand alone like it was its own website. You'll also use what are called ""Keywords"" within your writing to describe the page as it matches the text. For instance, this page could use the keywords, ""website template"". If your business was accounting then you would certainly add in the keywords, ""accounting"", finances"", ""taxes"" etc.

, Once you have all of the files the way you want them it's time to upload them to your host. This is often referred to as FTP'ing, or uploading. This is the process of taking all of the images and files and uploading them to your host. You will simply start your FTP programme and sign in to your web hosting account. Most FTP software allows you to transfer files much like transferring files in windows; where you select a file and drag and drop it into another folder. This new folder is actually the server where your domain is being hosted.

Start an email account.,
Go to the URL www.dot.tk.To date, the only completely free domain type you can acquire are "".tk"" domains.,
Choose a domain name.,
Follow through the registration details.,
Test access your site.",How to Get a Free Domain1," If for whatever reason you do not already have an email account in your name, now's the time to start one. You will need an email address to register a domain.The options for free emails are numerous, although Gmail is arguably the best for this purpose.


Password and email security is always important, but it's made even more vital if you're associating your email with a new domain name. Any hacking onto your email could lead to your domain being compromised, among a great many other bad things.;
, TK domains are sponsored by Tokelau, a small country in the South Pacific, largely as an investment to spread awareness about the country and attract tech ventures.These are very simple and easy to get, and you can attach them to existing addresses if you wish. The TK website is specifically intended for users to register free domains.


You will only be able to get the .tk domain if you insist on getting one freely. Paid domains may be registered at sites like GoDaddy., Choosing an address for your website is extremely important, and requires a bit of creativity. So many domains have already been picked out, and you'll need to choose something that's both relatively easy to remember and applies to the theme or content of your website.You can check availability of certain URL domains. Don't be discouraged if the first few you think up are already taken.Anyone potentially using your site should have an idea as to its contents based on the domain name.

, On the TK server page, you will be asked to go input details of your domain, including your email contact info and chosen domain name, among other things. The process itself is quite straightforward and should not take you more than a couple of minutes to fill out entirely. Once the info is inputted to your satisfaction, complete the registration with your TK account. Your site should be up shortly thereafter, although you may have to wait up to 48 hours depending on the traffic they're handling at the time., When the registration goes through, it's a good idea to give the domain name a test run to make sure everything's gone through without a hitch. Type the chosen .tk URL into your address box and see how it goes. If it takes you to the website you assigned it to, the registration has gone through successfully and you now have a free domain to work with.


Give it some time. TK domains can take up to 48 hours to come online following your registration. Don't assume the worst if you can't find it right off the bat.

, For example, if your web pages feature products that your visitors can purchase, place the ""checkout"" link at the top of your web page so the link is displayed clearly to your visitors.

, This will help encourage your visitors to spend time on your website; whereas if the colors of your background and text is too difficult to read, your visitors will most likely leave your website.


Use color combinations that are easy to read and view, such as black or blue text on a white background, as opposed to using bright or neon colors in your background or text.

, This will help keep your readers engaged in your content and will maintain browser compatibility, as some browsers may not support fonts that are less common.


Use common font types such as Arial, Courier New, Georgia, Times New Roman, and Verdana as opposed to fonts such as Comic Sans, Papyrus, and fonts displayed in cursive.

, Text that is separated into short paragraphs or made into bullets is more aesthetically pleasing to your visitors; as opposed to long paragraphs in a block-style format.


Publish text that makes up paragraphs that are comprised of no more than 3 or 4 sentences.

, Minimize the number of images you use, and use images that contain simple designs and minimal colors. If your web pages contain multiple animations or Adobe Flash effects, the pages will take a longer time to load.

, Don't use too much Flash or large images that take too long to load.

, Web servers can send the website files in a ‘compressed’ way that speeds up the page loading time, yet this doesn’t require any extra work from you besides turning it on. See the server’s (usually Apache’s) website documentation for more info.

, This will help you verify that your web pages load within 15 seconds. These tools usually also provide great advice on optimizing the website. You can find a variety of tools on the Internet by using keywords in the search engine such as ""web page loading tool"" or ""check load speed of website.""

, Make sure your titles are brief, relevant to page content, and include your keywords. Label your internal links and images with relevant titles and subtle keywords. Tag your headers appropriately and include keywords in your H1 tags.


Remember not to optimize your website in an unappealing manner. A clever webmaster can optimize without the reader recognizing the signs. This would mean using keywords sparingly and in the most effective areas.

, Since incoming links are the most important factor in SEO performance, it’s really important that other websites want to link to your website. To make this appealing for them, you should consistently publish new, valuable information for other websites to link to.

, Display the tagline for your business or website at the top of the web page, as well as prominent links for purchasing products or services.


As a 'bonus', if your visitors are engaged or interested in the information they see when they first land on your web page, they will most likely scroll down to see additional content and continue to navigate through each web page.

, An accurate headline that describes the topic or content of the web page will help intrigue and interest your visitors. For example, if your website contains a page with sale or clearance items, use a bold headline such as ""Clearance Items.""

, Include interesting images that break up the content, but don't inundate the visitor with them either. Web pages should be limited because you don't want to overwhelm your visitors. Avoid using too many frames, colors, font, and font sizes.

, The content should increase traffic while meeting the needs of your visitors. Content needs to be brief, but rich in information. Web pages are harder to read than paper pages, so don't overwhelm your readers with excessive content on one page. If you do have a lot to say about a subject, spread it out onto more than 1 page and break the sections up into 2 - 3 line paragraphs. Keep your pages clean and crisp.

, Examples of typical actions include allowing the visitors to:


Request another source of information
Sign up for a newsletter
Check out a related product - then to buy it, or place an order
Contact you

, Sometimes the visitor should simply do something after visiting the website, such as going into one of the stores, or filling in a form. Make sure to provide information to make this easy to do.

, If the website is for a business, wherever you’ve provided information to the visitor and you’re not sure what action they’ll want to take after reading it, you should simply provide a link to your contact page.

, This will help you verify that they display correctly; use browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, and more. Most browsers will recognize web pages that contain standard HTML and CSS code, however some (modern) code may not be recognizable by some browsers, which may cause your content to display inaccurately or appear unattractive. Explore the topics of ""graceful degradation"" and ""progressive enhancement"" for these situations.

, CSS media queries help you provide different styles for different devices or situations; make sure your website layout shows all the website content effectively for all 'media'.

, These web tools can be found be entering keywords into a search engine such as ""browser compatibility test.""

Brainstorm.,
Capture the analytics data for these keywords.,
Select the Keywords.,
Sort the keywords.,
Distribute the keywords across the web page.",How to Find Potential Keywords for Your Website," Firstly Brainstorm with industry experts and come up with a list of keywords for which you wish to provide content. Let say you have come up with 10 such keywords. Use these as your primary research keywords.;
, There are various keyword suggestion tools like Google adwords keyword tool, word tracker, and more paid and free tools. Most of these tools provide list of related keywords with their global and local search volume and the competition for the keywords.

, Pick the keywords from this suggestion list with higher search volume and low competition. Also you may need to eliminate unwanted or irrelevant keywords. Once you are fine with the keyword list try to sort them.

, After selecting the potential keywords with relevance, sort them or categorize them. For every page you may use a primary keyword and few secondary keywords. It is ideal to create information pertinent to these keywords. Keeping the keyword density factor in mind, prepare simple and user friendly content for your website.

, Use the keywords in the following areas to get more visibility. Use keywords in URL, Meta data, Headings, and content. Do this in an intelligent way so that you use these keywords only in relevant manner and with optimal density.

Consider what kind of site you're looking to have hosted.,
Register an account with a server.,
Choose a domain name.,
Test run your domain name.,
Fill your site with content.",How to Get a Free Domain2," A sub-domain type arrangement is available on a lot of sites, most notably Blogspot, Blogger and Wordpress. With these sites, you'll be able to choose a URL address free of charge, but have the host site's name included. Deciding what type of server you'll use depends on the content of the site itself. If you're a writing publication, for instance, Wordpress might be best. If it's a hobby site, Blogger may be best.If you were using Wordpress, for example, your URL might look like: www.testsite.wordpress.com.
These sites come with fairly intuitive interfaces, so they're great to use if you're not particularly tech-savvy.

, To get your sub-domain up and running, you'll need to access one of these sites and write up account info once you're sure what your site's going to be about. As with most sites, the process of registration is often quite simple.Some may distinguish between making an account and making the domain/site itself, allowing you to host multiple domains with one account.


The specifics of the registration information you'll need will vary from server to server, but you'll need an email, password and domain name for a free account, and a valid credit card if you decide to upgrade to paid account.

, Choosing a perfect domain name can make or break a website. Although the server name will be part of your overall URL, you'll have to choose your specific site name. Pick something that accurately defines what your site is about.For example, if your site is about books, you should include the word 'books' or something related, like 'literature', in the domain name. The domain should also be relatively easy to remember.


Don't be discouraged if your first choices are already taken. These server sites see a lot of traffic, and you can't be too picky with a free domain. If you get frustrated, try to find new permutations of your site's name. Try to avoid intentionally misspelling it purely for the sake of finding an available domain name.

, Once the registration has finally gone through, it's always good form to give your domain a test to see if it's active. Input the full URL (including the server heading following your site name) into your web browser's address box and press Enter. If it comes up to your (currently blank) webpage, you'll know the registration worked. With some servers, it may take up to 48 hours for the site to go live.Be patient; sometimes, an in-queue page will be interpreted as a failure because someone underestimates the harrowing level of traffic these servers have to sift through.

, Once your basic free domain has been created, it's up to you to fill it with content that your readers will find interesting. The possibilities are endless, and as a free domain, you can experiment to your heart's content without feeling the need to see real returns. While you're definitely recommended to upgrade to a paid domain if your web activity gets any bit serious, the free domain will give you lots of opportunity to brush up on your developing skills before you take the big plunge. Have fun!


With servers like Wordpress and Blogspot, you can purchase a domain name directly through them fairly inexpensively. This will remove their domain name from your address, thus allowing you to use their developer interface without having the unprofessional mark of a server name attached to your URL.

, Ask your fellow evaluators to rate the website on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 to 10 or simply by checking a box if the website has that feature.

, Navigate the website for 5 to 10 minutes before completing the evaluation.

, Answer whether the website provides the following content:


Decide whether the website provides all the relevant information for each product on the website, including prices. This should include technical specifications that are easy to understand. Review whether the website clarifies and explains technical aspects of the products themselves.
Decide whether the website offers anything that other websites don't offer. This can include exclusive products, free shipping, bundle offers, specials or anything else that is unique to this site.
Decide whether the website adequately explains its payment and shipping options.
Decide if the website posts reviews or gives adequate feedback from users about its products.

, This is the ease of navigating and purchasing from the website, as well as finding help, if it is needed. The following are good criteria for judging website functionality:


Review or rate the ease of navigating the website. Any e-commerce website should allow you to move from homepage to product pages to shopping carts.
Review whether the e-commerce site encourages customers and users to get involved. This is the ease of reviewing purchases, posting comments on articles or asking questions to support staff.
See whether the customer can perform 1-click shopping. This means the customer can click on an ""add to shopping cart"" button and be able to check out immediately. This is an important feature of any website.
Decide whether the website provides relevant links to other products, reviews or websites. The site should encourage interaction with its customers.
Evaluate the customer service provided by the website. Are there easy ways to access staff by phone, email, and even instant messaging? The more options and hours per day they provide customer service, the better the experience will be if there is a problem.

, E-commerce sites are sometimes built to scam customers, so it is important the website feels safe and authentic. The following are ways to judge whether the website is authentic:


Find whether the website offers a secure checkout and options to PayPal or Google Checkout, so the consumer can decide how to pay and what details to give to the site. Look for a written assurance the personal information of all consumers is kept private.
Review whether the site answers Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) which explain the company and its authenticity. They may also explain this in an ""About us"" section. Look for ways the company is involved in the community or news links to services it provides.
Decide whether the site has several interactions and ratings between its customers. This can help to show how long the site has been in business. Although it is not essential, it is a preference over newer sites that have not yet proved their authenticity.

, Although this is a subjective portion of the evaluation, it may gauge the willingness of a customer to come back in the future or visit the site often to check for specials. The following are good ways to rate the attractiveness of the site:


Decide whether the site has an attractive brand or image that is consistent through each page and checkout. This may also include emails or newsletters that a customer receives after making a purchase.
Review whether the website is ""fun."" An enjoyable site often features videos, music, entertaining articles or links to social media sites.
Rate the experience of using the site as either positive or negative. If the experience was positive, it is likely to be an attractive, user-friendly site.

, Encourage people to write down their impressions at the bottom.

, Many e-commerce websites have this problem, which can result in a Google penalty.

, Evaluate whether the site provides all the necessary details on shipping details and additional taxes if applicable

, Remember that when your business grows and starts to make a profit, you can always have the website updated by a more creative web design company and for more money.


Another thing worth remembering is that the web is an eminently international arena, so why not shop around internationally.

, For instance, if your site is only going to contain information but not accept online sales, it will be much easier to create. If, on the other hand you are going to be making frequent updates to your site, you may want to consider having a content management system.

, This is one of the most important steps of all, since there is no better way of deciding how good they are than viewing their work firsthand.


See what you think of the sites they have built for other people and keep in mind that, if you are trying to find the cheapest web design company around, their work may not be as high in quality as other more expensive companies. This is commonsense and there is no way round it.

, Even if your first website is not a show-stopper, the important thing is that you have a platform for marketing your business on the Internet. This in itself is one of the quickest and best ways to ensure your business quickly becomes profitable and successful.

Any vector based graphics editor will should allow you to save your graphic as an SVG.
In illustrator, select ""Save As"" from the file tab. In the dialog box, select SVG from the dropdown list, then click save.
You may encounter an ""SVG Options"" dialog box. There are several versions of the SVG file format, generally, version 1.1 is fine. Select OK and continue.

,


In the file explorer, right click your new SVG file and select ""Open with"" from the list.
From the available programs, select any text editor. You may need to select ""More Apps"" or ""Choose another app"" if your desired text editor is not in the list.
Notepad is fine, however, you may choose to open your SVG in an IDE such as Visual Studio.

,


Once opened, use your cursor to select only the contents of the <svg> tag.
There will be a line at the top of the file that begins with ""<?xml ..."" Ignore this line and any additional comment lines at the top of the document.
Everything within the <svg> tags is valid HTML markup and may be placed in an HTML page.

,


Open your HTML page in a text editor and paste the block of code you copied from the last step into your web page.
The SVG tag may be place anywhere in the body of your HTML markup.

,
If your graphic is already sized properly and appears as you desire it, you may stop after this step.

, If this is the case, simply add classes to the existing attribute.
e.g <svg class=""SVGclass"" ...

,
One of the benifits of the SVG format is that it may be scaled to any size without quality loss.
Within the angle brackets of the SVG, you may create two new atributes for width and height if they do not already exist. e.g width=""150"" height=""200"". The value within the quotation marks indicates the pixel dimensions of the graphic
Alternativley, you may set the dimensions using CSS by targeting the class that you assigned to your SVG. e.g .SVGclass{ width: 200px }

, This step will make any further styling using CSS much easier.


Each <g> tag within the markup of the SVG represents a group that you created in your graphics software.
Comment, or add custom classes to the tags withing your SVG so that they may be targeted with CSS

, They can be given style and class attributes for styling.
Paths and shapes within your svg can have their fill, stroke, stroke-width, and many other styles edited with CSS.
For example: .IceCream{ fill: blue; }

,


All of your new styling should be visible within a web browser.
Repeat steps 10 and 11 until you graphic has all of the desired styling.

Become more shareable by providing your visitors a couple of easy ways to share your content would be a good start.",How to Improve Your Page Rank," The most important factor for your page rank is the content on your site. If your content is original and useful, it will draw more visitors than a page with poor content. Creating good content is not a simple task, and involves a lot of different factors.;
, Websites that stagnate and do not stay current will drop in the ranks. If you’re writing a blog, try to update at least once a week at the minimum.

, If readers click away from your site after discovering that the content does not match their search, you will get penalized when they leave quickly., Your content should be optimized for both keywords and conversational searches. The best way to do this is to make your article titles as close to the popular search query for that topic as possible. Make sure that your content answers the questions of the readers, or provides unique insight.

, Google will recognize this and ding your ranking because of it.Make sure that your site’s meta description is accurate. This is displayed to users when your site shows up on searches. An accurate description will lead to more clicks top your site, and less bounces upon landing on your site.






Google’s Hummingbird update for their search engine algorithms has made keywords much less important than conversational searches. This reflects changes in the way that people search for things. For example, instead of looking for the keyword “iPhone”, Google will look for pages that answer questions such as “Which is the best iPhone for me?”, When search engines see that visitors are coming to your site from other sites, your page rank will increase. The more reputable the site the viewer originated from, the more impact this will have on your rank. You can add backlinks by commenting on other blogs and adding a link to your site when you sign off, or you can provide content for other websites and then link back to your site via your credit.

, A sitemap is a text file that lays out the pages of your site. It makes it easier for the Google bots to find all of the links and content on your website, as well as determine their importance. There are a variety of websites that will generate a sitemap for you, or you can create one yourself. See this guide for more details.

, If you can afford to hire translators or have a community willing to do the translation work, you can significantly increase your audience by making your pages available in other languages. This increase in traffic will help to increase your page rank., An RSS feed will help bring in new readers to your site, as well as retain existing ones. This will show consistent traffic, which will in turn positively affect your rank. You can use automated programs or create your own. This guide explains the process in detail.

, Social networks are a great way to spread backlinks among a large number of viewers. Viewers will link your site for you if your content proves valuable. This will in turn increase your traffic, which will lead to an increase in your rank.


Creating a compelling link to your site is incredibly important for social networks. The reader needs to be intrigued enough to follow the link, and it needs to stand out from the deluge of news on their feed.







, For this, your set tweets should be below 120 characters so that it is easy for others to re-tweet. Also, try writing a great hook over the Facebook link, share along with adding up your own commentary. The content in which you share over your different social media platforms should be of good quality and worth reading."

Set some settings for optimum performance:
shared_buffers: Sets the shared memory buffers per PG Cluster.",How to Improve Your Online Database Performance in PostgreSQL," Adjust it large enough to hold most commonly accessed tables/indexes AND small enough to avoid swap page-in activity.
work_mem: Controls the amount of memory used for sorting and hash operations. If not big enough, sorting spills over to disk. To help adjust properly, watch Postgres temp location on disk: $PGDATA/base/DBOID/pgsql_tmp. Memory allocated per session. Adjusted per session.
work_maintenance_mem: Controls the amount of memory used for DB maintenance operations such as “vacuum” and “create index”. Can dramatically reduce time to complete such DB maintenance operations.
effective_cache_size: Sets the optimizer assumption on how effective the O/S disk cache. It doesn’t physically allocate memory. Adjust it to at least 2/3 of available RAM to influence the optimizer to perform index scans over table scans(seqscan).
random_page_cost: Sets estimated cost of non-sequentially fetching. Lower it to influence the optimizer to perform index scans over table scans.
enable_indexscan: When set to true, query optimizer favors index scan over table scans
enable_seqscan: When set to true, optimizer favors table (sequential) scans over index scans.
enable_hashjoin: When set to true, optimizer favors use of hash joins.
enable_nestloop: When set to true, optimizer favors use of nested loop joins.
enable_mergejoin: When set to true, optimizer favors use of merge joins. Used for tuning/testing queries. Note: Before deciding on using the Postgres optimizer hints (step 6-10) in production, you should re-visit the other query tuning parameters (step 1 to 5) and fine-tune
max_fsm_pages: Sets the maximum number of disk pages for which free space will be tracked in the shared free-space map. Properly adjust upward to make vacuum runs faster and eliminate/reduce the need to “vacuum full” or “reindex”. Should be slightly more than the total number of data pages which will be touched by updates and deletes between vacuums. Requires little memory (6 bytes per slot), so be generous adjusting its size. When running vacuum with “verbose” option, DB engine advises you about the proper size.;

Give your readers options to share.",How to Improve Your Alexa Ranking," Alexa generates statistics based on the browsing habits of users who have the Alexa toolbar installed on their browser. This means that the sample set that Alexa uses is very small, and also skewed towards people who tend to have lots of toolbars installed in their browser (most scanners classify the Alexa toolbar as ""adware"" or ""trackware""). Alexa is only one small measurement for the effectiveness of your site, and has no bearing on your search engine ranking.Generally, you will see increases in your Alexa ranking if you are bringing in more traffic through quality content and effective search engine optimization (SEO).;
, The number one way to improve traffic to your site is to create quality, unique content. There are a lot of ways to do this, depending on what your site is for. If you're trying to increase traffic to a blog, ensure that all of your posts are well-written and unique. If your site is photography-based, strive for the best pictures on the internet.Whatever your content is, ensure that it is error-free and presented well.

, A regular update schedule will keep readers coming back to your site again and again, and will show the search engines that your site is active. If you're writing a blog, try to update weekly at least.

, In the era of social networking, shareability is one of the most important aspects of increasing your traffic. This means having an attention-grabbing headline, a few captivating lead-in sentences, and a compelling image. This makes your content attractive to readers when your viewers share your content on their social network feeds.

, The preferred style for websites is constantly changing and evolving, and if you're still using the same design your site had in 2009, you are significantly behind the times. A clean, well-functioning site will do wonders for your traffic and will help you retain visitors.


Consider hiring a professional web developer to create a sleek, modern site for your content.

, If you still want to focus on increasing your Alexa rank , there are many programs you can join that promise to boost your rank. They do this by having many of their users with the Alexa toolbar installed visit your site, increasing your rankings. These programs cost money, and the benefits of an increased Alexa ranking via these means are questionable, because you are not actually improving your site's popularity.


Comment on blogging niche blogs. You can comment on those blog which are in “Blogging” niche. It will help your website to get referral traffic from blogging related sites. Most Visitors on these blogs have Alexa Toolbar installed. It will easily improve your site's Alexa ranking.

, Proper keyword use can help your content appear in major search engines. Overloading your content with keywords will work against you; they need to naturally flow with the content. Use the Google AdWords tool to find the keywords that are most important for your niche.


Articles - This is the primary place where you need to optimize your keywords. Make sure that the keywords appear in natural places in the body of your content. Use the most important keywords a couple of times each.
URLs - You can include keywords in your URL that may or may not appear in the article. This is a good place to include keywords that don't necessarily fit into the article.

, Images can generate a lot of traffic from image search engines such as Google Images. Image descriptions should have several important keywords included in the alt text. Also ensure that your images are the smallest they can be without sacrificing quality, as a long load time can negatively affect your page ranking.Your image's filename should describe what the image is. Avoid ""Image1"", ""Image2"", etc.

, Back links are one of the most effective ways to drive traffic back to your site.Guest posting is one way that people gain back links, but it has been criticized as a potential spam signal by Google.The trustworthiness of the site that contains a link to your site will affect how much weight is given to it in search rankings.
The anchor text, or text that is displayed in place of the link address, should be relevant to the content that is being linked to.

, Your sitemap will allow the bots to easily see how your site is laid out. A good site map will help your pages get indexed into the major search engines. You can create your sitemap yourself, or use a tool to generate one.



Place your sitemap in the root directory of your web server.

, You'll want to ensure that search engine bots can easily crawl your site. This means that all of your links should be working and the site should be easily navigable. There are several services online that allow you to run crawler simulations on your site.Some of the more popular crawling simulators include GSiteCrawler, Screaming Frog and Xenu. These bot simulators will help expose any problematic areas regarding the navigation and structure of your site.

, The three you'll want to focus on are Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Submitting your site to these search engines will help you get indexed quickly. See this guide for more details on submitting your website.

, Facebook and Google+ both allow you to create social media pages for your site, and are two of the most popular social networks online. Whenever you release a new piece of content on your site, link to it on both of these services.

, Either use your personal Twitter account or create an account for your site or business. Post links to all of your new content, and use the Twitter account to interact with readers and other content creators in the same niche as you.


Twitter is a very public forum, and care should be taken when saying things in the name of your website. If people take offense to your tweets, which happens more often than you might think, you can quickly create a public relations nightmare.

, An RSS feed will allow your visitors to subscribe and be instantly notified when new content is uploaded. You can create your RSS feed manually or use a variety of tools to create one.

, If you have a user registration system, consider having all users automatically opted in to a mailing list. This mailing list can highlight the new content you are most proud of, and can bring back viewers who haven't been to your site in a while., Give all of your articles buttons to allow readers to submit your articles to aggregate sites. Sites like Reddit, StumbleUpon, and Digg can generate a lot of traffic if the content is posted there correctly.

Use Keywords.,
Use Trends.,
Add yourself to Google.",How to Improve Search Engine Optimization1," Google Keywords, a tool within the Google AdSense website, allows you to track keywords and find keyword suggestions. Browse the site and get familiar with how it works and then use it to your advantage. Find keywords that will help you maximize your website's viewership.;
, Google Trends tells you how searches in a subject change over time. You can use it to predict spikes and slumps as well as to know when you should update and change pages for the season or switch to using different keywords. You can look at and compare several different terms at a time

, Google will reward Google Plus users and also businesses which are registered on Google Maps. Take advantage and join Google, as it is the most popular search engine by far.

Refresh the page, step back, and admire your web site's beautiful new icon.

",How to Create a Favicon.ico," It should be a simple image, so that it's instantly recognizable.;
, It must be called exactly this, or the browser won't recognize it. An easy way to do this is to use the Dynamic Drive FavIcon Generator. Another way is to use a free image editor GIMP and save the 16x16 image in ICO format.

,, You should put it in the <head> section of the code, and make sure the path to the icon is correct, relative to the web page. Code follows (assuming both .html and .ico are in the same top directory):


<link rel=""shortcut icon"" href=""favicon.ico"" />

Have quality content.,
Create original content.,
Incorporate appropriate images.,
Use keywords.,
Target niche keywords with low competition.,
Have a site map.",How to Improve Search Engine Optimization2," Quality content, in other words lots of original, error-free text organized well on a modern-looking website, is what matters most in terms of SEO that you can control. Hiring a professional website designer can help with the cosmetics and get you taken seriously by your visitors. You'll also want to be sure that you're not misleading visitors, they should be getting what was advertised when they looked at the site's description.

, You also create quality content by making sure that your content is original. This means that not only should each page of your site have different content than every other page of your site, but it also means that you'll be docked for stealing the content of others. Make your text original!

, Quality images, tagged with good keywords, can also help your rankings with search engines.

, Find the most relevant and search keywords that relate to the content you provide and then add those keywords to your site text. Use the word a few times within the page in a way that relates to the rest of the text and is natural. Going over the top with the word-drops or pairing them with content that is irrelevant will get you punished in the rankings, however.

, This involves at least a little bit of figuring out what makes your business unique. Maybe you're not just a clothing designer, but you're a geeky clothing designer. Maybe you're not just an auto shop but you're an auto shop in Seattle. Try to use Google Adwords to check how competitive your keywords are before deciding on them. Be sure that the keywords have at least some searches. You will want to try using broader key words too.

, Create a site map that tells people where everything is on your site. You will get about a 1% click through rate to your site map. However, it will do wonders for those who know what site maps do, and the Search Engines will like it as well.

"
Choose a good domain name.,
Use descriptions and Meta tags.,
Use headers.,
Keep it simple.",How to Improve Search Engine Optimization3," Keywords as the first word in a domain name will boost your traffic a little. Using a country TLD (top level domain) will boost your rankings locally but hurt you internationally so use that with caution. Avoid dated domain naming techniques like replacing words with numbers. Being a subdomain (like a something.tumblr.com) will also hurt you.


Keywords in your own subpages and subdomains also help. Your subpages especially should always have a descriptive title.

, Descriptions are a tagged part of your website code which describe the content on the page. Having one at all will help your rankings and having one which contains good keywords will help even more. If your site is using the same tags for all the pages, you are not helping search engines figure out the subject or relevance of your individual pages. Regarding Meta Tags, there are 2 very important fields:


Title Tag - arguably the most important SEO tag for any website. Google supports approx. 60 characters in the title, while Yahoo allows for up to 110 characters in the title. It is important to target the most critical keywords in the Title. Every page should have a unique Title.
META Description Tag - These were once important but are no longer. Some engines do display the description defined, while others do not. Some search engines do read the description tag, and do utilize the content found within in the ranking process. Google, MSN and Yahoo give very little weight to no weight for these.

, Headers are similar to descriptions and the same rules apply: having one at all helps and having one with keywords is even better. Use them!

, Keep the structure, navigation and URL structure of your site simple enough for search engines to follow. Remember that search engines cannot parse your navigation if it's using flash or javascript. So try to stay close to standard HTML when it comes to Navigation. URLs with dynamic parameters (?, &, SIDs) usually do not perform when it comes to search engine rankings.

Create quality backlinks.,
Do NOT spam.,
Do that social media thing.,
Update your site regularly.",How to Improve Search Engine Optimization4," Backlinks are when another website links to your page. It works in your favor if the website is one that gets more hits than yours does. The best types of ""link building"" are directory registration, text link advertising, and press release distribution, but you can also build links by doing a link exchange, cross promotion, or guest blogging for a relevant blog.


Try to offer valuable information or tools so that other people are motivated to link to your site. This will increase the chances of natural backlinks.

, Spamming comment sections and other website areas (read: anywhere on wikiHow!) will actually make Google and other search engines dock you severely or remove you entirely. Do not spam people to build backlinks for yourself. Search engines will also punish you if your name is attached to spamming complaints or if you operate your website anonymously.

, Right now, social media share and likes are the activity which is most rewarded by Google and other search engines. especially for subjects that are currently relevant. Create social media accounts with the major sites and update them regularly. Avoid being spammy by not just posting ads: post pictures of customers, events that you attend relating to your business, and other content that your fans might enjoy., Most search engines reward websites which see regular or at least recent updates.

Decide if you are happy with your current Quality Scores.,
Spot check a couple of your very top keywords to see if there are any problems.,
The easiest way to improve your QS is to boost your click through rate (CTR).,
Set up Ad copy experiments to boost your CTR on your top keywords.",How to Improve Adwords Quality Score," Download your top keywords by sales into Adwords Editor, and see what Google thinks about them. (If you don't see the Quality Score, simply select 'show quality score' on the columns menu on top left.);
, From the campaigns tab, select the Keywords tab and click the white speech bubble, which will tell you not only the QS of that keywords, but click-through rate, ad relevance, and landing page experience. Note if there are any problems.


If you have 'below average' for landing page experience, then you have a problem to fix. If landing page experience is the issue, first confirm you are not a fraudster, selling weight loss, payday loans or similar. If you are, it is unlikely you will get out of this penalty box, so you should try buying ads on Facebook instead! If you are not, and Google simply thinks you are not relevant, then you should speak to your web designers about getting more relevant content onto the landing page.
If you are below average for Ad Relevance, that means Google thinks your Keywords, Ads and Landing Pages are not related. Try putting keywords into all three as a theme. For example, if you are selling personal robots, make sure that the landing page says personal robot, and it says personal robot somewhere in your Ad copy.

, There is no way to know everything about the 100+ separate elements that Google has stated are part of your Quality Scores, but they do tell us the number one element is your Click Through Rate (CTR) on Google Search. That's right, Google shows your ads on tens of thousands of different websites including Ask.com and AOL.com, but they only care about how you are doing on Google!


To see your CTR on Google, go to the Ads menu, click on the ""Segment"" button and select Network (With Search Partners).

, You do this by adding a new Ad to run at the same time as your existing one. This is called A/B testing. For example, one time tested way of increasing your CTR on a keyword is to put that keyword into your ad copy.


After you put a new Ad live and confirm it is showing, come back and see if it is doing better than the old ad at a later time, waiting at least a few days.
If you find your new ad has a better CTR, turn off the old one. Then wait a few days and check again, and you may be rewarded with a better QS.

Check your index status.,
Go to Google.com and search for your URL.,
Repeat with Bing.",How to Get Your Website to Show up on the Search Engines1," You can find out if your site's been indexed pretty quickly by doing a couple of simple searches.


While your first thought may be ""Google it,"" there are actually 2 primary search engines: Google and Bing. Note that Bing actually comprises Bing, MSN, and Yahoo.;
, If it does not appear, it has not been indexed yet.

, It's possible one will show as indexed, and the other not.


Searching for your site's content as opposed to its URL could give you misleading results. For example, if you have a site about juggling, you do a search for ""juggling"" and don't find your site on the first few pages, you might assume it hasn't been indexed. But consider that ""juggling"" returns nearly 7 million results, and you will see that it's possible you are indexed, just not in the top 50 results. Or even top 5,000!

Get linked.",How to Get Your Website to Show up on the Search Engines2," Search engines use ""spiders"" to crawl around the web on existing links, looking for new ones. There are several ways to get a spider to weave a web to your site.


If you already have a blog or another website that is indexed, put a link to your new website, and don't bury it. Make it big and bold. You want people to see it, to click it, and to visit your site!
Ask somebody with an indexed website to link to your website. It could be as simple as an embedded reference, or an ad for your product. The more people linked to your website, the better, so don't be shy if you want to self-promote.
Submit your website to popular social bookmarking sites like Digg and Stumbleupon.
Submit your website to the Open Directory Project (ODP). (See how Open Directory Project shows in blue? That's the link back to dmoz.org, the ODP site). ODP is a multilingual open content directory of links that is reviewed and maintained by volunteer editors.
Include a link to your new site on your Facebook page and Twitter profile. In fact, put a link on every website you can. This will not only ensure you get indexed quickly, it will help you raise your search rank as well, through what's called Search Engine Optimization.

Submit your XML Sitemap.",How to Get Your Website Indexed by Google," When you create a new website or add a new page to your site, visit Google's Submit URL page. It's as simple as typing in the URL, checking the captcha box, and hitting Submit Request.


Easy though this is, we recommend also using both the HTML site map and the XML Sitemap methods below. These are a little more advanced to dig into for a new webmaster, but well worth the effort.;
, The sooner you can get links to new content, the sooner Google will index it. Google's search bots tend to crawl blog content more often than regular websites. Use this to your advantage by creating a simple blog to announce new content on the site., Social networking icons encourage your users to link back to your site. This is an easy way to create backlinks and engage visitors, a win-win situation.

, Log in to Google Search Console (formerly called Webmaster Tools) with your Google account. (Or sign up for one if you don't have one.) Verify your site here to prove that you are its owner:


Click Add a Property and type in the domain name of your site.
Follow the onscreen instructions to verify your site. (Download the HTML file, upload it to your website, then follow the link to confirm the upload.)
Click Verify.

, Google treats http://www.(yoursite) and http://(yoursite) as separate pages. Merge this into single results as follows:Repeat the verification process with the other version of your URL (with or without the ""www."")
Click the gear icon, then ""Site Settings.""
Under ""Preferred Domain,"" select the option you prefer.
Optionally, redirect the non-preferred URL to your preferred version. This is not necessary for Google, but will help other search engines.

, Google recommends logging in about once a month to see if there are any surprising errors or dips in traffic.This site also provides a variety of indexing-related tools. For example, you can confirm that Google can access your pages (""Fetch as Google""), notify Google of a domain change (""Change of Address""), and issue urgent blocks on content you need to take off your site (""Remove URLs"").


Right now, creating a site map is more important than playing with these tools. You will be using Search Console later in this guide, however, so stay logged in.

, This is simply a list of links to every page you'd like indexed. Since search bots usually index by following links, this allows them to index your entire site at once.Create this list just as you would any page on your website, using HTML or blog tools.


Some blog software already lists all your blog posts in a column visible on every page. This is an automatic site map. You can skip down to the XML sitemap instructions later in this section.

, If your site map lists more than 100 links, Google may mistake it for spam. It's best to list just the main categories instead, divided by topic, chronology, or some other method that helps your users.For example, wikiHow's site map only lists general categories. Clicking ""Aviation"" takes you to a smaller ""map"" of Aviation-related pages.


For very large websites, use an automatic HTML site map generator, available online or through web developer tool extensions. Make sure not to confuse this with a tool that creates XML sitemaps, described later in this section.

, Upload the HTML site map to your website. Insert a link to the site map on your website footer, or somewhere else where it will appear on every page. Now a search bot can index your entire site even if it starts out on an obscure corner of your site.


Site maps are useful for visitors as well as search bots. There's no need to hide this link.

, This is another form of site map that is only visible to search bots, not to users. This is not a replacement for an HTML site map; it's generally a good idea to have both.The XML Sitemap provides meta information to search engines, notably how often pages are updated. This can increase the speed that Google indexes new or updated content on your site.This format also allows you to submit extra information about video and other files that search bots can't read. For example, this may allow Google to present a thumbnail image of the video on the search results, along with the title and duration.

, Most webmasters choose to use an automatic Sitemap tool, such as the Google XML Sitemaps Wordpress plugin, the general-purpose XML-Sitemaps.com, or a variety of other free options you can find online.Typically, all you need to do is enter your site's domain name and download the completed Sitemap file. You could also try these alternatives:Some website hosts, including Google Sites, create the sitemap for you and do not allow you to alter it. Refer to the host's help center if you have trouble locating your sitemap file.
If your blog has an RSS 2.0 or Atom 1.0 feed, you can submit that in place of an XML Sitemap. All you need is the URL of the feed.
If nothing else works, make your own bare-bones Sitemap by creating a .txt document that lists all your site's page URLS on a separate line. The URLs must be UTF-8 encoded to handle special characters, but many text programs will do this for you if you check a box on the Save screen.
If you are interested in customizing your Sitemap's metadata, you can find more information on writing Sitemaps from Google Search Console API and other online resources.

, Upload it to the root directory, as the site map cannot list higher-level pages.Unlike the HTML site map, this one should not be accessible by users.

, Log on to https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/ Google Search Console]. Visit your Sitemap list by clicking ""Sitemaps"" on the right hand side. Click Add/Test Sitemap on the top right corner.Enter the URL of the Sitemap file you uploaded (or your blog's RSS feed), then click Test. Click Open Test Results and correct all listed errors.Check the list at the bottom of this page for more explanations on error messages.

, Click the same Add/Test Sitemap button. This time, hit Submit Sitemap. Google's search bots now officially have access to all the juicy metadata that puts your content in the search results.

This service is free and provides direct measurement, but it's available for some websites only.
For instance, for the website Trello, with domain name trello.com, you can get data at https://www.quantcast.com/trello.com.Similarly, for the website Glassdoor, with domain name glassdoor.com, you can get data at https://www.quantcast.com/glassdoor.com.In case of subdomains, you should enter the subdomain name instead of the domain. For instance, for the Math Stack Exchange (math.stackexchange.com), you would look for data at https://www.quantcast.com/math.stackexchange.com.There are two kinds of websites: those that use Quantcast Measure (that Quantcast calls ""quantified""), and those that do not. For websites that use Quantcast Measure, you will see the website name and a check mark in front of the name on top, and website traffic data below. For websites that do not use Quantcast Measure you will see a message on top of the form: ""<website> is not currently using Quantcast Measure. As a result, we're unable to show you a full breakout of their audience data. If you own or work at <website> sign up for Quantcast Measure and place the measurement tag on your site to get all the audience insights detailed below."" Previously, Quantcast used to show indirectly estimated data for sufficiently high-traffic websites not using Quantcast Measure, but now it does not show this data.






For websites that do use Quantcast Measure, some sections of the traffic report may not be visible. There are two typical reasons for this: (a) the website owner has opted out of making that section of the traffic report visible, and (b) there is too little data to populate that section of the report (for websites with reasonable traffic, this generally happens only if the website turned on Quantcast Measure less than 30 days ago). For each hidden part of the traffic report, a message explaining that the section is hidden, along with the reason, is displayed at the part of the page where the section would have shown up. The message shown for (a) is ""This publisher has not made the data in this report publicly available. If this is your profile, make sure you are logged in to view this report."" The message shown for (b) is ""Not enough data has been collected to populate this report. If you're the admin of this profile and believe this is an error, see our implementation guide for troubleshooting tips.""






In case you get the error message (a), check archive.is for older versions of the page. You might be able to locate an older version when the publisher had not restricted access to the data. However, versions stored in archive.is will not have full functionality. Examples of websites that used to show public data but do not now are: Twitch.tv,and CNN.Note that you cannot use the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) because this does not archive Quantcast reports. So you must use archive.is for looking up data.;
,

Most of the websites that share data with Quantcast and allow Quantcast to show the data publicly tend to be media websites whose business model is advertising-based. Moreover, most of them are either based in on have a significant presence in the United States, since Quantcast data is most reliable and most useful to show to advertisers for United States audiences. In particular, if the topic of your website is not one that media companies and publishing groups have interest in, it can be hard to find examples to benchmark against.
Another thing to keep in mind regarding the availability of Quantcast data is that the decision to share data with Quantcast is made at the level of the media company or publishing group, rather than the individual website. Therefore, either all (or most) of the websites under a given publishing group would have QM data publicly visible, or none would. Some publishing groups and companies that have publicly available QM data for most of their sites include: the Stack Exchange Network (Stack Overflow and all Stack Exchange sites), Tegna, Woven Digital (Uproxx, Brobible, and some other male-focused humor and celebrity news sites), Vox Media Network (Vox, Eater, Racked, and a few other sites), Onion Media Network (The Onion and sister sites), COED Media Group Network (COED, College Candy, and Busted Coverage), Bonnier Corporation Network (many outdoors sporting sites as well as popsci.com), and Idle Media (HipHopEarly and sister sites). Some publishers that do not use Quantcast Measure or do not share the data publicly include Hearst, Conde Nast, and Time Inc.
Image-sharing sites (such as Imgur, Giphy, Gfycat) all have publicly available Quantcast Measure data.
However, it doesn't hurt to check even if you don't expect the website to share data using Quantcast Measure. For instance, Trelloand Glassdoorboth use Quantcast Measure though they don't fit the ""publisher"" stereotype perfectly.

,

The first section of the traffic report is the Traffic Card, showing total uniques, views, and visits over a time range of your choosing, and at a granularity of day, week, or 30 day. Uniques are available only over time periods of a day, week, or 30 days. Data is available only from the point in time the website started using Quantcast Measure. Data is broken down as United States and non-United States. The timezone is chosen based on the place where the majority of traffic to the website comes from; for most websites that use Quantcast Measure, this is the United States, and the timezone is Mexico City's timezone (as that it close to the average of the various US timezones). The traffic numbers are based on direct, first-party measurement (using Quantcast's JavaScript installed on the website, that works in a similar way as Google Analytics). It therefore measures all traffic by users on browsers that can run JavaScript and are not using an ad blocker setting that blocks analytics tools. The numbers shown here can be compared with the numbers shown in Google Analytics, though they may not exactly match.
The second section of the traffic report is the Demographics Card. This includes gender, age buckets, education level, and race. Unlike the traffic card, the demographics card is not based purely on direct measurement: it is based on a mix of measurement and extrapolation, where the demographic characteristics of each visitor are estimated based on a variety of visitor-specific signals. Quantcast uses seed data from a panel of users who have disclosed all the relevant demographic data about themselves. Some of the data is only available for the United States subset of the audience. You can click on ""View Details"" at the bottom left for more information. The gender and age data here can be compared with the gender and age data shown in Google Analytics, at Audience > Demographics > Gender and Audience > Demographics > Age respectively. The other characteristics are not reported in Google Analytics.






Also of interest is the Geographic Card (reports top countries and cities sending traffic). This can be expanded to show more information using the ""View Details"" at the bottom left. Of these, the Geographic Card can be compared against corresponding data in Google Analytics under Audience > Geo > Location. The Engagement Card can be compared against the data in Google Analytics under Audience > Cohort Analysis. However, the displays do not precisely match.






Other relevant sections include: Cross-Platform Card (compares user behavior across platforms) and Engagement Card (segments users based on number of visits and reports counts in each segment; note that this is visible only to logged in users but does not require payment).






The General Interests Card near the bottom contains a list of similar websites visited by users who visit the website. These can be useful to obtain benchmarks to compare site traffic against. The links point to the Quantcast pages for the websites; however, not every website listed uses Quantcast Measure.







,

Websites may take themselves off of Quantcast Measure, or may stop making their data publicly visible. So you should save or screenshot the page, or record any data you need to, while you can access the data.
You can request archival of the existing report using archive.is. Note that the archived page will not have the full functionality of the original page because of limitations in the way archival interacts with JavaScript.

,

If the website owner is not using Quantcast Measure, consider contacting the website owner proposing it.
If the website owner is using Quantcast Measure, and has not made the data available, consider contacting the website owner regarding making the data publicly available. However, since Quantcast Measure makes data publicly visible by default, website owners who choose to hide the data are usually convinced of the superiority of doing so, and you may not be persuasive.

Keep in mind the following regarding error ranges, in cases where the data is estimated and not measured with Google Analytics.,
Consider contacting the website owner to connect the SimilarWeb data with Google Analytics.,
If you use SimilarWeb frequently, consider installing the SimilarWeb browser extension (or add-on).The browser extension is available for Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox (where it's called an ""add-on""),and Safari.With this extension, you will be able to, whenever you visit a website, view the SimilarWeb metrics from within your browser itself, without having to separately visit the SimilarWeb profile of the website.",How to Get Traffic Analytics for a Website You Don't Own2,"
For instance, for the domain zillow.com, you can get data at https://www.similarweb.com/website/zillow.com.In case of subdomains, enter the subdomain name instead of the domain name. For instance, to get data on ocw.mit.edu, you would go to https://www.similarweb.com/website/ocw.mit.edu.Data shown for a domain name aggregates data over all subdomains. Profiles for subdomains are fairly similar to profiles for domains, with a few differences: ranks and subdomain breakdowns are available only on domain profiles.
For some websites, SimilarWeb may redirect to the error page https://www.similarweb.com/error/notfound. This means that SimilarWeb saw no traffic, or too little traffic, to the website and has not built a profile for it.
For most websites, SimilarWeb uses ""estimated data"", measured by extrapolation from a small panel of users it tracks (and therefore not necessarily accurate). You will see the text ""Estimated Data Claim Your Website"" on the page in such cases, at the top right of the ""Traffic Overview"" chart. For a few websites, you will see ""Measured by Google Analytics"" on the right, indicating that the data is taken from Google Analytics because the website owner connected SimilarWeb with Google Analytics. The feature to connect with Google Analytics is in beta so it may not work properly at any given time.






If you have SimilarWeb PRO, you will be able to see more data than the default level of data visible on SimilarWeb.If you want to access historical data, check for archives of the SimilarWeb profile using archive.is.

,

At the top you can see the rank of the website globally, in its country, and in its category. You can click through to get the list of top websites globally, by country, or by category. The basic SimilarWeb only gives a list of the top 50 websites; with SimilarWeb PRO you can get a longer list. Note that these ranks depend on estimated traffic computation for all websites in the category; since each of the traffic estimates could be inaccurate, the rank could also be inaccurate.
The next section, Traffic Overview, includes a plot of total visits over the last six months, by month. To the right of the plot is information on total visits, average visit duration, pages per visit, and bounce rate over the last month. With SimilarWeb PRO, you will be able to get data over the last three years rather than the last six months. For most websites, the data is estimated rather than directly measured; for websites that have connected Google Analytics, the data is measured and says ""Measured with Google Analytics"" on the top right of the Traffic Overview section.
Additional subsections under Traffic Overview include Traffic by countries and Traffic sources. Later sections are Referral, Search, Social, and Display Advertising.
The Website Content section provides information on Subdomains, Folders, and Popular Pages. The basic SimilarWeb only shows the top five subdomains. With SimilarWeb PRO, you can see more subdomains, as well as get access to Folders and Popular Pages.






The Audience Interests and Similar Sites sections provide more information on related topics and websites.

,

SimilarWeb only shows a six-month history for visits and one month of estimated data for other metrics. Therefore, you should record, by saving or screenshotting, any data you want to reference in the future.
You can request archival of the existing profile using archive.is. Note that the archived page will not have the full functionality of the original page because of limitations in the way archival interacts with JavaScript.

,

The estimated values (for visits and pageviews) reported by SimilarWeb vary between half of and three times the values directly measured by sources such as Quantcast Measure.

Glassdoor reported about 40 million visits and 140 million pageviews on Quantcast Measure in March 2017,compared with 54.5 million visits and about 200 million pageviews on SimilarWeb in the same time period.Trello reported about 46 million visits and 75 million pageviews on Quantcast Measure in March 2017,compared with about 85 million visits and 600 million pageviews on SimilarWeb.Stack Overflow reported about 265 million visits and 660 million pageviews on Quantcast Measure in March 2017,compared with 337 million visits and 1 billion pageviews on SimilarWeb.Upworthy reported 9.6 million visits and 11.3 million pageviews on Quantcast Measure in March 2017,compared with 7.5 million visits and 9.5 million pageviews on SimilarWeb.Accuracy in estimation of visits and pageviews is higher for websites with more traffic, and more unique visitors.
Ranks and category ranks should be treated as loose estimates.
Although the monthly traffic levels are not very accurate, the trends between months are somewhat more accurate. In other words, you can use the six-month graph of visits to get some sense of how traffic is varying with time. However, before drawing any conclusions, see if the trend is consistent with what you would expect given the annual traffic cycle for that type of website. Unfortunately, a six-month history does not provide a clear view into the full annual cycle. If you have SimilarWeb PRO, you will be able to get a better sense of whether an annual cycle is being captured and how that compares with expectations.

, This will help the website owner be able to share up-to-date traffic data at any time, without having to manually export data from Google Analytics., The extension does not give you access to any other information beyond what you can get from the profile -- it just makes the lookup process quicker.
In return, installing the extension means that you get included in the panel of users whose behavior is collected by SimilarWeb to estimate website traffic.

If you use Alexa frequently, consider installing the Alexa browser extension (or add-on).",How to Get Traffic Analytics for a Website You Don't Own3,"



This service is a freemium one, and offers mostly estimated results, but for almost all websites.
For instance, for the website zillow.com of Zillow, you can get data at http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/zillow.com.Similarly, for the website trello.com of Trello, you can get data at http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/trello.com.Traffic for subdomains is included in traffic for the main domain, and if you enter a subdomain in the URL structure above, it redirects to the page for the main domain. For instance, http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ocw.mit.edu redirects to http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/mit.edu.
For most websites, Alexa uses estimated data, rather than direct first-party measured data. You will see a box on the top right saying ""This site's metrics are estimated"" and, below that, ""Is this your site? Certify your site's metrics."" Some sites have certified their site metrics with Alexa, which means that Alexa uses direct first-party measurement for the site's traffic. However, this only means that Alexa measures the site's traffic correctly; the site's rank is still estimated since that relies on comparison with many other sites, most of which are estimated and not directly measured.
Paying users can access more data, including subdomain traffic.
If you want historical data, check for archives of the Alexa page on archive.is. If the website has a Wikipedia page with an infobox that includes the Alexa rank, you can check the history of the Wikipedia page to get historical Alexa rank data; however this is a tedious process.

,

The top of the page includes a ""Global rank"" and Rank in the country where the rank is highest. For websites in the top 100,000, historical data on global rank over the past year is also displayed. For others, there is space for the graph but it is not populated.
Other sections that show some information are: Audience Geography, engagement data, search traffic and keywords, upstream sites, linking sites, related sites, subdomains, load speed, site description, and audience demographics. The free version only shows the top five results for some of these categories; paying users can access longer lists.
Monthly Unique Visitor Metrics and sites people go to next are available to paying users.
Notably, there is no direct data on the number of visitors and pageviews available to non-paying users, even though the ranking is based on those metrics.

,

Alexa Internet shows a one-year history of the site rank, and moreover, does not show even this data for sites not in the top 100,000.
You can request archival of the existing profile using archive.is. Note that the archived page will not have the full functionality of the original page because of limitations in the way archival interacts with JavaScript.

,

Alexa's traffic estimates can be off from first-party measurements by a factor of three in either direction.
Since Alexa does not publicly release its traffic estimates, but only releases a rank, the rank should be treated as only a loose estimate.
Be particularly suspicious of Alexa giving a very good rank in a smaller country that has no direct connection with the subject matter at hand. This is usually due to Alexa's sample accidentally oversampling users in the country using the website.Given the inaccuracy of the rank estimates, the trend in rank as seen in the chart is also not necessarily accurate, although large fluctuations in rank usually contain some kernel of truth. As a general rule, you should believe such a trend only if it is consistent with other sources of evidence, or common sense about the annual traffic cycle. Some examples of correctly picked trends are annual cycles for charity evaluators such as GiveWelland the Effective Altruism Forum.The increase in traffic and improvement in rank is consistent with first-party data published for the sites,as well as with the general intuition that charity-related activity peaks around December/January (Giving Season).

,

The browser extension, also known as the Toolbar, is available for ChromeWith this extension, you will be able to, whenever you visit a website, view the SimilarWeb metrics from within your browser itself, without having to separately visit the Alexa Internet profile of the website. The extension does not give you access to any other information beyond what you can get from the profile -- it just makes the lookup process quicker.
In return, installing the extension means that you get included in the panel of users whose behavior is collected by Alexa Internet to estimate website traffic.

, Affiliate programs are networks in which you select from various advertisers. A few of the major search engines offer programs for advertising through them as well.

, Gear your ads towards who you want your visitors to be. They are more likely to bring you revenue if the ads are something they may be interested in.

, There are different types of ads that can be displayed on your website.


Pay per click is the most popular type of advertisement. Each advertiser pays differently and you are paid when visitors click on an ad.
Pay per impression pays according to the amount of times the ad is displayed on your website. This means that for every thousand times the ad is displayed, you get paid. Each advertiser pays differently but typically the amount will be small since all it takes is for someone to open your web page.
Pay per sale will generate the most money but it also does not happen as frequently as pay per click and pay per impression. This type of ad requires your visitor to not only click on the ad but purchase an item or sign up for a service.

,


Choose a banner style or text style ad. Banners are permanent ads that stay in a fixed position on your website. Text ads are temporary.
If you have chosen an affiliate program that does the work for you, ads will be placed on your website that match the content written on the page. This way, the ads are relating to your content and mostly are of interest to your readers.

, There are also webzines,(online-magazines), that specialize in articles, and have large memberships that will possibly read your article and hopefully follow a link to your site that you place with the article. Using this method causes links to your site from the sites you've put it on and results in more traffic.


Be wary of content farms. Google search is not nice to them.

, They are popping up at an ever-increasing rate. By socializing with others on the net through these sites, everything you join or participate in gives you more people to see your site. And, if you're selling stuff from your site, you'll want to go to the places (interest groups) on the social site where people are interested in what you're selling.

, These can be made quite easily with software you can get by searching on Google or by checking at the bottom of this article for a link. These can also be put on social sites and webzines for them. Again, wherever you put them causes a link back to your site.

Then you set up a feed for content and then go to other blogs with the same topics or fields of interests and read and comment on their articles. As well a lot allow you to post your article which gives you more traffic.

, There are sites that will send a news type story about your new product or info on your site to a lot of other sites. Some of these are pay sites though, so you have to watch out.

, Google Adwords is the most popular method for traffic. Since they are the top search engine right now it make sense to advertise there if you can afford it. You bid on keywords to get your site at the top of the search when your keyword comes up. There is more involved but it's all laid out at Google. There are a lot of other sites that use this advertising strategy called pay per click or PPC.

, Another popular way of getting traffic is with a search engine submitter, where a site will send your link to many search engines at once for a price. The more search engines you want to be on, the higher the price. There are a few free programs you can use but they usually don't submit to too many at once.

, These are supposed to be email addresses of people that have signed up to receive offers. You just have to watch that they have good fresh ""double opting"" leads of people who requested more information about your particular field or you could be marked as a spammer. Some of these sites will email them for you with your own email or you can buy separate leads and use a separate email site for the mailing. There are email programs you can use but then you have a problem that Internet providers usually only allow up to 500 emails per day, and if you're doing it every day they might (rightfully) accuse you of spamming and shut down your connection.

Data is calculated directly by Reddit using its server logs. From May 15, 2017 onward, Reddit disabled public access to traffic pages, but it may reinstate public access later, after incorporating mobile traffic data into the pages.Websites on the Stack Exchange network have some basic statistics reported at the Stack Exchange sites list. This is in addition to the traffic data you can see for most of these sites using Quantcast Measure. The Stack Exchange traffic list also includes some metrics specific to Stack Exchange (such as questions and answers) that are not reported by Quantcast Measure.,

For public companies, look for information in quarterly filings. For instance, Facebook's quarterly report includes a number of details about its userbase size, including Monthly Active Users (MAUs), Daily Active Users (DAUs), mobile MAUs, and mobile DAUs.Websites sometimes publish year-in-review, quarter-in-review, or other similar blog posts periodically with traffic metrics. Examples include charity evaluator GiveWell,pornographic video site Pornhub,and sharing/discussion site Reddit.In addition to looking for such reports on the website itself, look for them on the website of the publishing company that owns the website, if it is different (this distinction is particularly important for websites owned by a publishing conglomerate that owns many such websites).

, You may be able to use the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to get an estimate of when the page was last updated and how current the data is.

Some websites offer an email address for potential advertisers to get in touch with them. If you are an advertiser or can represent yourself as asking on behalf of an advertiser, you may be able to use email to get the website owners to share traffic data, or address questions about the nature of their audience.
Otherwise, try contacting the website owner or administrator asking for data, such as a Google Analytics data dump. There are two kinds of concerns you may ned to overcome: (a) unwillingness to share, and (b) effort of exporting data. You can reduce (b) by providing clear steps for how to export data, or even suggesting that they add your email account with ""View & Analyze"" permissions to their Google Analytics or equivalent solution. How you can overcome (a) is something you will need to figure out on a case-by-case basis.

Google Display Planner can be used to get traffic estimates for some websites.
We can use other ad networks sometimes.

Check the Wikipedia page about the website or associated organizations.,
Use web search (such as Google Search) and within-site search.",How to Get Traffic Analytics for a Website You Don't Own6,"

The Wikipedia page may have an infobox that contains entries with information about the traffic. This could include the Alexa rank.
The text of the Wikipedia page may have information about traffic. The information may be in the introduction, a section on traffic, or a history or growth section. Check the sources cited to determine the reliability and methodology.

,

You can search within the website by using the site: operator in Google Search, or use the site's own internal search engine.
You can search in publications that cover news in the domain of the website (using web search with the site: operator, or within-site search). For instance, for publisher websites, search in sources such as digiday.com, adexchanger.com, adweek.com, and adage.com. For technology companies, search in sources such as techcrunch.com and mashable.com.
You can search the whole Internet with a search term such as ""<domainname> pageviews"" or ""<domainname> traffic statistics"" (try both with and without quotes). Keep in mind that the top results are likely to be services such as Quantcast, SimilarWeb, or Alexa, plus other similar services and fake or paywalled services. You should probably check up to three pages of results.

Look for existing surveys that give an estimate of use.,
Consider conducting your own survey.",How to Get Traffic Analytics for a Website You Don't Own7,"

Survey data can generally help give an estimate of the number of users, and the average frequency of visits. They are too crude a tool to estimate the number of pageviews.
Surveys have both upsides and downsides. They rely on memory, and therefore tend to give more weight to visits to websites that the user remembers. This can be a positive, if we are trying to measure the extent of genuine, intentional and/or impactful visits, but it can also lead to underestimation of sites that have a less distinctive brand (for instance, websites that people visit from search results to quickly answer a question, but do not register mentally as a source).
You can get surveys related to Internet use at the Pew Internet website of the Pew Research Center.Another potential source is Public Knowledge (at publicknowledge.org).Another information source is the Wikimedia Foundation's Global Reach survey,with results so far for India,Nigeria,and Brazil., This is helpful if there are no existing surveys asking for information on usage of the site.

You can design an online survey using tools such as SurveyMonkey, Google Forms, or Qualtrics.
You can use tools like SurveyMonkey Audience, Google Surveys, or Survata to distribute your survey to a general Internet audience in the United States and a few other countries (Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom). This approach works best for sites that cater to a general audience and have huge enough overall traffic. As a heuristic, for a website that gets over 10 million visits a month from the United States, you should be able to get a positive number of responses to the question ""Have you visited this website?"" if distributing to 100 people.
Alternatively, you can distribute the survey to a more targeted audience by sharing it in a Facebook group or a subreddit that reaches that audience. This is most useful for websites that cater to that audience, so that you can extrapolate from the surveyed sample to the total population to get a decent estimate of website traffic.

Business cards are a good way to promote your site when you are offline. Add your website address and hand them out when you are in public. If you have friends and family, or even current clients or business associates, see if they do not mind handing out cards for you.;
,


You can create flyers with your website and information on it. Post it in public bulletin boards in places such as colleges, grocery stores and libraries.

Offering a discount for every referral can get the people that are viewing your signature to refer you.

,


Be friendly and put yourself out there. Meet new people and talk up your website. If people get really interested, you can always offer special incentives to them if they send their family and friends to your site.

,


This is a great place to start since you are already comfortable with them. Ask them if they can refer your website to their friends. Word of mouth is a great way to get free advertising.

Remember: for you to make money, people have to read your blog. Here are some popular blog genres:Personal blogs. Successful personal blogs almost give readers the impression that they know you. They can feel like a lunchtime chat with the blogger, or an insight into their daily life. If you are good at expressing your personality online, this could be a good genre for you.

For a good example, see “The Bloggess,” a blog that provides a humorous and entertaining look into the daily life of a woman with social anxiety.Special Interest Blogs. These blogs can offer tips and tricks about your favorite hobby. They can share knowledge about a topic you’re passionate about. These work especially well if you have a unique perspective you can bring to your topic.

For a good example, see “Curly Nikki,” a blog by a Black woman who is passionate about helping other women learn to love their natural hair.Another good example is the famous “Perez Hilton,” a phenomenally successful celebrity gossip blog focused on dishing the dirt about famous people.Industry Blogs. These are specialized to a particular field or industry. They’re a good choice if you’re already an expert on something and want to share that expertise. Because you have to constantly stay on top of new information and developments in that industry, you need to make sure you’re comfortable with researching and understanding your topic.

For a good example, see “The Copybot,” a marketing blog by copywriter Damien Farnworth. He tackles how to write the best copy for online sites with lots of concrete examples and helpful lists.Political Blogs. If you have an informed perspective on politics you’d like to share, or you want to communicate your political views in an interesting, entertaining way, a political blog could be a good choice for you. Political blogs often take a particular “side,” but they don’t have to.

For example, “PolitiFact.com” (a Pulitzer Prize-winning blog owned by the Tampa Bay Times) runs fact checks on important news stories of the day, assigning them a “truth meter” rating that helpfully breaks down inaccuracies in news reporting.Another example of a political blog is “Michelle Malkin,” a blog run by conservative pundit Michelle Malkin. This blog states the blogger’s personal political opinions in an engaging way.;
, The best blogs focus on topics that you, the blogger, are passionate about. This topic can be anything that you believe you have enough to say about to interest others. It works best if you can find a “niche” that is not being fully exploited.There are several important things to keep in mind when choosing your blog topic:Who is your audience? There are millions and millions of blogs in the world, so it’s crucial that you know exactly who your target audience is so you can draw them in.
What does that audience want? For example, if you’ve decided your audience is “stay at home moms,” you’ll need to consider the possible interests and needs of that demographic. Make sure you don’t just make assumptions. Look at other blogs that cater to your audience to see what they’re delivering.
How qualified are you? Good blogs convey a sense of familiarity and ease with the material. Excellent blogs usually have bloggers who are personally qualified to talk about their topics. If you can’t think of at least 25 separate posts off the top of your head about your topic, you may not have enough familiarity with the topic to keep your content going.
How sustainable is the topic? Make sure that you choose a topic that is likely to stay relevant in the future. You also need to be able to come up with new items to blog about on a very frequent basis. For this reason, try to avoid a topic that’s too narrow -- you’ll run out of things to say.
How much competition do you have? Do some research to determine what already exists about your topic. “Celebrity gossip” is a hugely popular topic, but there’s also a lot of existing competition that could mean your blog gets lost.
What is your ”spin”? To set yourself apart from the crowd, you’ll need to do something different and interesting with your content. Will you have an interactive focus? Focus on bizarre day-to-day news events instead of celebrity dish? Whatever you choose to blog about, make sure that you have ways to approach it creatively and that you can consistently offer new, exciting content.

, Your blog can be about anything, but once you have decided your general area of interest, such as “celebrities” or “parenting,” visit several popular blogs to see what they do. Pay attention to their blog design, what they blog about


For example, the blog “Tom + Lorenzo: Fabulous & Opinionated” began as a small blog recapping and critiquing episodes of Project Runway -- meaning that it had a built-in audience and clear purpose from the start. It’s grown into a pop culture site with millions of readers offering TV and movie reviews, fashion critiques, and celebrity news.An excellent example of a successful personal blog is “The Pioneer Woman,” a three-time Bloggie award winner. The blogger, Ree Drummond, now has her own show on the Food Network because of the attractive, “down-home” way she presents her recipes and lifestyle anecdotes.Three-time Bloggie award-winner “Camels and Chocolate” documents the travel experiences of a journalist, Kristin Luna, and her husband. Her accessible tone and beautiful photographs, coupled with her skill in telling a “story” about her trips, make it feel like the reader is on the trip with her.
Blogs can also take on a very particular, quirky lens. For example, “Crusoe the Celebrity Dachshund” won a 2014 Bloggie award. The blog is written as though Crusoe himself is writing it, and readers related to the lovable little dog and the concept of a dachshund talking about his grand adventures., Your domain name and blog title are your audience’s first exposure to your “brand identity.” In addition to letting readers know what to expect from your blog, your blog title and domain name will help place your blog in web searches, which is crucial for generating web traffic (and profit!).


Make sure that your blog title fits with your overall blog “identity.” For example, if you’re running a dishy celebrity gossip blog, don’t choose a stodgy or corporate-sounding title. On the other hand, if you’re an authority on a business topic, you don’t want your blog name to be too informal.Selecting a good keyword can be helpful. Search engines function through SEO (search engine optimization), which ranks search results based on how many keywords they have related to the person’s search query. However, you don’t want to get so wrapped up in SEO that your readers feel your blog is generic. Developing strong brand identity is the best thing you can do to draw readers to your blog.
For example, the hypothetical “haircare.com” tells readers what the blog is about, but it doesn’t offer any “angle” on what kinds of hair care advice your blog offers. The hypothetical “Frizzfighters.com” is still clearly about hair care, but it gives off a fun vibe through its alliterative name and communicates your strong brand identity (funky, focused on a particular hair issue, hip).
Choosing an extension is also important. The extension is the “.com,” “.net,” or “.org” after a website. There are now dozens of extensions, but those three are the most familiar to English-speaking audiences and will drive the most traffic to your website. Unless you’re a non-profit or a similar type of blog, don’t go for “.org” -- a “.com” is the top choice, followed by “.net.”

, There are a number of popular blogging platforms around, including Blogger and Wordpress. Most experts recommend WordPress because it makes monetizing very easy.WordPress.org is a highly popular choice because you don’t have to know any coding to design a slick blog. 1 in 5 websites use WordPress. Note: WordPress.org is a full-service blog hosting site, but you have to register your domain name and get set up with web hosting first. Wordpress.com has limited features and provides you a .wordpress domain name for free, but you can’t put advertising or affiliate links on a wordpress.com blog.Blogger is run by Google, and is a free hosting site that requires just a Google account to start. Its designs are not as slick as those on WordPress.
Other options include SquareSpace and Wix, which are website design platforms that will also allow you to create a blog.
Make sure to investigate whether your platform supports custom domain names. The best blogging platforms will help you register your domain name and seamlessly integrate it with your blog.
Each blog platform will walk you through creating a custom blog.

, It’s important that you create a design that reflects the content and image of your blog - from your font to your color choices, make sure each element of your blog's overall design is consistent with your blog's image.


For example, cartoony art and balloon fonts might be fun choices for a parenting blog, but would be seriously confusing on a professional marketing blog.
Consider hiring a professional designer, at least for your header and logo. You only get one chance to make a first impression.Most blog hosts, including Blogger and WordPress, have “themes” that you can install. These can sometimes be customized and give your blog a fun “feel.”

, Most blogs have common elements, such as “About Me” and “Archives” that allow readers to learn more about you and read past posts. Common features include:


About Me
Categories
Posts
Portfolio
Contact

, Don’t clutter your blog! Make it easy for readers to find the content they’re looking for. Offer helpful elements such as a search bar and “popular posts” sidebar.A “splash header” can be a good way to quickly orient new visitors. It is a large banner area at the top of the page that mentions the most important content and offers a quick introduction to the areas of the blog readers will be most interested in.Add a “next and previous posts” feature. One way to build your readership is to keep your visitors hanging around! Adding “next” and “previous” buttons at the bottom of each post will drive your visitors to read more content.

, Good blogs speak honestly and openly about a subject you're passionate about. Be yourself and share your ideas with the world!Be professional! Even if your blog is about your personal life, make it inviting for readers by making sure you don’t have any proofreading errors or ugly designs.
Be useful. Center your content on your reader, not yourself. This means that you consider what your audience can “get out of” each post. Look for a problem you can address, a question you can answer, or a story you can tell. Going on a five-page political rant may feel good, but it’s unlikely to create a valuable experience for most readers.Be personal. Writing in overblown academese won’t usually fly in blogs. Readers usually want to experience blogs as though they were having a conversation with the blogger. Develop your own sense of personal writing style and stick to it.

, Break your posts up into scannable “chunks” to invite readers to stay and read.For example, you can use a list format, or break your post up into short separate paragraphs. If you have a really long post, try using subheaders and block quotes to break up the text.
Other design elements, such bolding important points and using italics for emphasis, can draw readers to the most important stuff quickly.
Remember that most readers are not willing to invest a lot of time reading something online. Keep your posts easy to skim and still get the basic idea.

, You can have the best content in the world, but if your readers don’t recognize it instantly, it’s unlikely they’ll click through. Headlines are especially important because many readers will encounter your content through a feed reader, such as Google Reader, or content site like Digg. They may only see the headline at first, so it needs to communicate what your post will be about in an engaging, entertaining way.Create headlines that are useful but create a sense of urgency. You want your readers to feel like they need to discover this content.Play on readers’ emotions. You can do this by asking a question or challenging expectations. Sites such as UpWorthy are excellent at this type of headline, such as this real headline: “Most of These People do the Right Thing, But the Guys at the End? I Wish I Could Yell at Them.” Headlines like these tell a story and promise a surprise., Don’t announce your fabulous new blog only for readers to discover there are two lonely posts on it. Post 10-15 posts to start with, and queue another 10 or 15 to post on a regular basis.Consistency and quantity of content are crucial in developing a readership for your blog. If you don’t have a lot of content up when readers visit, they aren’t going to stick around or revisit.
You need to make sure that you post frequently. Prewriting posts and queuing them to post later is a good way to make sure that you have consistently updated content.

, Many blog readers subscribe to blogs through RSS feeds, which provide them automatic updates when you make a new post. Post a clear link or icon on your blog to let visitors know how to subscribe., Once you have the basics down, you’ll continue developing and learning more. It can take a long time for you to develop a big readership, so stay patient and keep posting., Register as a member using ""yourblogname.com"" as your username and post comments on related blogs This will drive traffic to your own blog.Build links to your blog by posting comments on other blogs that have “dofollow” links which means that search engines will see those links.
Don’t just hawk your blog in your comments! This can come across as selfish and spammy. Make your comments interesting and thoughtful. Remember, you’re making your first impression in the comment!

, If you’re a great writer with something to say, a guest post on another popular blog can be a helpful way to get your name out there. Check out some popular blogs in your genre and see if they have a guest post option.If you don’t see any information about guest posting, don’t despair. Read through the blog to see if there have been other guest posts. If there are, contact the blogger and explain who you are and what you’d like to write. If there aren’t, you can still contact the blogger to see if it’s something s/he would be interested in.

, Mentioning prominent figures in your area or genre can accomplish several things. It shows your readers you’re “in the know” about the important people in your field. It may also encourage the prominent figure to look at your blog, or even promote it to her/his own followers.Don’t just name-drop. Make sure to incorporate these names in an organic, purposeful way. For example, if you were writing a post about mommy blogging, mention a blogger who has interested you, or whose blog you find amazing.
Link, link, link! Link out blogs that you love in your own posts. Many bloggers track where their visits come from and may even visit (and link!) your blog in return., These days, if you’re not on social media, you’re missing out on major readership. Post a link to your latest article in your Twitter bio and ask for “retweets,” or link your content to your public Facebook page. Don’t just replicate the same content over and over, though. Use social media for quick, attention-grabbing posts and your blog for longer, more engaging content. The following are popular social media sites:Twitter
Facebook
LinkedIn
StumbleUpon
Digg
Reddit
Pinterest

, Giveaways are a great way to drive traffic to your blog. Readers love getting something for free! Giving away products from companies offers the free advertising, so contact some companies that are relevant to your blog and see whether they’d be interested in sponsoring a giveaway.You can also write to another blogger who sponsors great giveaways and ask for a contact or two.
Make it easy to enter the giveaway. Asking readers to leave a comment on a post with their name and contact information or asking them to republish a link on social media are good ways to drive entries.

, The newsletter may seem old-fashioned, but it’s actually a powerful marketing tool.There’s nothing like the power of directly connecting with people. Below are some other methods to consider:Add a link to your email signature inviting people to check out your latest post.
Send your blog post to people who might be interested in reading it. Don’t just spam your contacts here. Sending a link to your post to people (or other blogs) who might have a real interest in your content can get you new followers, especially if you offer to reciprocate by reading or reblogging their content.
Participate in blog carnivals. Search online for them or check out BlogCarnival.com.
Join a LinkedIn group. Particularly if you’re writing a more “professional” or industry-based blog, posting a blog in a targeted Linkedin group can gain you valuable exposure.

, SEO (search engine optimization) is very important, but it’s more than just repeating a bunch of keywords. Include a search-engine-friendly headline, such as “How to” or “Ways to.” Repeat significant keywords in your post, but make sure you don’t sound overly spammy.Google and most other search engines no longer operate strictly on SEO. They want to prioritize quality content, which means that providing clear, well-written, valuable content that links to other credible sources is your best bet.

, Creating a video for marketing is much easier than you think. The best software used for making a video is Animoto.

, Placing ads can be an excellent source of revenue for your blog. With “pay per click” (PPC) ads, you get paid when visitors to your blog click on ads that lead to other clients. You usually need to already have a strong readership and high visitor counts for ad buyers to be interested in your blog. Here are some examples of websites that pay you to place ads:Google’s AdSense program is the most widely used PPC program because it has the power of Google Search behind it. Google will read your article and find ""ads that are relevant"" to it and display them next to or within the article. It will also use your readers’ cookies to display ads that are relevant to their recently visited websites on your blog.You can also sign up for “cost per impressions” (CPM) ads. These function similarly to PPC, but they pay you based on units of “impressions” (views) the ad gets, even if the visitor doesn’t click on the link. Usually, the units are sets of 1,000 impressions.If you don’t have about 10,000 unique visitors to your site every month, you aren’t likely to make much money from ads. That’s why it’s crucial to build up your readership through marketing and quality content., Affiliate marketing is a very popular way of monetizing a blog because it capitalizes on your readers’ trust of you. If your posts always deliver quality content, then your audience is more likely to trust product or service recommendations. You can provide links or recommendations to relevant products and get a commission from any sales driven by your blog.Amazon Associates lets you place a banner on your website with products targeted at your audience, such as diapers for a parenting website or art supplies for a creative website. You earn a small commission when people buy something through your link. Amazon pays a commission ranging from 4% to 15%.
Amazon is the giant in the industry, but it’s also a good idea to reach out to small companies and even individuals who make products or services that are related to your blog. For example, if you have a popular cooking blog, you might contact small BBQ sauce companies to see if they’d be interested in setting up an affiliate marketing program with you. You earn a portion of the sale through your blog, and they get free marketing.You can also check out other affiliate programs at big “clearinghouse” sites such as Commission Junction, LinkShare, and ShareASale. These sites offer huge lists of programs, from which you can choose the ones relevant to your blog.An affiliate aggregator service, such as VigLink, will automatically insert monetized affiliate links into posts for you. They keep a higher percentage of the commission than other services, but the convenience may make up for it., If you already have a high visitor count, you may be able to get other companies to pay you to “sponsor” a post. The advertiser may contact you directly, or you can check out online “sponsorship marketplaces” such as ""themidgame"".Be careful about sponsors who want you to place an article to increase their own page rank. This violates Google’s policy and could hurt your AdSense revenue.You can also check out websites such as Blogsvertise, Social Spark, and Review Me for listings of paid or sponsored posts.Don’t allow sponsored posts to overtake your own content. Remember: your readers visit your blog to read your content.
Make sure that you only post sponsored posts that still benefit your readers in some way. You don’t want your blog to seem like a corporate shill.

, Working directly with a company to help with a promotional campaign can be a good way to boost traffic and revenue for your blog. Many companies, particularly ones like publishers, are happy to pay you to participate in things like Twitter parties, blog-based “book tours,” and giveaways.For example, if you run a popular blog where you review romance novels, contact various romance publishers to see if they’re interested in paying you for a review or other promotional event, like an author interview.
Signing up with third-party connecting agencies can be helpful. Blog Friendly PR, Blog Insiders, and Brandfluential are popular networks., This type of revenue comes from providing sales “leads” to other companies who partner with your blog. You don’t actually have to sell a product or service to generate these leads -- you just need your blog visitors to provide their information and opt in to being contacted by your partner.For example, if you run a popular DIY blog, you could partner with a home supply store. If your visitors agree to be contacted by the home supply store, you could get paid by the company for generating that “lead.”

, You may be able to use your blog to create freelance income by using it to showcase your work. Don’t use your blog only to sell products, but having a “portfolio” section on your blog can let readers see what you’re good at.For example, if you run a photography blog, keep a portfolio of your very best photographs and market yourself as a freelance photographer. Readers will know exactly what they’re getting because they can see your passion and expertise.
Blogs can also be very helpful even if you have a full-time “day job,” such as an attorney. For example, writing blog posts that offer helpful law advice and information will demonstrate to readers that you know your field. It will also give a sense of who you are personally, which is very important to prospective clients.

, Once you have a loyal following and have demonstrated your trustworthiness, you can consider adding “paid content” to your blog. For example, you could host a special podcast or write an e-book and charge visitors a small fee to access it.Paid courses, consulting services, and advice are other popular types of products and services you can use the reputation you’ve established to sell.You can also use a service such as Zazzle or CafePress to create branded items like t-shirts and tote bags for sale.The Bloggess creates new items weekly, usually playing on a humorous post from the week before.
Consider memberships, where you charge a small monthly fee for users to gain access to exclusive content, video content, or possibly direct access to you through Q&A or live events. WordPress has many plugins to help you add membership services to your blog.
Consider “bonus content.” For example, if you run a podcast on your blog, you might consider having the standard episode available for free but a longer version or additional content for a small fee. Dan Savage’s extremely popular “Savage Lovecast” runs on this model, where standard episodes are free and “magnum episodes” (longer, with no ads) are available for a subscription fee.Many bloggers parlay their blog’s success into books. The “Cake Wrecks” blog has several popular books of disastrous cake photos,and The Bloggess now has two books about her life adventures.The “Tom + Lorenzo” bloggers wrote a tongue-in-cheek “how to guide” to becoming a celebrity.Remember: anything you can offer that’s valuable to your readers might be worth them paying for. Just don’t let your blog become so paid-content-heavy that it doesn’t seem like a good value to your audience anymore."

Start with a good username.,
Your first video matters!,
Use photos and music that you have permission to use.,
Edit your videos!,
Get a channel banner.,
Once you gather some subscribers and views, apply for a YouTube partnership.,
As a vlogger, you'll be expected to upload daily or every other day.",How to Start a Successful Vlog," When you first create your YouTube account, you'll come across a little bar requesting your username. You may think nothing of it, go too quickly, or freak out, but either way, you need to fill this out. Make it memorable. Let's say you want to make your username EmmaSmith. week, shoot, with over a billion people on YouTube, that's taken. So you try EmmaSmith1. Darn, that's gone, too. So you get frustrated and make your username xXemmasmithaboo68958luvskittiezXx. Isn't that hard to read? It's also impossible to remember. You could have thought of something easier, like EmmaSmithLovesCats or EmmaSmithVlogging, or even just EmmaVlogs.


Use capital letters when necessary. Capital letters separate words and make your username easy to read. Even if your username really was xXEmmaSmithaboo68958LuvsKittiesXx, those capitals added make it easier to read. That doesn't mean that username is still acceptable, though. Keep your username as short as possible.
Cut down on Xs and numbers. They make your username harder to say and remember. You can cut down that long username to just EmmaSmithabooLuvsKitties, and now it's shorter and easier to remember.
On that note of a short username, adding ""aboo"" to your name probably isn't necessary. EmmaSmithLuvsKitties is even better. You can also shorten names to another form - instead of kitties, you could use cats. So now we have EmmaSmithLuvsCats. One more thing, though - people are bound to spell out Loves rather than Luvs, so go ahead and try out EmmaSmithLovesCats. Now we have a perfect username that's short and easy to type and remember.;
, Either get straight to the point and begin doing videos immediately, or start off with a video telling about what you'll be vlogging or a channel trailer. Make sure you have a tripod and a video recorder. Spend at least 100 dollars on a good video camera, with 720p quality or better to begin. If you have a newer iPhone, the video quality on those are great, too. Make sure you can see yourself somehow while recording, and look into the camera, not at yourself.

, Free image websites and royalty-free music have things that you can use as long as you credit the website somewhere (for some, crediting is not necessary). Subtle background music adds a nice speak to your videos, and if you want to become a YouTube partner, you can't use stolen images or music.

, Editing your videos adds appeal to your videos, which you'll need to grab viewers' attention. You can start off with Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, or if you're uploading on an Android device you can use the preinstalled Movie Maker. Learning to edit will also make it easier to make a channel banner, up next.

, A channel banner is the long strip at the top of your channel's page, and it's quite boring with nothing there. If you learn to edit, you can also make a banner for your page. To edit this, you can use Gimp for free, or buy Photoshop. Having a channel banner really adds spice to your page, which you'll want so people will keep watching. On that note, also have an avatar.

, This allows you to earn money from your videos. Being a YouTube partner also helps your fanbase grow. As a YouTube partner, ads will be put in your video, and you get money each time a person views that ad.

, Uploading as much as possible will make people want to subscribe, knowing that they'll get to watch something new from you often. Now you're on your way!

WordPress. The most popular free blogging platform, WordPress provides you plenty of templates and customizable features. If you want a more in depth control of your features and built in analytics, this is the best platform for a free blog.



 


Blogger. Google bought this popular blogging platform, and it is considered the most user-friendly option. It may not have as many customizable features as WordPress, but it is preferable for someone with fewer computer skills. Create a Google account, and click on the ""More"" tab to find the sign up on Google.com.






Tumblr. This is free blogging designed for visual artists and photographers. If you are excited about posting photos and videos, they can be combined seamlessly into the available templates.





;
,


Free blogging sites host a domain that leads with their website and includes your name on the URL. Services like WordPress and Blogger allow you to buy your domain name for $10 to $17 per year. Although this is not technically free, it is a good idea if you are blogging for professional reasons.

, Click on the option to start to sign up for a new account.

, Before your blog is available to the public, you will need to access your email and click on the verification link.

, Many people simply blog about what is relevant in their lives.


When in doubt, keep it short. People usually like to scan for topics that are important to them.

, Instead of listing blog posts by date, use the free options to categorize them by topic. Each post will apply to several topics.


Each blogging platform gives you the opportunity to associate different keywords with your post. These will help you categorize them for your blog and on search engines.

, Include a relevant picture in each post. Each platform allows you to change the position of the photo and its size, as well as keep a media library.


Keep a camera phone or camera with you at all times, so that you can get unique images for your posts.
Some people sort through Google images to find media that goes with their post. Beware of using copy written images in your blog.

, Add widgets to your blog that bring up Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn posts. This is especially important if you are trying to increase the number of followers or friends you have.

, You must remain consistent to encourage people to read your blog.

, Your blog should regularly cross-reference other interesting people so that it becomes a source for reliable and fun information.

, Create a conversation with each post.

, If you are writing a professional or hobby blog, giving your opinions on the industry will get more people to subscribe and read daily., Things that are in the news will bring more readers to your blog.

The most popular blogs involve people who can articulate a thought or argument. Make your main point early on in the article. Support it with evidence, such as links to news articles or photos.

, Many sites keep a comprehensive list of bloggers.


Blog directories can drive some traffic your way. Consider submitting to blog listing, blogarama and globe of blogs. Search for other options using your search engine.

Most importantly, have fun!",How to Start a Topical Blog," Whether that be current events in Europe or effective fishing techniques, try to find something that truly intrigues you. You can't start a successful blog without first being fascinated by what you're blogging about.;
, Once you've chosen a topic, research it. Go online, find many different websites to get information from, or go to your local library to search for books, preferably nonfiction pieces on that topic. Books and websites aren't your limited source of knowledge either, you can look through magazine articles, newspapers, and personal sources too. Maybe one of your friends or family members knows about what you're trying to write about. Ask them if they can sit down for an interview some time and get information that way.

, The best blog hosts to begin from are Wordpress, Blogger, and Tumblr. Choose a good blog hosting site and make sure you start with a good account username. If you don't want your own name being shown and don't want it looking anonymous for whatever reason, you might want to sign up with a fake pen name. If you're using Blogger, for example, create a fake Google account first (since Google is linked with Blogger) with a fake name and profile picture. If you don't mind your real name being shown, stick with an account you already have or use your own name and photo.

, It's best not to use numbers in your blog address, so if you find your first choice isn't available, try varying the way you write your URL until you find that it isn't taken. Example: first you try ""baileysrestaurant.blogspot.com"" and it's already taken. Try doing ""baileys_familyrestaurant.blogspot.com instead.

, ""Krista's Guide to a Vegan Lifestyle"" will look much better than ""Krista E. Stewart's Guide to Organic, Healthy Living Without Meat, Dairy, Eggs, or Artificial Additives.""

, Chances are you'll be able to change it later. When you go back, look through all the available templates and choose one that best illustrates your topic. If not, find a simple, inviting template that is aesthetically pleasing. Go for colors that set the mood for your topic. If you have an exciting topic, choose something eccentric like firehouse red or lime green. For more calm or serious topics, choose lighthearted colors like sky blue, beige, or midnight black.

, Add gadgets or widgets in places that look nice, try to keep similar widgets grouped together, and don't overcrowd. Add a good amount of entertaining widgets as well as basic widgets like hit counters and list of followers. Add recommendations of other blog links to show that you're interested in the blog community and throw in a fun poll to entertain your guests.

, Start off with a friendly introduction to your blog, explaining what is to be expected and when your upcoming posts are arriving.

, Explain your thoughts on your topic, elaborate on a news event, post interesting pictures, or whatever you think will be entertaining to read and will attract followers.

, Find a blog forum and offer to share links. Link your blog and offer to read and follow other blogs.

, Even if it is indexed it probably won't be on the first few page results for general keywords until it has gained significant popularity. To test if it is indexed, just type the blog address in the search engine and see if it comes up. If not, submit your URL to be indexed. This is especially easy to do on Google.

, If you have a Facebook, Twitter, Google + Friendster, etc. where people know you and will be interested in your blog, post up a link on your wall or profile.

, When commenting, link your blog for others to find. Comment thoughtfully, be courteous, and make sure the blogger knows you are genuinely interested.

, Don't take your blog too seriously, just stay on topic and keep things upbeat. Remember, this is mainly for you.

Pick your fandom!,
Make sure you have a great username.,
Use an awesome theme.,
Follow popular blogs that are in your fandom.,
Always tag your fandom posts.,
Post a lot of your fandom.",How to Run a Fandom Blog," Though there are some blogs that run a multi-fandom blog, it tends to be less confusing for everyone if you stick to one, maybe two at the max. Remember, you can always make another blog for your other fandom.;
, If someone is unsure what your blog is going to post about, they may not follow it. Don't be a name hoarder, who takes great usernames without using them, and don't beg someone for a username either.

, Either you make it yourself or use one someone else created, it should stand out and be beautiful. I don't advise using the free ones Tumblr already has. If you have good HTML skills, you can personalize it and add little graphics to make it more like your fandom.

, If you run a Supernatural blog, for example, try following blogs that have many followers and post Supernatural things you like and could reblog to get more followers.

, If you reblog or do something that relates to your fandom, always add a lot, almost excessive amount of tags. If someone is scrolling through those tags, they might see your post and follow you!

, Draw things, write fanfiction, or even join a roleplaying ring if that's something you're into. You do not have to post just things from your fandom. In fact, it's better if you don't, or someone may get bored and unfollow.

Have lots of updates.",How to Run a Successful Fashion Blog," Before anything else, you need to know what aspect or elements of the fashion world you want to blog about. It's a large industry and you don't want to make a pretense of trying to cover the whole thing. Pick a niche that is of interest to you, that you know a lot about and that inspires you to write about, keep learning about and share with others. While there are many possible ways to break down the fashion angle, here are some suggestions just to get you thinking about your own:


Fashion for mid to late teens
Fashion on the catwalks of Europe
Fashion for office work in big cities
Fashion for winter vacations
Fashion for babies and young children
Fashion on a budget
Fashion fixes for thrift shop finds, etc.;
, Many good blog names already exist, so you'll need to be very imaginative but with a little effort, it will be possible to come up with something of your own that stands out. Spend some time writing out lists of possible names, test them on family and friends and mull over the names for a few days before reaching a decision. If you're blogging with others, do a brainstorm session together.


Keep the name as short as possible without being dull.

, While the theme will obviously be focused on fashion, it's the design elements you'll need to customize. Make the design exciting and fun so the viewers will keep coming on the site from the start. Don't make it too busy, but equally, don't make it bland; find a balance that exudes elegance, confidence and simplicity. If you're not sure, hire a web designer to help you; this can be done easily through online sources.


Decide how large your images will be. Large images are preferred by those using portable digital media, as the screens are smaller. Small images tend to have less impact and important details can be easily lost.

, Do you have a main color or set of colors that you think work well for your fashion statement? Do test runs of different colors and combinations of colors to see what works best for your layout.


When choosing colors, bear in mind the fashion you'll be covering. Colors connote different meanings, such as gold and metallics for sophistication and evening fashion; pinks and pastels for girly or children's fashion; navy blues and dark colors for work fashion; and greens, blues and browns for eco-fashion.

, Headers help to break down the text and make for easier reading; they also allow you to draw the reader's eye quickly, allowing the reader to home in on what he or she is really interested in. The headers should match the theme and layout as perfectly as possible. As for font style, match it your readership, while accounting for ease of reading in the online context. Some fonts are better for a more quirky, younger and less sophisticated approach, while other fonts are better for the more serious-minded. Do your research before choosing.

, It is important that readers can quickly work out what your blog is about, and have these form a permanent part of the blog's layout. These statements should be short, to the point and as catchy/interesting as possible. The principal ones to develop include:


The byline under the blog's name. Usually a one to two liner, this should summarize the blog's purpose.
Profile. This is the chance to write a glowing background to the purpose of the blog and cool information about those behind it.
First post. This is a great place to explain the future direction of the blog. It can be linked on the side bar for those who wish to read it many months or years down the track.
Categories or tags. Do not neglect the categories or tags you're going to have. They need careful selection and naming, to make it easy for readers to pull together all posts on a particular topic or theme that interests them.
Don't be too simplistic. For example: ""A blog about fashion"" is a tad too broad.

, While sharing a blog can reduce the workload considerably and provide lots of interesting opinions, there are some key things to consider when making a decision to run a shared blog:


If you run it with one other person or with multiple people, this may turn out harder than you thought. This is because you have to constantly coordinate with at least one other person and be certain that he or she is keeping up his or her end of the bargain. You don't want to end up being the deadline nag.
Choose someone you can trust. If you get in a fight with this friend you will be letting the fans down and may have to delete the blog or let your friend take it over.
Choose someone who is as passionate about fashion as you are and who has a love of sharing ideas about it. He or she doesn't need to have the same ideas as you, although clashing all the time will cause readers to wonder why you decided to share a blog together!

, For example, you are solely responsible for meeting deadlines, ensuring that there is sufficient content each week and keeping on top of comments from your readers (you must interact with readers, or else they will feel that you're not interested in them, and they'll soon lose interest). You will need to keep coming up with fresh and interesting stories and angles. However, on the plus side, you have complete control and what you say, goes.

, Your first post should explain what the blog aims to do and what sort of fashion stories and opinions you'll be adding. This post can continue to inform readers to the blog for many years, so make it a good one, with clear explanations of the intended direction. This post can also identify your intentions as to how regularly you'll add posts; this is something that should be worked out at the beginning. While it can be changed later, it should be an indication of serious intent at this point.

, Write interesting posts which are fun to read and look at. Add plenty of images and perhaps include animations, videos and other enlivening aspects. Some things to bear in mind when writing posts:


Keep to your promised blog coverage. You won't win over readers by spinning yarns that veer away from the fashion topic. For example, if you're covering posh fashions and you happen to cover them at the local horse races, avoid discussing the merits of betting on horses.
Try to find exciting angles not already covered elsewhere. Your opinions also matter; readers want to read something different from the other blogs and news items about the fashion you're covering.
Use post headers that draw in the reader and make them want to know much more.
Always check your facts. Don't make things up and don't say mean things about people or you may not only upset your readers, but end up defaming people. You don't want to do that! (There are really good books and online information about avoiding such slip-ups on blogs; check them out.)
Be guided by the indications your readers give you. If they express a love of something you've written, produce more of it.
Place your name on the blog posts you produce if you're doing a shared blog. This allows readers to identify with each author and it helps you to grow your ""fan base"".
If you run this site with multiple people, make it clear that you want equal, or close to equal, amounts of posts on this blog. If someone gets lazy, consider a system of warnings before they're ditched completely. You don't have the time to be chasing someone constantly.

, Don't add the same styles and fashions to your blog. You can even try setting new trends as well as adding lots of pictures, tips, and possibly videos. You may want some new fashion updates or even contact some of the fans personally to keep them there.

, Images are the lifeblood of a blog focused on fashion; readers will want to see what you're talking about. It's really important to do the right thing by images too, including:


If you're taking images of your own, use a good camera and know the basics of taking great shots. The time taken to learn how to take good images will be paid back tenfold when your blog takes off.
If using someone else's images, be sure you have the permission or the copyright freedom to do so. Do not pinch pictures from elsewhere or you risk breaching copyright and getting yourself into a stink. Legal action isn't fun. If you have permission, make this clear and place any information or notice with the image that the person giving permission requests.
Keep a list of places you can get images from without having to ask for permission. Provided you're not running the blog for profit, this list will end up being quite large. However, as soon as you start making a profit from your blog, you'll need to be even more careful about where you source the images from; read all terms and conditions with care.
Consider teeing up with a blog written in another language. Share images with each other; this can allow both of you to source information from different countries and increase the interest in both blogs, without having to worry too much about losing readers to one another!

, Readers have short attention spans and if you skip a scheduled posting, they'll already be thinking ""has this blog closed down?"". If you do need to miss posts, be courteous and explain ahead of time why this will happen. People will understand that you have a life and that your interstate brother's wedding comes before a post being on time!

, Spreading the word is a very important part of running a blog or website successfully.


Get accounts on social media that will promote your blog. For example, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and Pinterest. Use a program that sends updates to these sites each time that you add a new post to the blog. Use fun, quirky and short lead-ins on these sites to entice people to click on the link and come and read your new posts.
Use forums to share blog content.
Post information about your website onto other sites or blogs. You can personally tell people about it and tell them to then spread the word, and you can even pass out flyers or business cards.

, Where possible, try to guest blog on other fashion blogs. This increases your outreach to new readers and gets your blog some exposure that will remain ongoing for as long as that blog exists/leaves your post intact. In turn, invite others to blog on your blog too. The reciprocity of guest blogging opens up lots of possibilities and spreads the word.

, You should be able to see your audience such as the people viewing at the second, the people viewed today, week, month, and all time. You should see the posts that they have viewed and how many views that post has gotten. You may also be able to see what viewers have typed on Google or other source sites to get to your blog. You may want to do some posts on those sources or keywords (traffic sources) to get more viewers coming on.

, Make sure that you are welcoming your fans instead of driving them away. You may want to change the appearance, or layout of your blog occasionally to keep it exciting, interesting, and fresh.

Make a blogging schedule.,
Schedule time each day to blog.,
Focus on creating new content.,
Give work to others.,
Respond to comments only once a day.,
Kick distractions to the curb.",How to Spend Less Time Blogging," Keep a calendar online or by your desk and log what posts you want to blog about on specific days. Give yourself deadlines like you would have at any job and, not only will you spend less time blogging, but you will become accountable to yourself.;
, Don't say that you'll blog at some point; set aside an hour or 2 each day, whether it's in the morning before work or at night before you go to bed, that is specifically for blogging. Setting a specific time each day to blog will keep you on schedule and maximize the use of your time. You might find that you actually feel like you have more time to do other things, since you are spending less time blogging.

, Keep a list of post ideas so you will always have a place to go for new topics. You will spend less time blogging if you don't have to think up a new idea every time you want to write something.

, If you find you don't have enough time to blog daily, hire some guest writers or cross-post something you wrote for another blog. Maybe you're not comfortable updating your blog's HTML, so find someone who can do that for you. You may have to spend a bit of money, but you'll spend less time blogging in the long run.

, Answering questions that your readers may ask in the comments can eat up a lot of your day. Instead of responding to your readers' comments as they come in, set aside a block of time each day specifically for addressing all of the comments that come in on any of your posts.

, Everyone is guilty of sneaking in an extra episode of their favorite TV show or wasting time on Facebook or Twitter when they should be writing. Shut off the TV and don't open a web browser until your blog post is finished. You will spend less time blogging if you don't stop every 5 minutes to answer an email.

Decide upon a domain name.,
Find a hosting site.,
Choose a blogging platform.,
Design your blog’s theme.,
Add your logo.,
Create an about page.,
Write a compelling post.,
Add more content.,
Set up a content schedule.,
Start an email list.,
Promote on social media.,
Interact with your readers.",How to Run a Blog for Your Creative Business," The domain is the part of the blog URL that comes after the www. It is descriptive of the kind of content your blog provides and should be easy to remember. Keep the name short and try to choose a keyword. For example, if your business is about sewing, www.planetsew.com or www.diamondsew.com is an informative link.Keep in mind that you’ll want this domain to be permanent. When you start over with a new domain, you have to start over with no ranking in search engines.
Use a search website such as Lean Domain Search to find available domain names.;
, Your business blog needs a place to store the all of your uploads, including images and blog posts. Some services and blog hosts, such as Wordpress, offer limited space for free. As your blog grows, you’ll need more storage space. Bluehost is one such site that offers hosting services for cheap and may help you easily link your account to your actual blog., Now you’ll need somewhere to display your blog posts. Sites such as Wordpress, Blogger, and Tumblr have different features and costs. Wordpress for example is highly popular, offers the most customization options, and is free to set up, making it good for small blogs., A good blog must look appealing to readers. If you or someone you know has graphical and coding expertise, you can make the design yourself. Otherwise, consider buying a custom design from a site like Creative Market or using a premade one from the blogging platform. Customize it to your liking.The design should be easy on the eyes and allow for all images and text to be easy to read.

, The bigger your business, the more you’ll want to have a logo. It should be prominently displayed at the top of your page. This logo needs to be easily recognizable so that viewers know who you are and can identify your brand. Sketch out designs on paper before you settle on one. You can even ask your blog readers for their opinions.For example, a cake designer may want the logo to look colorful with a cake or frosting incorporated into it. Italic, black letters on a white background may appear sophisticated and artistic.
Many designers make a logo out of their initials.

, The about page will tell your readers about you. What is your business about? Why did you start this business? What experience do you have in your industry? What do you offer? It is a good idea to add a personal photo and contact information to give your business blog a personal touch. This information may also be incorporated on the front page under the blog’s title..The personal photo can be used in the blog’s header in place of a logo.

, Once the blog is set up, it’s time to initiate it. The first post you make can be a test run, simply introducing yourself and your brand, but keep in mind what you want this blog to be. Start thinking of what you want and need to talk about in your posts to make your business successful and keep your readers coming back.Remember to always check your posts for grammatical and spelling mistakes.
Content for your blog might include stories that illustrate your passion for your chosen field, news about your business, and images of your products.

, Once you’ve initiated your blog, keep updating it with new posts. Talk about personal stories you have, such as learning your craft, your experiences opening a business, or how you developed your passion for that craft. Show pictures of your products and talk about how you made them. Talk about your values or trends in your industry. Write about business updates, promotions, news of new products, and giveaways.

It’s up to you how you update the blog, but remember that the end goal is to promote your business.

, In order to keep your blog fresh and at the top of search engines, you need to write content consistently. It’s a good idea to keep your blog updated at least once a week. Always try to introduce topics you wish to discuss and don’t forget to promote your brand by sharing yourself and your products.Making a content schedule may help keep you on track.
Consistency is key to building readership, so don’t delay writing until you’re sure you’ve got the perfect topic.

, Email lists are the easiest way to gain repeat visitors. Look at your blog service for ways to do this. On Wordpress, you can install a plugin or sign up for a service such as MailChimp. Your blog should have a box that your readers use to input their email address. Once the addresses are collected, you can easily send out updates to your readers.It is recommended that you send your emails using a service or official email address. Mail sent through your blog may end up in the spam folder of your readers’ inboxes.

, While email lists serve as open reminders to current readers, advertisements attract new readers. Set up an account on social media sites including Facebook and Twitter. Pinterest is important since it is a site about sharing creative products.Social media provides an opportunity to connect with people who will be interested in your business.
Remember to publish news of your blog posts along with a link when you update your blog.

, Your readers will leave comments on your blogs. Take the time to respond to them in a positive way. By doing this, you can answer questions and provide more of a personal connection with your readers. They may even give you useful feedback or new ideas for your blog.

This gives you an opportunity to build a customer base and develop relationships with people who can help your business, including other bloggers.

Understand the definition of ""keyword"".,
Use short keywords.,
Use keywords in the URL, title tag, and header tags on your page.",How to Increase Page Views1," If a website could be compared to a book, webpages are the pages that make up the book, and keywords describe the content you are promoting on a given page.;
, ""Party balloons,"" ""Calvin Klein t-shirts,"" and ""Game of Thrones on HBO"" are good examples of keywords.


The more concise your keywords, the easier it will be for users to find your content. However, prioritize clarity over conciseness. If you're creating a Game of Thrones fan site, your visitors would probably search for ""Game of Thrones"" instead ""Game Thrones.""
Don't get too specific. Your site might focus on a specific line of Hot Wheels cars, for example, but users not as familiar with particular products name (such as parents shopping for the items on Little Timmy's list to Santa) will likely think in general terms such as ""Hot Wheels cars"".

, The URL is the web address of a page. A title tag is the title you give a webpage, such as ""Blue Calvin Klein T-shirts"" or ""Order Party Balloons now!""/ Header tags are used to create section headers on a page, which help you organize content. For example, one header might be called ""Animal-themed Party Balloons"" while another could be called ""Blue Party Balloons.""


Website-creation software like WordPress and Adobe Dreamweaver let you create titles and headers without worrying about creating the HTML code that makes your website tick. All you need to worry about is creating succinct keywords and using them appropriately on relevant pages.

Focus each page on one keyword.,
Monitor your keyword density.,
Write keywords in different ways.,
Use keywords as links.",How to Increase Page Views2," Remember, ""keyword"" refers to a group of words that describe a product or service you want users to find.

, Around the advent of the World Wide Web, companies shot up the search results by stuffing each page with keywords. Now, companies like Google steer clear of pages obviously designed to appeal to their search engines. Insert your keyword once every paragraph or so.


A good way to judge keyword density is to use a keyword in writing as often as you'd use it in conversation with a friend. You wouldn't mention a specific product name every five words in normal conversation, so don't do it in your writing.

, A good way to insert keywords without tripping the keyword-density alarms used by search engines is to switch up the way you use your keyword. Use singular and plural forms, synonyms, and general terms.

, Attaching links to other pages on your site to mentions of keywords is a great way to drive page views. The second or third time you mention the keyword, attach a link to it that takes visitors to a relevant page on your site.

If you have the exact wording or phrase that is searched for, in your article, then it is likely to have a good ranking in the search engines for that specific search, and potentially get you more traffic.;
, Google provides a free service called 'Google Adwords', which provides you with a list of keywords, based on a word or phrase that you type into the text box on the page. The Google Adwords tool gives you a list of commonly searched words and phrases, associated to the topic you entered, and tells you the 'Global Monthly Searches' of the phrase.

, Ideally you should have this list next to you when you are writing your article.

, It is best to start the title with a keyword and not words such as 'A' or 'The'.

, These keywords should be included naturally and the article should read smoothly. One keyword for every paragraph is likely to be enough. Don't over use keywords (keyword stuffing) - Google will notice and your website is unlikely to benefit and may even be banned.

, Check that it reads naturally and doesn't sound as if loads of keywords are 'stuffed in'. Also check your punctuation and grammar. Your article is now ready to be published on your website or submitted to an article directory.

Think of what you want to blog about.,
Choose a blogging site.,
Think of your blog's name.,
Think of what you are going to write about first.",How to Write a Blog (Kids)1," Think of what you like to do much and what you're good at. You can also think of charities, blogs can be used in a campaign way, such as saying to donate money to you for the poor or to sign a petition. Blogs are mostly used to persuade people. Now pick your blog topic and move on.;
, You might want to try Wordpress, Blogspot, or Tumblr for short blog posts. Wordpress can be sometimes a bit confusing for kids, but Blogspot is recommended if you or your parents have an account on Gmail. Some blogging platforms are mostly easy to use, others are complicated sometimes, so choose what type you want.

, Choose your name based on what you are going to write about. For example, The Wood Carver for a blog about wood projects. Blog names are good ones, mostly when the name of the blog is up to three words, but feel free to use more words if you'd like.

, It could be a project, or a review, or almost about anything. If you are writing about games, you can write a blog post about a review on the latest games, or post about the latest gaming platform. Blog about things that are in the range of what your blog is all about. Write down your ideas on a piece of paper or in a notebook to save them for when the time comes to write.

Choose what type of blog you want to create.,
Decide how often you are going to post.,
Get some things together beforehand.,
Tell close friends about your blog and ask them to tell their friends.,
Look around the Internet for blogs that people love to read.,
Thoughtfully comment on other people's blogs.,
Read the terms of use attentively before using the blog's platform, once you start using the website; it will be considered that you accept their terms of use and agree to adhere to a policy.",How to Write a Famous Blog," Carve out a niche and pick a catchy title that captures the essence of your blog. Remember that a blog, like your clothes, is an extension of you. For most people, your blog site may be the only thing they identify you with and you want to be sure that who you are on the inside is reflected in your blog.;
, Some claim that posting at least once every day is best. Some also say that three quick posts a day are far more effective than one long post every three days. Yet others still claim that, when they update a blog every other day, they get more readers than when updating two or three entries in a single day. Write whenever you want – it's the content that matters! Whatever you do, remember that, for most bloggers, it's all about reading, and many of them would prefer quality over quantity. Once you get started, you'll find that you attract a certain readership, and you may have to adjust how you work your journal to appease and keep the readers you've obtained.

, Some recommend putting together about a month's worth of material before you tell anyone about your blog. It is recommended that you just start writing and fame will come in time. Feel free to go back and rewrite entries to make everything just the way you want before or after you ""go public."" You can edit any entry at any time with most blog sites. Writing a popular blog doesn't happen overnight. The essence of the blog stems from making journals which means the blog is FOR YOU. Work it how you feel is most appropriate.

, Often, if you use it as another way to network with people around you, you'll get a better response. If you push it too hard, don't be surprised if they ignore your blog, because they may feel you're fishing for compliments and attention...remember, blogging is about you, and the more attention you put into yourself, the more people are going to notice.

, Read and post to them religiously. Leave a note that actually has something to do with their site so that they know you actually took the time to pay attention to the material posted. Do not expect anything back in return. Just commenting will cause others to be more likely to visit your blog and do the same. Often, when you make comments to sites, a link to your own personal site will already be included with your comment, unless you are posting from one hosting site to the next. If you're at ITW and you read a blog on Myspace, then it would be appropriate to include such a link.

, On most blogger sites, a link to your own blog will be automatically included in your comment. So the more blogs you post on, the more people will be driven to visit your blog. Of course, don't just go on and post one-word spam, because that might keep people away.

, IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THEIR TERMS OF USE, DO NOT USE THE SITE.

Find yourself a blog-hosting site.,
Choose a fictional world that will appeal to you and that you won't lose interest in.,
Choose the right character.,
Write out a story arc.,
Find your market.",How to Write a Fictional Blog," Just as with any blog, the first and most important step is choosing a site that will best suit your needs. Some great places to start are Blogger.com, Typepad.com, and LiveJournal.com.;
, One easy place to start is with a world that has already been created--that way you have a landscape, characters, and a history pre-made and ready to build on. If you are a fan of the Star Wars Galaxy or the Gilmore Girls TV show, you could choose one of these worlds as a framework into which you can insert your blogging persona. Or, if you want to make up your own world, spend some time thinking up the rules that you're going to play by before you start writing, so you can narrow down the scope of your project so that it's more manageable.

, Be careful not to pigeonhole yourself too much, because you're going to be stuck with this character for a long time! The trick is to pick someone who's enough like yourself that when you sit down to write an entry, you'll be able to get inside that character's head and write as if you were them. Remember, this isn't just a short story you're writing, it's a blog, so you need to be able to write your entries as if they're the diary entries of a real person. The more natural your character seems, the better.

, Spend some time working out what you want the overall direction of your story to be. This doesn't mean you have to put down every little detail before you start posting entries, but it really helps to have an idea of where you're going with your story, rather than making it up on the fly. As a fictional blogger, you don't have the luxury that other bloggers have of being able to sit down and report the events of the day as they happened--you have to make that part up, and it helps a lot if you know in advance what you want to happen in the long run.

, Once you're ready to develop a readership, have a look for the sorts of people who might be interested in your fictional blog. Your friends and family are a great place to start, but you might also want to look for online communities that specialize in the subject matter you're writing about. If you're writing a fictional blog about the Star Wars Universe, let people on Star Wars message boards or fan sites know about your blog. If your blog is set in a fantasy world, spend some time looking for online communities that are interested in new fantasy literature.

Look for a class action.,
Contact a lawyer.",How to Report False Advertising," False advertising can take many forms. Billboards, TV commercials, and web pop-ups can all be false or misleading. False advertising often involves claims about the health, safety, effectiveness, or cost of goods or services. To quickly check whether the advertising was illegal, see if you can answer “yes” to all three questions:Did the ad promise the viewer something?
Would a “reasonable consumer” be misled by the claim?
Was the promise something a consumer would find important (that is, was it material to their decision to buy?);
, You should try to hold onto evidence of the false advertising. If the advertisement was printed (in a magazine or newspaper), then cut it out. Alternately, you can preserve TV advertisements if you have recorded them.


If you can’t retrieve a pop-up ad, for example, then write down your memory of its contents. Although this is not as ideal as having the pop-up to show to someone, it is the best that you can do.

, You can always contact the company and ask for a refund. Call the company (or stop in and visit). You will need your receipt, to either show the sales clerk or to reference when calling. To find a phone number, visit the company’s website and look for a contact.If the first person you talk to can’t help, then request to be connected to a supervisor. Always remain polite yet insistent. Tell whoever you speak to that the product does not work as advertised and that you want a refund.
Even if you speak to someone on the phone, you should also send a letter. Send it certified mail, return receipt requested so that you will have evidence that it has been received.
If you don’t know what to write, you can use the Federal Trade Commission’s sample complaint letter, which is available at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0296-sample-consumer-complaint-letter.
For additional advice on how to get a refund, see Protest and Complain to Receive a Refund.

, If the company responds back in writing, then hold onto the letter. Also hold onto copies of any letters that you send the company. Staple the signed return receipt to your copy of the letter.


If you talk to someone on the phone, then write down their name and the time of the call. Also summarize the substance of your conversation.

, No single federal agency collects all complaints for false advertising. Instead, you must contact specific federal agencies depending on the type of business you are complaining about. For example, to complain about an airline’s false advertising, then you would need to contact the U.S. Department of Transportation.By contrast, if you want to report false advertising engaged in by the makers of dietary supplements, then you will need to contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).The Truth in Advertising website contains a list of industries and links to the appropriate federal agency you should complain to.

, Each agency will ask for different information. You should be prepared to identify the name and location of the company as well as what was false or deceptive about the advertisement.


If you need to report to the FTC, then visit its website at www.ftc.gov and click on “File a Consumer Complaint.” You will be taken to the FTC’s complaint assistant.
At the assistant, you should select a Category. Most false advertising complaints will fall under “Other.” Click on that category.
You can then click on the relevant sub-category. To report false advertising in relation to automobiles, then click on that subcategory. If you don’t know what subcategory to select, then choose “No Match Found.”
The complaint assistant will walk you through a series of questions. Provide the information that is applicable. For example, you will be asked how much you paid the company, the method of payment, and the name of any company representative you have contacted.If you need to ask questions, you can contact technical support via chat. You can chat between Monday and Friday, 9:00 am to 8:00 pm Eastern Standard Time., Every state has an agency that investigates reports of false advertising. In most states, that agency is the Attorney General’s Office or a Bureau of Consumer Protection.Many cities also have agencies that investigate allegations of false advertising.

To find your applicable agency, type “false advertising” or “consumer protection” with your state or city into your favorite web browser.
The Truth in Advertising website also maintains a listing of state resources, complete with links. You can find this information on their website; search “state-by-state” once at the homepage., You will need much of the same information that you will need when reporting to a federal agency: the name and location of the business as well as the nature of the false advertising (why is it false?). In New York City, you can report false advertising to the Consumer Assistance division at http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2911/false-advertising-complaint.


At the New York City website, you must select the category of business that engaged in the false advertising, e.g., gas station, grocery store, parking garage, etc.
Provide the “what, where, and who.” In other words, provide details about the false advertising, state the location where it occurred, and then identify the name of the business.Be sure to have a copy of the advertisement that you can send to the agency., The BBB was created to collect complaints about false or deceptive advertising.

After you file a complaint, BBB will reach out to the business for a response. To contact the BBB, you can visit their website and then type your city and state or your postal code.

You can then click on “File a Complaint.”
You will need to answer a series of questions about the business and about yourself. For example, you will be asked whether you are a citizen of the U.S. or Canada and if you are in the military.
Select “Your complaint involved a: business’s advertising” to complain about the false advertising. Then select the business and provide all relevant details about your complaint.

, The truthinadvertising.org (TINA) website collects information about false and deceptive marketing. You can either file a complaint online or download a complaint form. Once you have completed your form, you can send it to TINA in one of two ways:You can fax the completed form to (203) 421-6211.
Also, you can mail the form to Truth in Advertising, Inc., P.O. Box 927, Madison, CT 06443.

, When a company refuses to refund the cost of the goods or services, then you might want to consider bringing a lawsuit. If you sue, you can generally only recover the amount of money that you lost because of the false advertising. Often, this is only the cost of the product or service that you paid for. When you paid $50 for a clock, then you might not think it is worth your time to bring a lawsuit in order to recover $50.


There are exceptions. For example, some states grant consumers the power to seek “punitive damages.” Punitive damages are above and beyond the economic loss you suffered and are designed to punish the defendant. Not all states allow punitive damages for false advertising claims. But when a state does, then you might want to bring a lawsuit.Furthermore, you might be able to recover for consequential damages caused by the false advertising. For example, if you purchased an over-the-counter medicine but then suffered severe complications from using it, then you could recover for medical bills and any loss of quality of life. This could run into the tens of thousands of dollars and would make a lawsuit worthwhile.

, Many false advertising cases are brought as class actions. A class action allows people who have claims for small dollar amounts to pool together and sue a defendant. Often, the attorneys representing the class work on contingency and take a portion (around 40%) of the money awarded to the class.You can search for class actions that are ongoing. Also, some class actions have settled and you will be able to seek reimbursement if you qualify.
For more information on how to find class actions, you can see Find a List of Class Action Lawsuits.

, Only a lawyer can advise you on the details of your state law and whether or not a lawsuit is feasible. The lawyer could direct you to a current class action lawsuit to join. Or the lawyer can review the extent of your damages and recommend that you bring an individual lawsuit.


To find a consumer protection attorney, you should contact your state’s bar association. Most states run lawyer referral programs. You can request the name of a lawyer who has handled false advertising claims before. You can then set up a consultation where you can discuss the merits of your lawsuit.
Some states allow consumers to recover attorneys’ fees if they win the lawsuit. This might make an individual lawsuit even more attractive. If you win, then you won’t even have to pay for your lawyer.

Some of the sample websites like on Wordpress, have their own names and pictures, etc. Don't use the names they already have on the sample website you choose, but use your real title and take away all the photos and paragraphs that are part of the sample website. Add your own.

, Make a good blog post title, it's your first blog post so make it look attractive! Write from your heart, write what you know about and what  you want to say. Blogging is all about being able to write your opinion on something, but don't be too harsh or too boring.

Ask permission from your parents first. You could get in trouble if you transact money without permission from an adult.

, If your parents or you have a Facebook account, for example, ask them to post a link to your blog and tell their friends about it.


Adults surely will like the idea of a kid blogging; they think it is cute and terrific for a kid to blog.
Tell your friends that you have a blog, and put attractive flyers in peoples' mailboxes around your neighborhood. Be happy that you made your first blog post! Remember to update your blog at least once a week, or else people will get bored of it and stop viewing it. Consider it as a chore, but still enjoy it!

,, If writing these articles for someone else, they may have a density requirement for each keyword that you need to meet. Most webmasters want a frequency of at least 1% per article, which averages out to five uses of each keyword when writing the average 500 word article.

, Keyword articles should have a general intro, a few paragraphs for the body and a conclusion. Keyword articles can end up not making much sense if you focus only on adding the keywords, so make sure the outline specifies pertinent information that's useful to the reader.

, This way you can quickly reference your research in one place without having to spend hours browsing the Internet for information.

, Once you've got the article outlined, all you need to do is type it. There are plenty of free online programs that help you practice typing to increase your speed. If you don't type at least 70 words per minute, you'll find that your article writing takes much longer.

By expanding on the blog topics that have generated lots of comments, you can potentially draw more traffic to your blog.


Review your blog dashboard to locate all your blog posts that have generated the highest amount of user comments.;
, If you can identify a specific theme across blog posts that generate the most comments, you can write additional blog posts on that particular theme. For example, if you discover that multiple comments were left for blog posts that featured ""top ten"" lists, write more posts that feature ""top ten"" lists.


For help with determining common themes or hot topics in the blog posts with the most comments, review the names of the tags or categories you have assigned to your blog posts, if applicable.

, Sometimes, your blog posts may be generating comments if your audience enjoys the layout and format of your blog post. For example, if multiple comments are left on posts that are easily scannable and feature bullet points, write more blog posts using this format.

, In some cases, users will post rhetorical questions or interesting thoughts in the comments section that can be used to create new blog posts. For example, if you write a blog about politics, review questions posted by users in the comments section that mention or discuss political controversies and arguments, then generate new posts on these topics.

, Any ongoing arguments or hot discussions can be used to expand on a particular topic in a new blog post. For example, if the comments section contains arguments among users about the legalization of birth control, create new blog posts that discuss the pros and cons of legalizing birth control.

, A guest post is a blog post written by a user other than yourself. For example, if you run a book review blog and an author commented on the difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" book reviews, ask the author if they would like to write a blog post about the topic that you can feature on your blog.

, Sometimes, commenting or replying to other users on your own blog can provoke additional discussion. For example, if users mention their favorite types of meals on your food or cooking blog, post a comment that asks your audience to share their favorite recipes, then create a blog post that discusses favorite recipes.

, Sometimes, writing one blog post about a hot or controversial topic can generate multiple ideas for future topics based on the comments your readers leave. Examples of topics that are likely to generate comments are politics, religion, death, fears, and failures.

Be assured that you don’t need to be a Shakespeare to be able to write that awesome copy.,

Ensure that your blog is able to handle the sudden surge in traffic.",How to Write Copy That Clicks," If you’ve chosen a niche that you’re passionate about, and are confident that you have value information to share with others, readable writing will just flow.


A great copy is one that is visited a lot and shared a lot on social circles. One way of checking if your copy is actually doing well is to check your visitor’s duration of visit on your website.;
, Make that heading a catchy one! It will do wonders for your blog. How? Take this small test: Which one of these headings would you click on: “5 Ways to Seduce Google Into Ranking Your Website Higher” or just plain “How to Rank High on Google Search”. The first one, right? Point proven…

, Okay, so the heading was catchy enough to make visitors click on it and land on your page. What next? Pique the reader’s interest with the first few lines on your post. These opening lines should have the ability to capture their attention and persuade them to read the rest of the blog.

, Cliffhangers are what make the readers read on till the end of the post. These are statements or words that stitch a post together through emotions. This is applicable especially for longer posts (800 plus words). Insert cliffhangers to make sure that your visitors are hanging on, and enjoying every bit of your post.

, Have you ever watched one of those movies that have a great title, and the storyline is even better? Throughout the one and a half hour long movie, you’re glued to your seat and you’re loving every bit of it. And then it abruptly ends, out of the blue! It’s almost cruel! You’re so irritated that if you ever meet the director, you will be sure to express your annoyance! Don’t let that happen with your blog post. Give your readers a proper closure. After all, you don’t want them to get irritated and bounce off your blog, do you?

, All of your efforts to create a great copy will go to waste if your grammar is not in place. There’s nothing more irritating to the reader than grammatically incorrect sentences. Make sure you’ve got your basics right, and that your sentence structure is logical.

, Garnishing is important as it makes your masterpiece look awesome. While writing blogs, images serve as the garnishing agent. Choose images that are in tandem with your content, and are visually appealing as well.

Understand the brand.,
Research other slogans.,
Think about your brand’s placement in the market.,
Write down everything that comes to your head.,
Pick your five best slogans.,
Describe the brand in one sentence.,
Find the story.,
Keep your slogan pithy.Your slogan needs to say a lot with a little.,
Make it memorable.,
Keep it short.,
Make your slogan honest.",How to Write Slogans," Before you actually write anything down, it’s best to research the brand you are writing the slogan for. Get information from the website, ask the employees of the company for history on the brand, how long the company has been around, what has been tried before, etc.


You want to develop an intimate knowledge on the company and brand. Figure out who the target demographic is, what’s the voice and tone of the company, and what the company is selling.Your slogan is meant to differentiate you from the competition while conveying a brand’s overall mission. Research what makes your company or brand different.
Narrow down what the key benefit of the product or brand is. Once you have a single idea of what this is, you can start to throw around ideas for how to say it in a fun and memorable way.;
, Look at popular slogans, the slogans of competitor companies, and think about what slogans you just remember that were popular or catchy. You don’t want to copy someone else’s slogan, but understanding what has and has not worked in the past will benefit you.Think about some of the most iconic slogans. Slogans like “Just do it” “Think different” “I’m lovin’ it”. These slogans have a few aspects in common that make them successful. Each slogan here is short and memorable. These slogans also impart a positive feeling about the brand, while differentiating it from competitive brands.
Nike’s “Just do it” slogan resonates and inspires you to get out and take action. It transcends the athletic world as well, giving you the positive feeling that you tackle any obstacle in any situation.
Apple’s “Think different” not only pays homage to all of the visionaries in our history who have challenged the status quo to bring the world forward, but it speaks directly to competitor (at the time) IBM’s “Think IBM” slogan. This slogan shows us that being unique is good, and that Apple is more than just a computer company.
McDonald’s “I’m lovin’ it” generates a positive feeling towards food that’s not good for you. There are no false claims about health, just a promise that you’ll love the taste.
When writing your slogan, keep in mind length, key benefits, and how your slogan will make people feel good about this brand, which is different from the others.
Look at word count, the overall message, the rhythm, and even if there’s humor.

, This means taking an honest and objective look at the brand’s recognition and influence.The slogan you write should reflect your brand’s influence. For example, if you’re writing a slogan for a new company that isn’t widely known, it should be an informative teaser of what this company can offer. If the company is reputable, then you need to ask yourself why there is a change. Is the company going in a new direction? Is the new slogan part of a re-brand?
Take a company like Porsche, the slogan for Porsche is: “There is no substitute”. This works because Porsche has years of quality craftsmanship to back up that claim and level of luxury.
Also think about what the overall product is. If the product is something fun, then a serious or authoritative slogan might not be best.

, If you’re working with a team, start throwing out ideas to each other. Oftentimes something that you think of or say may sound silly at first, but it can be the seed of a larger idea.


Try not to edit yourself here. Now that you have information on the company’s goals and mission statement, you want to throw a wide net and come up with as many ideas as possible.
While the end product of your slogan should be short, it’s ok to have a longer sentence or rhyme at the beginning.

, Narrow down what you have come up with so that you have five options to work with. These slogans won’t be the final product, but they’re a good starting point.


What you probably will, and should have now, are five long, possibly awkwardly phrased messages, but that’s ok. You’re narrowing down the ideas into something that you can build on.
Don’t worry too much about being stuck with the slogans you’ve picked. As you continue to write and rewrite you may come up with a whole new idea. That’s fine, right now you’re just trying to find something that fits with what the company or brand is selling.

, What is the brand’s value proposition? A value proposition is a brief description that clearly states the benefit you provide, for whom you provide it, and you do it well and in a unique way.You’re not writing your slogan just yet. But by narrowing down your value proposition and being able to describe it in a quick, clear fashion, you can start to find an angle for your slogan.
Try to be able to describe your brand with as few words as possible. This isn’t always easy, but it will force you to think about what’s relevant and important, and what might be unnecessary information.

, By now, you should know the history of the brand, be able to present its value proposition in a quick and engaging way, and you should have several rough taglines written down. Compile all of this information and see what common threads tell the story.


Don’t just look to brands and companies for inspiration when finding the story, look at actual stories. Movies and books are great for looking at taglines because they have to get you excited about an entire story in a very limited amount of time.
Finding the story of your brand using all of the information you have, will give you a narrative which you can use to help create a teaser that will engage people and help them remember your brand., Think about who the consumers are, and get inside their heads.


When a consumer is considering your product, your slogan will consciously or subconsciously be remembered. Look at Taco Bell’s “Think outside the bun”. When you want a quick bite you run through your options in your head. Taco Bell has an effective angle because it reminds you that there are other options besides a burger. You want to highlight a key benefit, which in this case, is that you have an alternate option.You want your slogan to position your brand to motivate people.Look at Nike, which has had the same, simple slogan since 1988: “Just Do It”. It’s simple and motivating, playing into an athlete’s basic drive to simply perform well and break through barriers.

, Rhyme, rhythm, and brevity are your friend when writing slogans.When a slogan has a rhythm or a ring to it, it’s much easier to remember.


Look at Bounty’s “The quilted quicker picker upper.” The alliteration and natural rhythm of this slogan achieves several goals. It tells you why this product is of a certain quality, what it does, and the fun, light tone is easy to remember and repeat.
It’s not always easy to get creative, and to be creative effectively, so if you’re having trouble, see if you can make a rhyme or a tune to your slogan.

, This has been said a lot, but it’s important. Once you’ve written a few slogans, take a break and let it all digest. Then come back to them and see if you can edit them down further.


Think about email subject lines, these are like slogans for an email. Studies show that subject lines with around 50 characters or that are six to nine words have a higher open rate.Keeping your slogans short can also create a bit of mystery that entices people to research on their own. And if you can get your brand’s message out quickly, you’ll get people’s attention. Take Apple’s slogan: “Think different.” Two words that immediately inspire you and conjure up all of the possibilities that you can experience with an Apple product.

, During the entire process, you want to stay honest, but once you’ve written your slogan or slogans, take an objective look and ask yourself if this is an honest and accurate representation of the brand.


Avoid hyperbole like “No. 1” or “The best”. These phrases are probably not true, and this kind of language is also not creative.
Your slogan gets people’s attention and helps consumers to remember your brand, don’t promise something that can’t be backed up.

Decide where to publish the ad.,
Tailor it to your audience.,
Write an attention-grabbing headline.,
Don't start with a question.,
Write a bridge to keep them reading.,
Create desire for your product.,
Tell them how to get your product.",How to Write an Advertisement1," Will your advertisement be printed in the newspaper, a magazine, your website, or Facebook? Knowing where you plan to publish the ad will influence the way you write your copy. Find out the perimeters of your advertising space, including how many words you're allotted, how large the font size will be, and whether you can incorporate graphics or video. Ultimately, the traditional classifieds-style ad will fly in almost any medium, but you might need to make small tweaks to tailor it to the space in which you're advertising.


If you're taking out a quarter to full-page advertisement in your local newspaper, you're going to have some room to play around with a paragraph or so of copy.
However, for a Facebook or other online ad, your copy will be limited to a sentence or so.
Either way, when you're writing an ad, every word counts. Being too vague or wordy will cause people to skim your advertisement instead of pausing to read it, so the same writing tenets apply no matter what type of ad you're writing.;
, Which consumers are you targeting? Ideally, everyone who reads your ad will want to buy your product, but in reality you'll have better results if you tailor your ad to a specific audience that is likely to be more interested than the rest of the world. Use language and references that appeal to the demographic to which your product appeals. It might be a turnoff for other groups of people, but it's important to speak to the hearts of the people who have the potential to become loyal customers.


For example, if you're selling a service that allows people to self publish their books, you'll want to use language that sounds writerly and elegant. That way your target audience - people who have written books they want to publish - will know they would be in good hands with your company.
If you're selling a product that appeals to a younger crowd, like a new type of candy that makes your mouth turn rainbow colors, lose the formality and use language that's familiar to your target audience - kids who want to spend their allowance on candy, or who could influence their parents to buy the candy for them.

, This is the most important part of your advertisement, because it's your one shot at getting consumers to actually read your ad. If your headline is vague, difficult to understand or in any way uninteresting, you can't expect people to take the time to read the rest of your carefully-written ad. You're immediately telling them that your company isn't innovative enough to come up with a compelling ad - which will reflect poorly on your product as well, even if it's excellent.


People riding the subway, scrolling through Facebook or flipping through a magazine have hundreds of little pulls on their attention. How can you cut through all the noise and make them focus on your product? Think of a headline so compelling that it essentially forces the person reading it to pay attention.
Your headline could be something shocking, strange, emotionally compelling, or exciting - it doesn't matter, as long as it grabs the reader. For example,

Write something mysterious: Don't be happy, be terrified.

Write something people can't pass up: Get 75% off a ticket to Paris.

Write something emotional: She has 2 weeks to live.




, You might be able to get away with a highly creative and compelling rhetorical question, but stay away from your standard ""Do you need a new car?"" type of opener. Consumers have already read thousands of similar questions, and they're tired of being asked. You'll have to dig a little deeper to capture their attention. Find a creative way to tell people that you have what they need without asking an obvious question.

, The next line after your headline is your short, sweet chance to create a solid impression of your company in the minds of your audience. After your mysterious/shocking/emotional headline, you need to follow up with something substantive - otherwise, your headline will be perceived as mere hype.Use the bridge to tell the consumer what need your product can fill.


Remember that every word counts. Your bridge language needs to be just as compelling as your headline, because there's still a good chance you could lose people before they get to the end of your ad.
Touch on the major benefits your product will bring the consumer.Your bridge should contain your strongest selling points.

, Your bridge also serves as a chance to create a strong desire for your product. It's a chance to play with your audience's emotions and make them feel as though your product will fill a need they have. If this sounds manipulative, it is - but if you're offering a product that will actually be helpful to people, there's no shame in writing copy that tugs on the heartstrings to get people to buy a product that will improve their lives.


Nostalgia can be an effective tool to capture people's hearts. For example, We use the finest heirloom peppers to make hot sauce as good as Grandpa's secret recipe.

Playing to people's health concerns can also work well: You're doing the hard work - quitting. Let us help you get your life back.

Don't forget to include the name of your company and your product somewhere in your copy.

, Finally, write a strong ending that tells your audience exactly what to do next. Give them an action to take that makes it easy for them to buy your product or get in touch.


It's common for ads to include a straightforward directive, like Call 555-5555 for more information.

You could also just list your website, and people will know to go there to buy your product.

Dissect bad ads.,
Make it sound natural.,
Keep it brief.,
Consider using testimonials.,
Use graphics wisely.,
Record yourself saying it aloud.,
Test your ad.,
Rewrite it until it works.",How to Write an Advertisement2," When you're new to writing ads, it can help to break down other ads and figure out where they went wrong. Find a few bad ads - you'll know they're bad because your first impulse will be to skim right over them - and try to figure out what makes them so ineffective. Is it the headline? The bridge? The tone?


Once you've pinpointed what makes the ad bad, think about how you could make it better. Rewrite the ad to make it more effective.
Take a look at effective ads, too, and try to determine what makes them great.

, When you write your own ad, try to make it sound as natural as you can. Write it as though you're saying it to someone else. People are drawn to natural writing - it speaks to them in a way that overly formal, stilted writing just doesn't.


Don't be too stiff - you want your audience to feel accepted and understood.
Don't be too friendly, either - you could come off sounding fake.

, No matter where your ad is published, you should keep it short and sweet. People don't have time to read an ad that requires more than about 30 seconds of their attention - or less. They're encountering your ad on their way to doing something else, like reading an article or getting off the train or bus they're riding. Your ad should be interesting enough to make a big impression using very few words.


Since your ad will be short, make it very specific. Don't use vague language - get to the point right away.Use short sentences instead of long ones. Longer sentences are difficult to take in in a short period of time.
Play with your copy so that you say what you want to say in as few words as possible. It's not necessary to use complete sentences, as long as your message gets across clearly.

, These days, people want to read reviews and testimonials before buying a product. They aren't usually content to try it out until they're reasonably sure that it has worked for other people. Incorporating a testimonial or two into your ad could be a great way to build trust with your audience right off the bat.


Choose a quote from a well-respected customer, if possible. For example, if you're selling a health product, use a quote from a doctor or another health professional.
If you're short on space, you can always put testimonials on your website instead of using them in your ad.

, If you have the opportunity to use an image or video in your advertisement, think carefully about your ad's composition. Having an image will allow you to use fewer words - you won't necessarily need to describe your product's features or state what it does. Instead, Juxtapose the picture or video with an intriguing headline or tagline and your company's URL.


The image or video you choose is just as important as the copy you write - if not more important. Choose graphics that compel your readers on an emotional level and make them desire your product.

, Once you have your ad written, record yourself reading it or saying it to someone. Play it back to yourself. Does it sound conversational? Is it compelling? If someone said it to you, would your interest be piqued? Reading it out loud is a good way to spot deficiencies that could cause your ad to fall flat.

, Go ahead and publish it in a few places to see what kind of reception it gets. Hopefully, you'll see your sales start to increase. You can determine whether new business is a direct result of your ad by asking customers how they heard about your company. If they reference your ad, you know it's working!, Don't keep publishing an ad that isn't increasing your sales. Keep rewriting it until you're confident it's actually bring in more business. A poorly-written ad that doesn't represent your company well can actually do more harm than good. After you've used your ad for a few months, keep things fresh by rewriting it to advertise a new product or feature.

Decide what kind of content you want to create.,
Follow the advice of the ‘Super 7’.,
Boost Search Engine Optimization (SEO).,
Create a two-way conversation.",How to Use a Blog for Business2," Your content needs to be targeted toward a specific audience, with a specific goal in mind. Otherwise it will end up being wishy-washy and all over the place. If you aren’t even sure what you are writing about on your blog, how are you going to attract visitors? Take a while to plan this step.


For example, if you are writing a blog about health food for families, you'll want to make sure that your content remains targeted. Don't start writing about health food for pro wrestlers - stick to the people you plan on marketing your blog to.
Think about how much content you want on the blog per week, if you want varying types of material, and how this will all be produced. Having a blog is no longer good enough; the content needs to be superior too.
Try answering common questions on your blog or teach your readers something. Above all, write for your customers rather than yourself.

, This can be a good way to start if you’re not sure what to write about in your blog. Basically the ‘Super 7’ is a list of seven ways to use your blog that would be well suited to helping your business. You’ll want to write as an expert, answer questions, talk about potential job openings, share new projects and any story that puts your company in a good light, and of course promote your products. If you ensure that you do all or most of these things on your blog the odds are it will succeed.

, SEO is a system in which search engines organize the websites that show up in particular searches. You want yours to be at the top of the list, and to do that you’ll have to engage in search engine optimization. That means adding strong keywords throughout your blog post to make it more relevant to search engines.


Research popular keywords in whatever industry you are a part of to help. Google Insights is a good resource if you are feeling lost. You also should submit your blog to popular search engines by visiting their search console. Submit to popular internet search sites like Google, Yahoo, and Bing .

, Encourage interaction and feedback between your company and customers. Try to do the same with peers, potential customers, or really anyone who you can get to interact with your blog. The more popular it becomes and the more discourse that appears through the site, the more success your blog will have. It’s all about traffic!

"
"
Start sending email blasts, sharing your blog on Facebook and other forms of social media, and asking your friends to do the same.,
Try to get indexed by Google or Yahoo.,
Integrate your blog with social media.",How to Use a Blog for Business3," You'll want to boost your readership in whatever way you possibly can and the first and easiest way to do this is to show your blog to people that you know. If your friends are willing to share the blog on their Facebook page, that's even better. Take advantage of whatever way you can get people to view your blog.


The more people who visit your website starts adding up into the more that visit your business linked to that site. You can call friends, email them, share on their Facebook, whatever it takes to get in touch with them.
Start with people you know and then grow your network from there. If you send your blog to fifty people and five people share it with all their friends, suddenly you’ll find that you will get many more views.

, Appearing in search results is of massive importance to bring traffic to your site. Submitting your blog to popular search engines is one way to do this, as is boosting SEO which involves the use of strategic keywords. You also can look into paying for Google Ad Words, which will help your blog appear in a certain location on the search page if you are willing to spend the money. If you sign up for Google Ad Words you also get a free campaign manager for 90 days to help you market your blog.

, This means making a Twitter and Facebook account for your blog. You can send all your posts to these accounts and also share other interesting posts from related topics on your page. This could start a positive cycle where you share something that someone else has written, and then they share something that you have written, and so on.


Using the health food example, you could post interesting articles that you find about new health food research, or potential grocery shopping lists, or anything else you think of.

Try finding an ad hoster.,
Create a call to action.,
Offer paid membership programs.,
Search for potential partnerships.",How to Use a Blog for Business4," Create ads for your site. An ad is a banner on the top or side of your side that markets a specific product. If you can find ads that are relevant to your business that will make it much less shocking for readers to see these ads. Normally you will need to have developed a decent amount of traffic before you can find advertisement companies that are willing to pay to feature their ads on your blog.


Once you have built up a solid following you can try to convince advertisement agencies to promote their product on your page by approaching them directly. You can also use Google Adsense, which places targeted ads that Google generates based on search history. You will get paid for this too. You’ll earn money every time someone clicks the ad links on your site. , Use your blog to convince your customer to do something with a call to action. Maybe that’s sharing your blog, or to register, or to buy something, or sign up for a premium membership. Whatever your call to action is, make sure you are offering enough content for it to feel worth it to them. You need to give readers a lot before you ask for anything in return. , Once your blog has grown in popularity, you can start offering paid membership programs for premium content or special perks. Be careful not to turn people off by adding a membership program.


The best way to do it is to keep all the existing you content you have available for free, and then when you reveal the membership plan you can roll out a ton of exciting new content only available for members. That way you don’t risk pulling the rug out from under loyal readers who don’t want to pay money, while at the same time enticing your readers to pay a small fee to see all the new content.

, Partnerships can help boost the popularity of your blog, although you won't exactly be making money off of it.


For example, if your blog is about health food for families you might partner with a health food store. You can help promote their services and they can help promote yours. Giving away products that the store gives you for free is one way to do this.

Read or Listen to the sales pitch.,
Don't just hear -Listen.,
Look and Listen for adjectives that embellish the actual description.,
Look and Listen for words such as sharp, strong, durable that actually describe the item being pitched.,
Watch for buzz-words and phrases such as professionally acclaimed, world renowned, guaranteed for life, fabulous, often copied, never duplicated, one of a kind technology, satin finished steel, finest balanced style and never needs maintenance while describing whatever it is that is being pitched.,
Look for the price.",How to View an Advertisement Effectively," Take a moment to experience how it makes you feel. Is your heart racing? Does the Pitchman have your attention? Are you on the edge of your seat? That's the distraction.;
, Don't just see -Read. Look and listen for the words the Pitchman is using. When you are reading an advertisement, let your peripheral vision ride over the pictures. You'd be surprised how many subliminal pictures there are.

, In Latin phraseology the construction of the description of a round, red, ball would be ball round red. English is not so easy. Try to rearrange the adjectives in your mind. What is the primary adjective? Item: Ball. What is the second? Shape: Round. What is the tertiary (Third, fourth, etc.)? Color: Red.

, They normally belong there, and would describe the item in normal conversation. Advertising is not ""normal conversation.""

, Ask yourself if the adjectives are appropriate to normal conversation. Especially when watching commercials or videos. Is the comparison realistic? Is it appropriate? Eliminate the adjectives. How does it sound? Is it still captivating and reasonable?

, Is the price realistic to the item? Is it appropriate to the pitch? There's a big difference. Is the Pitchman trying to convince you that you can't live without the newest Widget at the low, low price of $99.95? Is he offering it for $59.95, and then proceeds to knock off one payment? Does he double the deal, and then add bonus items again and again? Can he really sell a $99.95 item for half price, while throwing all those items in free?

Determine what your keywords are, both for the post you’re writing and your blog overall.,
Write a strong SEO title for your blog post.,
Put as many keywords in your first paragraph as makes sense.,
Continue writing the body of the post.,
Finish with a strong SEO paragraph.,
Include other SEO blog tactics before publishing your post.",How to Write a Blog for SEO," For example, if you manage a blog about traveling to Italy, you will probably have a regular list of keywords that you use in each post. But for a post specifically about day trips from Rome, you’ll want to use a second set of keywords that are unique to that subject.


Websites like Google Insights can help you figure out which keywords are the most popular for your blog post topic.;
, The title should match as closely as possible to the exact search terms people use when looking for information. It should be succinct, clear and helpful.


Good: Rome Day Trips
Bad: Some Places You Can Go That Are Close To Rome

, This helps the spiders further determine how relevant your site is. This article is actually a good example of this step; while it mentions Rome day trips, the title and the first paragraph tell the algorithm to categorize it under SEO tips and not under Italian travel.

, Write as you normally would, making sure to include keywords and phrases where they make the most sense.

, Again, this tells the spiders that the post is still relevant, and has not veered off course into another subject. You want to reiterate the point of the post, and use plenty of your relevant keywords.

, These are some other things you can do to optimize your blog post:


Tag your post with the relevant keywords. Up to about 5 tags are best; use exact keyword phrasing for best results.
Use the “alt tag” on photos that include your keywords. This is the little message that appears when you hover your mouse over a photo. Some people like to include funny messages, but it’s a great opportunity for more keywords. You can do this at the point in which you upload photos.
Link to other sites, and previous posts on your own site, where relevant. One of the things search engines look for when determining relevancy is how many sites link to yours, and how many you link to.

, People see hundreds of ads each day.


Make your advertising copy stand out with a headline that captures their attention.
Headlines should be brief, memorable and noticeable.

, While all types of markets need attention-getting ad copy, the focus will alter with the medium that you use.


Television needs a strong visual appeal. What's going to catch the eye of the consumer? What can you show the audience?
A visual focus is lost on radio listeners. Listen to how your ad sounds. Will it catch the attention of radio listeners?
With Internet advertising, the emphasis is getting a click. If someone is browsing and you've interested them enough to click on your ad, you've succeeded in gaining their attention.

,


Ad writing is a process that begins with a copywriter putting a message on paper or a computer screen.

, Write advertising copy that shows that your product or service offers something the competition doesn't.

Cheaper prices? Convenience? Fun?

Make the phone number, Internet address or physical address easy to find.

, That's right, let the words sit and walk away for a little while.


When you return to your copywriting, look at it with a fresh eye.

,


Rewrite it with fewer words, known as cutting out the dead wood.
No one is going to take the time to read a paragraph in an ad, so make it brief, but with strong and descriptive words.
Forget grammatically correct sentences; it's okay to use fragments as long as the message is catchy and clear.

Manage your budget carefully, as large mail campaigns can have a high cost and negatively impact your return on investment.,
Value-added postcards can help mail get attention.,

, What was it about these offers that compelled you to take the next step?

, Alternative formats can help you qualify for lower postage rates. One great avenue for lowering costs and increasing response rates is to experiment with alternative direct mail formats. Learn more at usps.com.

, Dedicating specific URLs to special offers is a great way to track activity.

, Too often direct marketers create a compelling piece or a great offer but make it difficult for prospects to answer. Overcome this issue by providing prospects with multiple ordering methods. These can include a secure Web site, a toll-free number, or a faxable order form. Consider the pros and cons of various ordering methods, keeping the consumer in mind.

Thinking in terms of “seasons” will help you expand your positive and negative keyword lists in many ways, since people cook different things, wear different clothes, buy different products, seek different services, and consider major purchases in varying seasonal patterns.

, Don’t add negative keywords to your account without carefully considering each one. After all, if your negative keywords are too general, you might miss out on some valid Web traffic. For example, just because someone types in “cheap” doesn’t mean that person wouldn’t buy something expensive.

Create room in the budget to try article directory marketing.,
Search online for article directories.,
Start small, by choosing your favorite article directory and registering an account with them.",How to Use Article Directories for Internet Marketing1," Although it should be tested before adopting it on a grand scale, it will take money to finance SEO writers and/or the hours spent by your marketing team editing, posting and tracking the Return on Investment (ROI). Start by making sure your marketing department has already done research into the keywords most commonly associated with your company and website.;
, Make a list of directories that accept free, well-written articles. Ensure that each directory on your list has an author, or resource, box that allows you to write your job title, company, website and perhaps a short biography about your expertise.


Go to vretoolbar.com/articles/directories to get a list of 50 major article directories. You can also do a simple Internet search for ""article directories"" and spend some time surfing for sites that you think look credible, informative and attractive. However, remember that if they don't support links back to your site, they aren't worth your time.

, You can expand after you have mastered the process.

"
"
Create well-written articles that are between 250 and 600 words.,
Have someone from the marketing department proof all of your articles.",How to Use Article Directories for Internet Marketing2," Different article directories have word count minimums or limits. Commission articles in 1 of the following ways:


Assign articles to yourself or high-ranking people at your company. Keep in mind that every article should be original, but based on research or experience in the industry. A title like CEO, CFO, or Executive Director looks great in the author box on an article directory site.
Contract with SEO writers to write your articles for you. You may have talented SEO writers in your marketing department, or you may need to outsource. Experienced SEO writers understand the quality writing and they can use keywords that refer to your company's services in a way that will help the article to rank highly on a search engine.
Get an expert from the field to write an article. For example, if you are trying to promote a gym, ask your advanced yoga instructor to write an article about using yoga for stress relief. The yoga instructor will add to a portfolio, because they will be published online, but the company link will also appear, so the company will benefit.

, Nothing should go online without some strict editing and proofing. Make sure the editor takes note of the following guidelines for article directory writing:


Create a short, but catchy title. This will appear on search engines and draw readers in. For example, instead of writing ""How to create a yoga routine that relieves daily stress,"" you might write ""A Stress Relief Yoga Guide.""
Make sure the article does not directly sell your products or services. Article directories are valuable because they identify you as a credible company and link to your website. All mentioning of products should be indirect. For example, it is a great idea to explain the value of using a service, but you don't want to name your particular brand.
Use keywords that are associated with your site near the start of the article. The first few sentences help to set up search engine ranking, so make sure at least a portion of the keywords that people use to find your website, are included at the beginning.
Use bullet points, small paragraphs, subheadings and pictures. This improves the readability of the article; however, it is often regulated by the article directory itself, so be sure to consider this when you do your directory research.

"
"
Submit your articles to the directory.,
Make sure your website is set up to track web traffic that originates from the article directory's site.,
Post different articles on 2 or 3 more article directories.,
Share your best articles on social media sites, like Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.,
Ask your marketing department to research any increase in web traffic provided by article directories.",How to Use Article Directories for Internet Marketing3," Do it 1 or 2 articles at a time. Keep in mind that most article directory services have the right to refuse, edit or not approve your article.


The best article directory strategy is to make SEO articles part of your Internet marketing funnel; that way you are constantly submitting them in an effort to expand your reach. This can also help you to improve the quality of the articles over time.

, Many business web hosting companies already include this in their analytic and report software; however, you can also start a free account with Google Analytics and embed a special website tracking link, if it is allowed by the article directory. Keeping track of new website traffic will allow you to keep track of your ROI.

, In some cases, articles can be reworked, using similar information to inform people about a new topic. Track the web traffic created by these websites.

, Accounts usually benefit from providing educational content, and it will help extend the article's reach. If it gets shared or Re-Tweeted, then new clients are likely to arrive at your site.

, Do this after 1 month and after 3 months. Analyze the ROI of this Internet marketing investment, and decide if it is high enough to continue.


If the ROI is low, then discontinue posting new articles. Article directory marketing does not work for every type of business.
If the ROI is high, then ask more employees to get involved with article writing, and begin registering and posting with new article directories. You will find that some of them produce better results than others.

, Post links to news stories, announce people who will be featured, or start discussion threads. You ideally want to create a community around the event that encourages people to engage, post on your wall and invite other friends.

, Click on the ""Edit Page"" button in the upper right hand corner. Click on the tab that says ""Manage Admins"" in the left hand column.

Learn how to research keywords for your campaigns effectively.,
Remove the links from your advertisements that lead to irrelevant landing pages.,
Use advertising analytics programs to help you better assess your campaigns.",How to Succeed in Online Advertising," If you think you can just generate a batch of keywords for your online advertising campaign, and create something successful and financial lucrative for your business, you are very, very wrong. Keyword research, selection and optimization is an incredibly important part of ANY kind of online advertising campaign. Keywords are the route via which potential clients/customers find you and your website. If the keywords are wrong in any way, your online advertising campaign is going to suffer severely. Indeed, it may never take off


You need to think like your target audience when selecting keywords. You also need to use online advertising tools to help you find the keywords that your competitors are using (or not using)
You can then use this information to your advantage;
, If your advertisement states that you are offering a product for 20% off, then that product must be found on your website at a discounted price of 20%. If not, that is false advertising.The advertising networks will not look favorably upon any advertisement which doesn’t lead to what has been advertised and neither will the internet users. Your online advertising campaign will fail and it will fail fast.Make sure that the 20% discounted product promoted in the advertisement is clearly visible on the landing page as soon as the internet user arrives to your site. If the customer/client has to scroll down to find the product, you will probably lose them to one of your competitors. Remember...


Internet users are lazy. They want things to be easy and fast. If you make them work to find your product/service, they’ll just go somewhere else, where the whole experience is easier. Your online advertising campaign will fail if your links to landing pages do not deliver what they promise

, Do you know what you CTR rate is?


Do you know how many conversions you achieved last month?
Do you know which keywords are generating lots of custom for your business. Do you know which ones are just sapping you of your online advertising budget in record time? If you don’t know these things, it is because you are not using an online advertising analytics program, such as Google Analytics for Google AdWords. You are risking failure at online advertising without using an analytics program because you are not investing the right amount of time needed in analysis and research. You cannot just “do” online advertising, you must “revise” and “find ways of improving.”This is how online advertising campaigns grow. This is the way to avoid online advertising failure.

Become familiar with other Abbreviations.,
Consider context.",How to Read Personal Ads," The first letter in a three-letter acronym (TLA) commonly describes either the (a) current relationship or (b) gender identity/sexual preference(s) of the writer. With this in mind, you can interpret the letter within one of those contexts:

F: Female
G: Gay

If your company is looking for new employees, write a short article and post it on LinkedIn. Social media is how most people find things on the the internet these days, so you need to be active.


Post to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram at least once a day.

Use sub-Reddits, which are topic specific forums, to dial into the right markets. There are thousands, so even your page on ""Tractor Maintenance"" will find traction on the sub-Reddit /r/tractors.
Learn how to use hashtags and links to be effective on social media.;
, Your headlines need to attract readers from across the internet. Luckily, there are some trends that have proven to be extra-clickable. As you promote your page, use words like this for extra success:


Top Ten Lists
""....Before you die.""
Modifiers like ""awesome,"" ""cool,"" ""unbelievable,"" etc.
""You'll never believe..."", Get yourself swept up in rising trends by staying topical. It does not have to be much -- a small post commenting on a recent movie, a picture celebrating a winning sports team, or a tweet about the most recent scandal will tap into

, Getting a viewer on your site is tough. But getting them to stay is even tougher. You want to make sure there are a few other links they might click on. Try linking words in your page to other parts of you website, or place a ""Suggested Reading"" section on the side of the page so that people want to keep exploring your site. This promotes return readers, which will boost traffic.

, Paid methods include Facebook and Google advertisements. You pay a company to show your website on relevant pages, where you become one of the top links. Think of the small, yellow links on the top of every Google search — those are paid ads. Paying for ads can be a great way to get started.

, The more people go to you website, the easier it will be to get other viewers. This means, however, that the first few months are the hardest. Be patient and keep plugging away on your site and social media and viewers will come.

, Search Engine Optimization, or SEO, is the art of getting your page on the top of someone's Google search. Proper SEO is not an exact science, but it is what separates the most viewed websites from those on page 8. Search engines look at four basic categories when deciding where you rank:



Content: Search engines like Google look at the text, titles, and themes of your site. If you have 5-10 pages with the words ""tractor repair skills,"" for example, you are more likely to appear when someone searches for ""tractor repair.""

Performance: How fast does your site load? Lots of videos, pictures, and graphics will slow down your site and cause it to plummet.

Authority: This is judged by how often someone else links to you. If other sites think your content is worth citing, search engines will rank you higher.

User Experience: This is measured by how long people stay on your page. Inviting, informative, and exciting pages will have a higher UE score and rank higher on search engines., There are millions of pages about Hollywood fashion trends. There are not millions of pages talking about how to find and design the fabrics needed for action movie costumes. The more specific your page, the more it stands out, and the easier it is to promote. You will never challenge CNN.com for their viewers on the news, but you might be able to write first-person stories exploring the news from a civilian's perspective.


Think in terms of search engines. You won't compete with ""The News,"" but you might compete with ""Bay Area Local Politics.""

, What are the words that really sum up your pages? What is the main drive of your site? The more you can naturally interweave these terms, the higher you will appear on sites like Google and Yahoo. For example, you might have a page about Croatian Cooking. To get the most out of search engines, you should:


Put the words ""Croatian cooking"" in your site title.Use the words ""Croatian cooking"" in every article at least once.
Have the words ""Croatian"" and/or ""Cooking"" in the site URL.(www.cookingwithThomas.com/Cooking-Croation-Pies)

, These sites will tell you where your traffic is coming from, as well as which search terms people are using to find you. This information can be incredibly helpful in promoting your site. If, for example, you see that most of your traffic comes from people searching ""Cute Beagle Pictures,"" you might start tailoring your promotion to Twitter accounts and dog-lover forums.

, If you wrote a semi-relevant article two months ago, link it to your new one! This drives up traffic on the site and tells search engines that your site has a lot of good content to search for.

, Image descriptions make it easy for search engines to decipher what is on your page. Try to use your keywords as you describe images so that they shoot up to the top when anyone searches for them., It is impossible to build consistent, high-volume traffic on your webpage without getting people to come back day after day. While you should always be on the hunt for new markets and viewers to tap into, you need to provide longtime readers a reason to keep coming back or your site will fall apart.

, Keep people updated on new information, and keep them engaged constantly. Soon they'll be sharing your site with others and you'll get more views, likes, shares, etc. You want your site to be a dependable source of information—the first place people turn when they open up their computers—no matter what your subject or topic.

, Everyone loves a contest, poll, or giveaway. Get people involved by asking for their opinions in the comments section or raffling off a website-themed prize. If you can get your community to interact with you, it will draw viewers to the page.

, Let your fans and followers know that you see them. When they leave a reply for you to see, they probably also expect an answer back. So by replying, they'll see that you do care about their comments and that you do see them. They'll admire you for being so kind to them and be a loyal member/fan/follower.


That said, you cannot reply to everyone — be prudent and respond to viewers who seem interested in conversations. These will draw other people in and give your page more content.

Find the right keywords.,
Apply the keywords to your website.,
Create a blog.,
Advertise.",How to Promote Your Single Page Website," The first thing you should do is find the right keywords and keyword phrases to promote your website. You should think in terms of what you have to offer on your webpage. What words would a user apply to a search engine to find the type of content you provide?
There are various free online tools to help you find the right keywords including Google’s AdWords Keyword Tool. These tools will show you just how popular your keyword is and how effective it can be. They will also tell you the level of competition for relevant keywords.;
, When you have identified the most relevant keywords that you would like to use for promoting your website, apply the keywords to the site. Keywords should be included in meta and title tags as well as page content. It is important to avoid repeating the keywords too many times. Search engine categorize this as overstuffing a webpage.

, Because you are promoting a single page website, you will not have as many opportunities to upload fresh content as a multipage website. However, fresh content that is engaging and informative is still vital for promoting your brand online.
Creating a blog will allow you to meet your website’s objectives without having to create multiple pages on the site. You can easily increase traffic to your one page website by simply creating a blog where you can upload fresh content regularly.
Be sure to optimize the content you post on your blog with the relevant keywords you selected in the first step. Ensure that the content you post is informative and engaging to readers.

, Advertising is still an effective way to promote a website. Google AdWords has become especially popular as a means for advertising online. It allows you to advertise your website on search engine results pages that are related to keywords that you’ve selected. You are therefore able to draw users who are already interested in what you have to offer. This is therefore a great option for driving up sales and conversions.
It is important to search for as many opportunities as possible to promote your website. Be aggressive to make your efforts count.

Make good use of social bookmarking sites.",How to Start Link Building for Your Website," Link-building is the process of creating links back to your site. This happens naturally with good content, but can also be helped along through a variety of methods. Back-links are important because they affect the rank that your site receives and where it appears in search results. Multiple factors are taken into account, including:


Trust - This is the level of trust between sites that are linked. Links on trustworthy sites will weigh much heavier.
Link Neighborhood - This is the general level of the sites that link to you and you link to. For example, a spammy site will often link to other spammy sites, making the link neighborhood lower.
Anchor text - This is the text that is displayed in place of the link address. The anchor text should be relevant to the content that is being linked to, as search engines compare this text with the destination it links to.
Freshness - Since pages become less popular over time, link relevancy tends to decay. Fresh links are a sign that the content being linked to is still relevant, and helps boost rankings.;
, Both usually have a place where you can add your website's link to your profile that you create, and to your profile's signature. Each time you post a comment in a forum your signature will be left with that comment for all to see, including search engines.


In order to build a good network of links, you'll want to find sites that fit into your genre. Competition is not something that should be ignored or avoided. Instead, work with the other sites in your field and you will quickly find yourself growing.

, Article submission is a little more time consuming for link building techniques, but can also help increase your website's page rank if posted on the right sites. Start by writing several small articles concerning topics that have to do with the content on your website. You then submit these articles to websites that will post them for their viewers. Be sure to always add your website link in the source section of your article. That way web crawlers sent by search engine will find the link when crawling the site.


This method might not be as effective as it once was, due to Google's ""panda"" algorithm update., RSS or ""Really Simple Syndication"", is a family of web feed formats used to publish frequently updated works, such as websites, blogs, and headline news, into a standardized format. RSS documents are called feeds which include text and metadata that are published when your website or blog is updated. This is a huge benefit because RSS feed submissions allow webmasters to publish their websites or blogs content automatically. The more websites you submit your RSS feed to, the more times your new content is published for search engines to find. Like most link building techniques there are many websites out there you can submit your site or blogs RSS feed to.

, Question answering can be a very productive link building technique but can also be very time consuming. There are many websites people can go to to post questions and wait for other people to post the answers. This can be very productive because most of these sites allow you to also post a source link with the answer to the question. This will allow web crawlers to find your links as well as allow other people searching for the same answer to follow the link back to your website.


Putting your link on types of websites that allow you to answer questions may also greatly increase your site's rank due to these site having a higher rank themselves.Be careful not to spend your whole day answering questions. This technique is best used by just answering a handful of questions each week. Over time the backlinks will start to build up.

, Blogging is another link building technique that can help your website greatly, but can also be time consuming. If done right a blog can not only help build backlinks to your website but also help credit your site, attract new visitors to your site, and promote new pages and information on your site. Remember to always add a link to the blog post so web crawlers and visitors can follow the link back to your website.

, Directories of sites is one of the oldest and most common forms of building links. Directories are large collections of links that share genres or subjects. These directories can then be perused by readers and web crawlers.


Popular directories include: Open Directory Project, Yahoo! directory, and others. There are also directories that are specific to your niche, so do some research and submit your site.
Most directories require you to manually submit your site, and many are edited by volunteers. This means there can be a significant delay when waiting for your submission to be posted.
Submitting your site can be a time-consuming process, and is often outsourced to save time and money.

, If you have a site that would complement another site, contact the webmaster and inquire about trading links. Links from and to related content will increase the trust value of both sites, and can be mutually beneficial.


For example, if you have a website about jewelry cleaning tips, contact jewelry shops and jewelry trading sites., A quick way to spread your links is to comment on other blogs and articles that are related to your content. There are a few different camps when it comes to the best way to go about doing this. Some suggest placing contextual links to your site within your response, while other's suggest placing it in your signature or profile.


Place your links in natural locations. Links surrounded with context are much more likely to be considered a ""good"" link.Avoid putting links in sidebars and footers. They are much less likely to get crawled in these locations.

, Besides trying to build back-links to your pages, you should be linking out to other trusted sites in your field. This will help build your trust and improve your link neighborhood. Webmasters of other sites are bound to notice positive traffic from your links, which could lead to partnerships and link swaps.


As with all of your link-building, make sure you are linking out to relevant content.

, When you are linking to your site in other articles and comments, link to a relevant page or article, and not just to your front page. This will help you raise the rank of pages other than your homepage, which will help your overall presence.

, Many sites and blogs feature regular guest writers. Have a few samples prepared, and contact the webmaster about a guest writing spot. Your guest post is a good place to put a few choice links to your site, as well as include a link in your signature.


Make sure that your links are relevant.
Don't use too many links, or your post will come across as spammy.
Some webmasters may frown on too much self-promotion, so make sure the content of your guest post is still good and worth reading.

, Make sure that all of your articles are being broadcast through your RSS feed, and that the feed has been submitted to relevant RSS directories. This will lead to a lot more traffic coming in to your articles, which will lead to more natural back-links.

, The number one way to get natural back-links is to create useful content. People will do your linking work for you if your content is useful or interesting to them. Creating good content is an art form, and will come with practice.


Use alternative content delivery methods. Try using comics, podcasts, videos, or any other form of communication to help set yourself apart and build a good brand identity.

Interviews are a great way to create interesting content as well as network. Interviews are factual and generally bring lots of views from interested demographics.

, If you are an expert on a subject, leverage that expertise and make yourself an authority on that subject. If you are providing useful and unique content for your niche, you will find others linking to you as a reference. These are some of the strongest links you can make, as they greatly affect your trust rating.


If you are able to make yourself enough of an authority, you can find yourself linked in news articles and other major publications. These can lead to massive increases in traffic and rank.

, The internet buzz is constantly shifting, and it pays to stay on top of what's popular. Tailor your content to meet the shifting tides of what is being talked about, and you will find yourself being linked all over the place.

, Nobody likes reading an article that is poorly written or riddled with spelling errors. Take some time and proofread your writing. A lot of this polish will come with practice and patience.

, Evergreen content is content that will always be relevant. This content is good for consistent links, as the content often gets rediscovered at a later date. A strong link portfolio will have several evergreen links mixed in. Some of the best evergreen content include romance, food, parenting, weight loss, pet care, and much more. Common evergreen formats include:Lists
Reviews
How-tos

, An ugly or unusable site will kill your back-link campaign before it even starts. A visually appealing site has never been more important, and readers will quickly ignore sites that are difficult to use or difficult to read.

, Use as many different social networks as makes sense for your site. Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Tumblr, and more are all potential link-sharing treasure troves. Make sure that you have a presence on as many of these sites as you can manage with your time and budget. Building a simple social page usually only takes minutes and can benefit greatly because it allows you to add loads of information and links that help credit your website and at the same time attract new visitors. Millions of people each day search these social websites to find new information, and then share that information with friends and family.

, Make sure that all of your social media viewers can reach your newest content. This will keep them coming to your site, and potentially back-linking to your articles.

, Social bookmarking is a method for Internet users to organize, store, manage, search and share online resources, such as websites. Digg, Reddit, Pinterest, Stumbleupon, and other sites are a great way to your articles in front of new viewers. Many of these sites let you submit your own article, though they may have limits on how often you can do it. Ideally, your readers will be submitting this site to these social bookmarks for you, building your popularity and trust.


Many blog platforms have plugins you can use to allow your readers to easily submit your articles to social bookmarking sites.

Focus on the individual goals and objectives that are trying to be accomplished and use these as a means of providing the most sufficient results. Meaning – if you have a site that specializes in sales of sports memorabilia, your content should be relevant and revolve around information pertinent to sports memorabilia, not some off topic content such as baseball records. Search engines look at domain names, title tags, and header tags to assist them in ranking the website according to relevance. It is important to maintain consistency in text with the subject of your site.
, By knowing your competition in the industry, you will gain a better understanding of what exactly needs to be accomplished. It is helpful to find the top 5-10 competitors in your industry and find out what methods they are employing (they are at the top of the search engines aren’t they?). This process also helps with generating valuable keywords for your website. If you have a site promoting “cheap football tickets” it might be a good idea to go after “discount football tickets” versus “cheap football tickets”. Not only will the keywords be more geared towards your site's intentions, but they will also bring in more relevant traffic to the site if ranked high enough in the search engines. Relevant traffic = Return on Investment (ROI)., HTML's meta tag does not alter the content visible on the website; they exist only for search engines and other bots. Place a title tag at the top of each page to identify the document's overall content. Write an accurate meta description tag, since it is often used by search engines to describe a site in search results. Add a meta keyword tag as well to reveal the most important keywords for each page to search engine bots.


Note that Google's search bots do not look at meta keywords, but other search engines may. Meta tags, however, are not the end all solution to search engine optimization. They are critical in helping the spiders index the pages – that is, for the search engines that still support them, but will still not skyrocket your rankings to the top of the search engines. Make sure your keywords are relevant to what is on the page. If there is no mention of “Golf Clubs” on that page, it makes no sense to include those words in your website. Keep the description tag brief and to the point. Avoid non-indexable words such as where, too, and etc. Incorporating some keywords in the description is often helpful as long as it makes sense. The more descriptive the tag is towards the content, the better your site will fare in the rankings.

, Identify keywords related to your site's content. These can be popular search terms that lead people to your site, words related to your overall topic, and the topic of a specific page or blog post. If you're not sure which keywords are popular search terms, there are services online that can help you evaluate keywords, many of them with free trials. Try KeywordSpy or WordTracker.


Create a spreadsheet and start listing as many words as possible relating to your website. Focus on every little product, every subject that encompasses the concept of the website. It is not uncommon for your list to reach close to or over 1000 keywords here. Once you are finished, sort the list by alphabetizing and removing the duplicate words. Then single out the words that are the most descriptive of your site. You will now need to find and use a word tracker program to help analyze the keywords and determine how many times those words are searched for in a day (there are many tools freely available via Google). This process will help you find the most popular keywords that are relevant to the content of your site.

, Having keyword-rich content is the key to performing well with search engines. Some search engine bots may penalize you for keyword spamming, however, so learn where to focus your efforts:


Use the keywords liberally on your home page.
Include keywords in header tags, title tags, and meta tags.
Include keywords in the anchor text used to describe links.
Use keywords in the URL of new pages.

, This makes them searchable by search engine bots, which cannot otherwise detect what is in your images. If you can, include a keyword or two in these descriptions, but keep the description accurate.

, These reports are used to determine the current traffic to your website to see what kind of activity is taking place, where your traffic is coming from, and what pages are the most popular on your website as well as how they currently rank. If you are not already monitoring your web traffic you will want to do this for at least a month to get a feel for your current volume. Statcounter is good for monitoring.This step is crucial in the SEO process because these reports will also be used to gauge previous activity to your optimized performance., It should include several variations of web pages, and may also require the modification of some of the content and code. You will want to create a site map, and incorporate a search engine as well as adding a forum or a blog, a resources page, etc. All of this plays an important role in Search Engine Optimization and assists in satisfying the likes of the popular search engines., Good Web content is a critical factor in keeping site visitors interested and coming back for more. This in turn will lead to higher search engine rankings. When writing new content, keep in mind that each page should have at least 250 words.

, Building good incoming or back links can also increase your search engine ranking and website traffic. List your website in relevant directories and forums, and ask websites on similar topics to link to content on your website. Most major search engines rank web pages based partially on the number and the quality of links that point to the site.

, Site maps are XML files that list every URL in your website. Your web host may provide this file, or you may have to make it yourself. Find an example site map file and replace the example URLs with URLs of pages on your website. Once every page is listed, upload it to the root folder of your web server. Submit the link to this site map to Google and other major search engines.


Search online for ""submit a sitemap"" to find sites where you can submit your link.
You may also hire a service to make a sitemap for you.

, Frames, which are being used less and less, enable you to split a page into pieces and section off static content to decrease download times. However, using frames can prevent search engine bots from accessing your entire website.


Providing a site map may mitigate this problem.

, While search engines don't care whether your HTML code is error-free, they rely on the basic correctness of the code to find out which portions of your web page to index. If your HTML code contains errors, it is possible that only portions of your web page are included in the search engine's database. Use W3C or another site to validate your HTML, checking it for errors.

, One of the most common misconceptions to search engine optimization is that if you swap links your site will gain in popularity. Relevant traffic is what is important here and linking to any old Tom, Dick or Harry will flat out hurt rankings before anything else. Search Engine Algorithms are focused on relevance. What you want to do is cross-link with a site that offers similar content or related material, which will benefit you and the person you are linking with. If your website is about collecting, hobbies, and sports, you do not want to link with someone who collects recipes, or focuses on politics., Paid inclusion and Cost Per Click are options that are also available. There is a good article about paid inclusion as a means of countering the rising cost of CPC prices, which can be read here: Target Marketing Mag, Optimizing a website is not enough to maintain the top spots in search engines for your most important keywords. Algorithms are always changing, and so is the industry. This step is optional but it is highly encouraged you continuously optimize your site., The best way to judge the success of your optimizing efforts is to continuously monitor and analyze your traffic. It will continuously offer clues as to which pages are performing the best, keep you aware of consumer interests, and most of all to see what is and what is not working."

Place an ad on the top fold.,
Choose the right side.,
Try an ad between the text.,
Add rich media.,
Test your ad in different ways.",How to Position Ads on Your Website," Consulting firm Nielsen Norman Group says web users spend 80% of their time looking at information above the middle of page fold. It can be placed on top of the text and will be the first ad the user will see once the page is loaded. The best measurement for an ad in the top fold is 728x90. 728x90 fits perfectly on top of a browser page and is hard to ignore.;
, The top right side of the page is also a smart place to place your ad because this is the side where a user’s eyes typically head first. Plus, it would make sense that you’d place your text on the left page and the ad on the right to continue the text. Place an 300x250 on the top right of your page, it should go along with your content, and again won't be ignored.

, Place at least one ad in between the text, these ads are known to generate high ECPMs. The logic here is that the user won't miss the ad because he is already reading the page.

, Rich media has the perfect name, because it describes the essence of its own format. Rich media maximizes revenue and can improve your site’s overall eCPM. Rich media such as pop ups, pop unders, Stay Ons, Lightbox ads, and Sliders have been proven to generate more revenue. Types of rich media:


Stay Ons: Banners that remain fixed to a visitor’s screen even when they scroll throughout the page. It yields great results but can also be closed with a click.
Lightbox Ads: These banners look like a box of light on top of a darker background, thus it’s the first thing a user sees when entering a website. These ads are known for high conversion rates because of their high visibility.
Sliders: Slider ads slide up from the bottom of the screen. They remain static on the screen even if the user scrolls up and down, which demands attention.

, While there are certain areas on a website that work better than others, it’s important to experiments with the placement of your ads because different positions could mean different outcomes for different types of ads. The key is to try different positioning until you find the one that generates the highest revenue.

Reduce your use of intensive applications.,
Optimize your images.,
Enable GZIP compression on the server.,
Use a Javascript debounce function when necessary.,
Minify CSS and Javascript code.,
Use the latest version of PHP.,
Check your site's caching methods.,
Use a third-party website evaluator and optimizer.",How to Optimize Your Website2," Website that overuse Flash or Java Applet can take much longer to load. Try not to rely on these for your basic web page, and don't make Flash videos play automatically.


Video popups are a big culprit in slow web pages as well, and may irritate your users.

, Large, high quality images can slow down your website considerably, and may burn through your server hosting space as well. Use Photoshop, or a free image editing program such as GIMP, to optimize your photos for the web. In Photoshop, you can simply click File → Save for Web. If editing images manually, you can reduce image resolution to 72 dpi, and set the color space to sRGB., GZIP compresses text files by locating similar strings of text and temporarily replacing them with smaller strings, to make files smaller while sending between the server and the user's computer. Follow these instructions to enable GZIP.

, If you are using Javascript, frequent repetition of the same request can slow down a browser's performance considerably. Add a debounce function to prevent another function from firing more frequently than you specify. Limiting a function to firing once every 250 milliseconds is a good starting point., Minification removes all unnecessary characters from code, typically white space, new lines, and comments. Use Closure Compiler to minify Javascript for free, or find an optimizer for the type of code you are working with.


You will still be able to edit your code with the human-readable organization. The code is minified only when it is uploaded to the server.

, Make sure you are using the latest version of PHP, so you can benefit from the latest improvements. While the PHP developers try to keep the language backwards-compatible, you will probably need to spend some time updating your code in accordance with the latest changes.

, If your web page caches files locally, your server won't receive a new request every time that user visits your site again. If you have a high traffic website, caching can be a significant improvement. Search online for a web page cache test to find out whether your site is caching images and files, and research ways to improve your caching method.

, Third-party programs such as Google PageSpeed or Yahoo YSlow analyze your web page and attempt to find areas that could be improved. Some may automatically optimize parts of your website for you.


If you have a high-traffic website, consider hiring a service that both optimizes and protects you from DDOS attacks.

This basically means you should be creating really quality pieces that are useful and engaging for humans because the search engines will recognise your efforts. Your readers will share your work generating additional backlinks, not to mention extra traffic, and search engines will recognise your quality piece because it will flow naturally with not too many keywords (something which is penalized in the post Penguin Update world).


Write content people want to share on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and other social networks. The search engine will read those social signals as a signal of the quality of your domain. You can accelerate the spread of your content on these sites by having an account on these social networks with lots of followers.
Consider submitting your content to sites like Reddit, Delicious, Digg and other content aggregators that might gain you a few readers.
Go back and SEO rewrite some old content. Chances are you know stuff about search engine optimization that you didn't know last year (not to mention changes in SEO best practices since last year). Re-visit some old content and re-write it with your search engine optimisation hat on, updating image attributes, changing keyword density, adding links to your home page and other relevant content on your site. Even consider republishing as a fresh article for extra brownie points with the search engines!

,


Even if you are new to the web, you have natural links you could try to get. All businesses have suppliers whether they be accountants, solicitors or raw material providers. All these suppliers are bound to have a website, contact them to ask for a link back, but do not offer a link in exchange. Link exchanges don't violate Google's TOS, but they will now work against you. When building links, always give other site owners a reason to want to link back to you. Perhaps write an article based on a particular client - everyone likes bragging rights and this can gain you additional links without even having to ask. All Google wants to see is links that have an editorial right to be there.
Look to make use of co-citations (also known as co-occurrence). This is a way to show Google a link or relationship a website might have, based upon the site being mentioned from multiple sources. Generally co-citations do not have a direct hyperlink to a website.

, Pictures dress up your pages but search engines don't really know how to deal with them unless you complete all the nitty-gritty details like title, caption, alternate text, description. Be ethical though, don't use it as an opportunity to cram an extra few keywords onto the page as this will likely have a negative impact on your search engine ranking. Some people search for what they are looking for via Google image search, if your image is highly visible then your potential customers will likely visit your page.

, There needs to be variations in the text when one creates those blue-highlighted anchor text links. The links on a page are what the search engine spiders follow in determining where they are being led. The text used in the links are used in helping the search engines figure out what the page it leads to is all about.

, Incorporating your branded keywords into your SEO campaign is also important when it comes to link building and anchor text. If you continually use the same non-branded keywords as anchor text links throughout content it appears to the search engines that you are trying to manipulate search results for that term. Instead, you want to keep your anchor text linking natural. A good way to do so is to link to the brand a significant amount of the time, since that’s probably how someone with no SEO knowledge would link back to your website.

, Although it’s been a classic rule that “readers online do not read”, it simply doesn’t mean that one has to deprive the online users of good, meaty content. Stick to at least 250 words a page. SEOs know that writing down for an appropriate length of text means being more able to include more related terms for the target keywords.
In order to help with the page-browsing experience, consider using large fonts to draw the eye to key headline points. This will make for a page that is broken up well into sections that answer the question the reader is looking for.

, The content on your website should be unique from other pages on your site, and from external sites as well. Consider using a tool such as Siteliner to look for duplicate content.

, It’s very important to put keywords in your page title; specifically try to get important keywords first and try to limit the overall length of your page title. Well-constructed title tags contain the main keyword for the page. It should contain less than 65 characters with no stop words such as: a, if, the, then, and, an, to, etc. Your title tag should also be limited to the use of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and commas.;
, H1 is the most significant. Make sure you have the most important keyword labeled as h1 tag. This will help you with ranking for your site, especially if someone is searching for that particular key word or phrase.

, You definitely want to put your keywords in the contents somewhere, but the object, though, is to make sure the content is very well written for visitors to your website. You want to insert the keywords for that page only where it makes sense. Page content should have between 300 and 700 words of descriptive content that contains the keywords specified in the keywords meta tag for the page. You also want to try to optimize your URLs. Make sure to include important keywords in the URL.

, These are pieces of code behind the scene. The code should look something like this: It should be placed directly under the title tag code
<title> Your site title</title>
<meta name=""description"" content=""your site description""
<meta name=""keywords"" content=""keyword1, keyword2, keyword3""
Your keywords meta tag should contain between 5-10 keywords or keyword phrases that are also found in page content. Also one more important meta tag is description tag that contains information about the page's content so you can persuade search engine users to visit your web site. It should have 15-160 characters, remember not to stuff it with keywords.

, Each page of your site should contain links to every other page so search engine spiders can find every page. This is an important step for the proper indexing and page ranking for your site.

, It's important to use two site maps for your website--an XML version and a static version. The XML version can be created by sitemap generators tools such as http://www.xml-sitemaps.com. The sitemap should then be submitted to the Google Webmaster Tools account for that site. This will aid in crawling of Google's Spidebot. The static version should be an HTML page that contains links to every other page. You should also reference your XML sitemap location in your robots.txt file.

Use social media accounts to promote every single post.
Embed links to other articles of yours in each article.
Deliver regular content.

Learn how to utilize SEO., The top priority should be creating content that is worth reading. If you write blog posts that are worth reading people will come back to your blog over and over. You build a following, and when you have something to say there will be people who will read it. Do not write a financial blog one day and a cooking blog the next because you'll never know who your readers are.


Pictures and video are becoming increasingly important online. Make sure you have images to go with your posts to keep readers engaged.
Monetizing a blog is about finding a market of buyers interested in specific products -- finance or cooking -- not the small number of people who like both., This takes some time, but will net you much higher profits. Basically, you just ask a business or individual if they want to buy space on your site, charging by the month to keep it up. You can offer different sized ads for different prices or lengths of time and you get the entire profit, not Google. However, you have to take the time to find a buyer, which leads to less time blogging. You also have to be able to seamlessly incorporate the ad into your site. Be ready to:


Show a potential buyer your monthly page views and visitor counts.
Point out your blog's specific niche and target audience.
Work with them to make sure the ads fit neatly in your site, without compromising content.

, No one likes to click on a website and get inundated with ads. If your readers feel like you're selling them out, or that you care more about money than content, they will leave. So place your ads sparingly, using other methods like direct sales or services to make your money.


In general, ads come in three standard pixel sizes: 300×250, 160×600, or 728×90., This is especially important if you sell or plan to sell anything on your blog. Use a service like MailChimp or Useletter to collect and store mass emails. Wordpress even has a built in ""follower"" section that collects addresses. When your eBook comes out, or you have a fundraiser to start, being able to get the word directly to your reader's inboxes is an invaluable way to advertise your work directly.


Do not spam your readers, however, with mail. One email a month is generally a good start, or whenever you have something new to promote.

, The better you can tap into other sites like yours, the better your chances of attracting viewers. Comment on other blogs, offer to share or write specialty posts, follow your favorite writers on Twitter, and generally make your presence known. Within 2-3 months you'll see the uptick in traffic as your friends recommend you back and start building up your trustworthiness., Because you generally don't have a lot of ""products"" to sell on your blog, you don't usually have a lot of ways to make big bucks starting out. Building a readership, honing your writing skills, and finding your niche are most important. Once you've got this, you can start implementing monetization strategies. However, this should not be your first and only strategy.

Make sure you place the ad correctly.,
Consider linking text.,
Put small, relevant images next to your ads.,
Make the ads relevant.,
Keep to one theme.,
If you're working on a page that's ""deep"" within a website - consider selectively removing some of the distractions so that more people look at the adverts.

,
Do your research.",How to Maximize Ad Revenue on a Website," Ads that people can’t see won’t be clicked on, so make sure the ads are located in a prime spot that will generate interest. The best spots for an ad is on the top fold of the webpage, meaning the viewer can see the ad without having to scroll. But not on the very top, most people don't look there;
, This helps to make the ad stand out more and gives a better chance for the viewer to actually read the ads. Secondly, since the ads are embedded within the text, it’s harder for the viewer to miss. Ads located on the sides are oftentimes looked over, which is exactly what you don't want visitors to do.

, This has been show to increase ad revenue because this attracts attention to the ads, and people are tricked into thinking that the picture is content related to the ad. Google Adsense allows this method (somewhat, however, some images placed next to ads can violate Google TOS, ask Google before adding images next to ads), however Yahoo Publisher Network does not allow it. Read the TOS on certain publishers to get more info on whether this is allowed or not.

, The best part of contextual advertising is that the ads are relevant to your site (AdBrite does not have this feature, they just put up generic network ads). Google and Yahoo both target their ads decently well, but Google Adsense definitely has the best ads that are relevant to your site. To increase ad relativity, make sure the keywords that you want ads for are repeated throughout. For example, if you wanted to display ads related to “making money” you would repeat the phrase making money many times on my page. If you want to be making money, and making money is what you want, then make sure that you are making money by implementing these ads well. It’s also best to spread your keywords throughout the page instead of concentrated in one area like above.

, This kind of ties in with making your ads relevant, but make sure your website concentrates one one certain type of category. For example, GameSpot.com is a site that focuses on games, while IGN.com has sections over games, movies, comics, cars, etc. GameSpot, if they used Google Adsense, would be serving the most relevant ads - gaming ads. While IGN, if they used Google Adsense, would be serving ads about all sorts of things because they have so many sectors. If a gamer goes on IGN and sees an ad about Japanese Movies, they probably won’t be enticed to click. Of course, these statements are just theoretically speaking, the main point is that if your website is focused on one topic, the ads will be better served to your target audience. If you have a website that covers many things, it will be harder to generate ads that interest your users.

,, Each publisher allows you to create separate channels for your ads so you can track how each individual ad unit is doing. Look over your ads and see which ones are performing the best, and then make a judgement as to which ads you should keep and which ones you should alter or get rid of. Constantly looking over your statistics is a key factor to increasing your ad revenue.

These simulators will help reveal any issues with the navigation and structure of your site.

, Twitter allows you to post whenever you release new content. Twitter is one of the most important new tools for keeping readers informed. Post your headline and a shortened URL to the article for each new post on your site.

Establish the goal of your advertising campaign(s).,
Decide what metrics will be used to judge the effectiveness of your ad.,
Establish baselines for traffic, clicks, sales and current campaigns.,
Invest in website tracking software that will work with your chosen metrics.,
Invest in creating landing pages, if you do not already do so.,
Choose to advertise on sites that will give keep track of analytics.",How to Measure the Effectiveness of Web Advertising1," For many sites, this is an increase in sales; however, for websites that sell advertising or contacts, your goal could simply be an increase in traffic or database numbers. Once you decide your goal, you can choose the metrics by which to judge when it is met.;
, Choose 1 of the following metrics that proves an ad has met your ad campaign's goals and devise your tracking method accordingly:


Increase in web traffic. This can be judged simply as the number of people who go to your website daily. If this is how you market to advertisers on your site, then a simple increase in traffic as proved by tracking software, may mean your campaign is a success. A more sophisticated web traffic campaign would judge the number of visitors who sign up with their name, email, age or address. If your goal is to establish a database, then judge your traffic based on new visitors who sign up on landing pages.
Length of visit. If your page's effectiveness is judged by how long a person visits your site, then judge the effectiveness by the number of people who spend 30 minutes or longer on your website. Pay for web tracking software that gathers the amount of time new users spend on a page.
Page views. If you are providing high-quality content, such as downloads or videos to users, you will want to establish how many people download or stream your content. Invest in software that gathers the information on how many people play the entire video and how many close it early.
Clicks. Many online ads are Pay-Per-Click (PPC), and you should gather both the number of clicks and the conversion rate. Choose a PPC ad provider that tracks both clicks and conversion rates. Google AdWords provides this tracking along with your bid on clicks.
Ad views. The number of ad views tells you how many times during a day, week or month that your ad was shown to web page viewers. This number is usually much higher than the number of people that click on your ad. Use this as a metric if you are trying to measure the effectiveness of 1 ad against another. For example, if you have an ad that appears on a search engine with the keyword ""surf gear"" and another for ""surfing gear,"" the number of ad views and the number of clicks will determine which ad is more valuable.

, Gather 2 months to 1 year's worth of data on the visitors that arrive at your site, where they come from and what the conversion rate is. You will use this data to compare against your online campaigns.

, Although most websites have basic traffic tracking, it is important to invest in this if you do not already have it. Look for a program or plugin that can collect and archive data, as well as run reports on campaigns.


Possible software programs include Webalizer, Urchin and WebTrends. Google Analytics provides free campaign tracking with limited functionality. Some advertising programs, such as Google AdWords, include traffic and conversion tracking.

, Landing pages are specially designed pages that are used to collect data from users and they often allow you to sign up users for an account. They are popular with online advertising because they allow you to design a page that will cater to a demographic and keep track of precise increases in web traffic.


Link your web ads to a landing page instead of your general website. They increase your ad's chances of working. They can also help you develop your own database, if you offer high quality content when users create an account. Communicating with your database with email specials and promotions will increase the ROI.

, Some ads, like Rich Media Ads, stream video or animate, so they can get your information to a potential customer, and they don't have to click. In this case, make sure that the website you are buying the ad from can give you the number of people who have seen the video, how many times it was viewed and the average amount of time a user stayed on the ad.

, You can invite your network of friends and contacts in other social media sites like Facebook, Myspace, LinkedIn, etc. to join your own social networking site.

Choose a topic you know a great deal about.,
Front-load the site.,
Emphasize quality over quantity.,
Add to your site routinely.",How to Make Your Website Popular1," Even if it means taking a risk, focus on something that you feel passionate about. In fact, the internet is a great place for niche content precisely because your potential audience is global, not local; this increases your odds of connecting with people who want what you have to offer. Only by making the site specific to you and your experience will you be able to offer something that no one else can.;
, Whether you’re selling merchandise, providing instruction, or blogging for fun, don’t make the mistake of taking your site online before it has a sufficient amount of content. Even if your initial content is stellar, visitors who don’t have any reason to stick around aren’t likely to come back later or recommend your site to their friends.

, One of the disadvantages of the internet is that it is jam-packed with distractions and encourages superficial reading. If your site is nothing but fluff, people will skim it quickly and move on to something else. On top of that, because the internet feels anonymous, people are quick to pounce on inaccuracies, typos, and bugs – which can sink your site and kill your morale. Be sure to pack your site with content people cannot find anywhere else, even if it means you have less of it.

, Though you should have a nice chunk of content available when you first go online, don’t use up everything you’ve got at once or your followers will get tired of waiting and move on. Ideally, you should prepare startup content, have a small reserve of additional content that you release on a schedule (ex. every Thursday), and be ready to routinely create new content once you have gotten into the swing of things.


You should never consider your website “complete”; if you want it to survive, treat it like a ""living"" document that will change over time.
Consider creating a web feed (RSS, Atom, etc.) so users can subscribe for updates.

Keep track of the money spent on investment.,
Assign someone to monitor each web advertising campaign.,
Determine the return on investment.,
Compare your advertising campaigns against each other and against your baseline data.",How to Measure the Effectiveness of Web Advertising2," In order to get a good view of the ROI, you must add up the investment, which is usually the price of the ad, the labor used to create it and any other software or web programming required to track the ad.


The cost of general website tracking may seem like a large investment at first, but it shouldn't be reflected as an investment for a single ad. This upfront investment will allow you to track many ads at once, so you may choose to split the investment over a series of ads when you calculate return on investment.

, New advertising campaigns should be checked at least a few times per week, if not daily. Ask this person to regularly gather data on your campaign's metrics that can be used for reports.

, Divide the return or sales figures for a period by the cost of the ad during that period. This percentage is your ROI.


If you are not selling products on your site, then you should monetize your metrics to figure out the ROI. For example, if you are gathering contacts in a database, establish how much each person's information sells for and multiply that by the number of people in the new database. If you are looking for an increase in page views, divide the number of new views by the investment cost to get a ratio of cost per view.

, Calculate the ROI for all your advertising campaigns for the same period. Rate their effectiveness and remove all ads that are not profitable or give very little ROI.

Make the site easy on the eyes.,
Keep it simple.,
Keep a consistent theme.,
Embrace white space.,
Use short paragraphs.",How to Make Your Website Popular2," Even if your site is text-heavy, it should be visually appealing to keep people from making snap judgments about the quality. If you don’t have much design sense, have an artistic friend give it the once over, ask an older relative whether or not they find the site easy to navigate, or even consider hiring a designer to work on the overall composition.

, Streamline every page so that people don’t get disoriented or frustrated. Avoid using elaborate fonts, numerous colors, or unnecessary graphics that slow down the page-load time (or make people think they’re looking at an over-enthusiastic PowerPoint presentation).

, Use the same banner at the top (and bottom, if applicable) of every page so that people can navigate your site with ease. Tie all your pages together with a color scheme so that people don’t think they’ve been mysteriously transported somewhere else with every click. Be consistent in your font usage by sticking with no more than three fonts, making section all headers the same size, all subsection headers a different size, etc.

, If you’re afraid that leaving white space will drive visitors away, just look at any Google page. White space helps a page look clean and uncluttered, to say nothing of the fact that it makes navigation much easier.

Use a great domain name.,
Read How to Design a Website for SEO for more pointers.

",How to Make Your Website Popular3," Keywords capitalize on internet trends, draw visitors, and make your page likelier to come up in searches. Good places to include keywords include the headings, URLs (multiple words should be separated by dashes, ex. “Make-Your-Website-Popular”), and meta-tags.


Use tags and keywords accurately. If search engines detect that you are trying to manipulate your site ranking by using tags and keywords where they don’t actually apply, it will negatively affect your performance. (It won’t go over well with your visitors particularly well, either.)

, The old-fashioned way to do this is by link-swapping – that is, offering to link to someone else if they’ll link to you. Though this can still be very useful when two sites have a good reason to be linked, another approach is to post articles on other sites that link back to yours. These articles need to be informative, engaging, and high-quality. Above all else, they should not look spammy with links that stick out like sore thumbs.


If you are a decent writer, you can do these yourself, but otherwise it may be worth your while to hire someone else to do them. Guest blogs, for example, are a good way to do this.

, In addition to making visitors likelier to come back for more, this lets search engines know your page hasn’t been abandoned or rendered irrelevant.

, If your domain name is overcomplicated, hard to spell, or obscure, it won’t attract the readership you deserve. Of course, the best domain names come at a steep price, so you will have to strike a balance between your desired domain-name performance and your budget. Read this for more tips on choosing and buying a cheap domain name.

The first is a resource site, and the second is a review site. Which model you choose will depend on your familiarity with the products or services you advertise.Resource sites typically embed a merchant partner's website in an affiliate link or banner advertisement within how-to articles and posts. This business model requires frequent updates and fresh content to ensure that customers return to the marketer's website on a regular basis.Review sites feature reviews of products/services that the marketer has tried and can attest for. Each product/service review includes a link or banner ad that will take customers to the merchant partner's website. The advantage of review sites is that they require less frequent updates. Marketers simply have to make minor tweaks to their websites to ensure that search engines continue to list the website in their search results.;
, In order to work as an affiliate marketer, you'll need your own platform (a personal website or blog) on which to post links and advertise for your chosen products or services. If you already have a website or blog, you can use that platform to begin earning additional income as an affiliate marketer. If you do not yet have a website or blog, you will need to create one.


The advantage of a blog, such as Blogger, is that it's free to operate, whereas some websites require a fee to operate. However, sites like GoDaddy.com and Hostgator offer website services that are relatively inexpensive to operate, and may look more professional than a personal blog.Consider joining up with an affiliated marketing company. One easy way to enter the field of affiliate marketing is to join a company that specializes in online marketing. Though you'll ultimately work independently, companies like MoreNiche allow aspiring affiliate marketers to join for free to have a platform for advertising products/services.Some websites allow you to engage in pay-per-click affiliate marketing without running your own website or blog. Direct links through outside merchant websites allow you to create and make money off of ads without having to post them to your own website. For instance, you might make an ad for a dating website and advertise on Facebook; when someone clicks on your ad, they go straight to the dating site, instead of a website or landing page you have created.Some affiliate networks that specialize in direct linking include Associate Programs, Affiliates Directory, E-commerce Guide, and Link Share., Most affiliate marketers choose a niche, or area of specialization. Before you begin marketing products or services, you'll need to find an area you can easily work within to advertise.Your niche doesn't necessarily need to be an area you're already an expert in. You can also choose a specialized area which you're enthusiastic or interested in learning more about.The initial startup work can be very intensive, so it's important to choose a niche in which you won't mind working for prolonged periods. This can help set you up for success as you get your new career off the ground., Once you've chosen a niche in which to work, you're ready to start finding products and services to promote on your platform. The products/services you choose to promote, as well as how much work you'll have to put in, will vary depending on your chosen niche.A company like Commission Junction is ideal for marketers who want to promote more traditional products/services. Commission Junction is involved in a diverse range of potential advertising opportunities, which may be ideal for newcomers to the field who haven't narrowed down their niche yet.Marketers interested in digital content, like e-books and software, may enjoy working with companies like Amazon, Clickbank, E-junkie, and PayDotCom.Pay-per-click (PPC) marketing models like Google AdSense may appeal to some marketers. PPC models pay considerably less than other marketing models, but the advantage is that they require less active work of the marketer. The marketer's pay is determined by how much web traffic is directed to the target site., Affiliates will help grow your business and help you tap into web traffic. There are many ways to meet and engage with affiliates, but the best way to access desirable affiliates is by building a reputation for yourself. You can do this by developing a popular blog or otherwise earning a large online following, or by becoming a published author of a book or article.There are other ways of meeting affiliates, of course, and each method will vary in its success and required effort. Generally speaking, the basic course of action for acquiring affiliates typically involves one of the following methods:


Emailing or otherwise contacting other bloggers and online marketers who share a common niche and asking them to either promote your product, or engaging in a mutually-beneficial cross-promotion wherein both you and the other blogger promote one another's productsFinding successful affiliates online, either through forums, mutual contacts, or affiliate networks (such as Clickbank or Commission Junction) that you can join online, Once you've built a popular platform and secured affiliates to work with, you'll need to drive traffic to your affiliate program. There are a number of ways to accomplish this, but one of the easiest and most successful methods involves writing a blog post or web article and using your email newsletter to invite your subscribers to join the affiliate program of your choosing.Other methods include:


Giving away free content to other websites (which may drive traffic to your links)Using viral marketing, like a link at the end of newsletters that allows readers to pass the newsletter on to other readers quickly and easilySecuring free links on websites that already drive a lot of traffic, A quick and easy way to gain experience and familiarity as an affiliate marketer is by joining an online community or forum. These online resources are free to join and can offer invaluable advice to marketers at all experience levels.Digital Point, aBestWeb, and Warrior Forum are excellent and free resources for affiliate marketers. In addition to advice from more experienced marketers, these forums also offer networking opportunities to connect with other marketers., Affiliate marketing takes a lot of work and patience before any real money is made. Affiliate marketing programs drive traffic to the affiliate marketer's website, but the marketer is responsible for building lasting professional relationships with the affiliate partners out of that web traffic. The marketer must also continually seek out better partnerships with other affiliates.Learn how your affiliate partners prefer to communicate. Every partner will have a different work schedule and communication preferences, and it falls on you to respect those preferences.Know what your affiliates need and expect from you.Brainstorm new ideas to pitch to your affiliates. You should do a substantial amount of research on your affiliates' websites, and know how they can improve their websites and services.Seek feedback from your affiliates on how you can improve your own platform., It's not enough to get people to visit your website or blog. In order to generate money from your marketing platform, you'll need to get people to click your affiliates' links.There are four primary methods of attracting potential customers:



Paid advertising — this method requires an effective combination of ad copy, graphics, and a highly-clickable link.Unlike more traditional affiliate marketing strategies, paid advertising (through pay-per-click ads) earn you money regardless of whether a reader buys the product or not. Services like Google's AdSense make this quick and easy for you, and can even supply you with an advertising code.Free advertising — this method involves placing links and advertisements on free websites, like Craigslist or US Free Ads. Whenever someone clicks on your ad, both you and the website (for example, Craigslist) earn money from the clicks.Article marketing — this method seeks to gain a higher ranking in search engine results by establishing the marketer as a credible source that won't use spam software.Many marketers use websites like Ezine Articles to publish articles that contain a unique ""resource box,"" and as other bloggers and website managers republish the article (with the resource box intact), the marketer who published the original article gradually earns higher search engine rankings.Email marketing — in this method, marketers embed an email subscription option for website visitors. This allows the marketer to acquire a site visitor's name and email address, which can help build a lasting relationship and expose the visitor to the marketer's newsletter.9

, Pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements are the bread and butter of affiliate marketing, but how well you craft your ad could be the difference between success and failure. A strong PPC ad should:


Address a specific problem that consumers might be facing, and call attention to a solution or benefit that the product offersUse a strong and specific keyword that will help drive traffic (for help choosing appropriate keywords, use Google's free AdWords Keyword Tool)Reflect the keywords used on the primary ""landing"" (linked-to) pageWork in an imperative or call to action to gently urge consumers to click through your link, Having a vast network of affiliates will not necessarily help you earn more money. According to some experts, the key to successful affiliate marketing is to find the right affiliates that will drive the most results for your platform. Those affiliates may be big sites, small sites, or a combination of the two, but the most important thing is to build and maintain strong relationships with your chosen affiliates., Many people breaking into affiliate marketing expect to get rich quick. However, it takes a lot of work to get your affiliate marketing business off the ground, especially in the early stages. Some marketers work 12 hours each day, seven days a week as they try to launch and develop their platforms.Keep in mind the field is very competitive and many marketing companies are run by professional marketers or large companies cable of spending large sums to attract traffic.

, An affiliate marketer embeds her own unique affiliate link in her web page or blog. This link does not have any impact on customers, and it does not alter the price of any products/services being offered by affiliates. However, any time the customer makes a purchase after clicking an affiliate link within a specified time frame, the marketer gets a commission from that sale. How much you earn will depend on each affiliate's prices, commission percentages, and the number of sales you're able to initiate on a weekly or monthly basis., Every affiliate will have their own target demographic. As the affiliate marketer, it's your job to understand your affiliates' demographics, and tailor your advertisements or reviews in such a way that that target demographic will be reached through your platform. Knowing, for example, the target demographic's age, interests, and average income range, will help you tailor your reviews and advertisements to that demographic."

Learn the steps of Internet analysis, if you want to learn Internet marketing for free.,
Interpret the data that you have gathered.,
Develop a strategy.,
Create online marketing campaigns and track them well.,
Understand that Internet marketing is constantly changing.",How to Learn Internet Marketing2," For anyone who knows the basics of social media, search engine optimization (SEO), Google news and website building blocks, then you can likely learn Internet marketing on your own. A big part of marketing is understanding your competitors, data and market analysis.


Determine your market. This is something that should be obvious from the moment you choose a service or item to market. However, you may need to research what portion of that market is online and what portion is done through phone or in-person sales.
Determine who your main online competitors are. Research how they work, how they market and how big of a market share you believe they have. Sign up for e-newsletters, research their press releases and determine the strengths and weaknesses of each online competitor. You may even need to purchase something from them in order to understand how they complete their sales process.
Determine who your ideal customer is. For any product, you should be able to see who is buying the product. After you determine your demographic, you can determine where they spend their time on the Internet.

, Make reports using Google Analytics, software or spreadsheets that show the market, competition and customer data. You can find software or online programs that can help you make reports or charts to show where your ideal customer is shopping and who your main competitors are.


This is especially important if you have superiors to which you must report about Internet marketing. Although you may be able to turn data into a strategy easily, reports and graphs are essential in order to communicate that data to people who control the budget. Spend time making comprehensive reports and perhaps making a PowerPoint presentation based on your research.

, Use the research and conclusions from your reports to develop a successful strategy to reach your target demographic. Start by using the methods that were successful for your competitors, then look for more innovative approaches.


Your strategy will most likely require a budget to hire writers to do SEO articles, graphic designers to do ads, and web designers to update or create a website. You may also need to hire people to update your business's social media accounts daily.

, Make sure your site uses analytics or use Google Analytics so that you know which methods are successful and which are not. This is an often forgotten rule of Internet marketing, but it is the only way to see your return on investment (ROI).


Internet marketing almost always includes launching many campaigns at once, which is why they are so important to track. A website may be marketing through e-mail blasts, You Tube videos, social media accounts, web banners, affiliate marketers, SEO, blogs and more.
Understand that search engines are the key to most online marketing. Businesses are looking for ways to make sure their site and product are listed on the first page of a Google, Yahoo or Bing search. The main ways of doing this are SEO, meta tags, press releases, social media content, videos and paying for an ad to be placed at the top or side of the search page.

, Sign up for newsletters or blogs that keep you tuned into the newest social media channels, marketing articles and innovative companies. Invest in marketing or programming classes, if you think they would boost your Internet marketing knowledge considerably.

Put lots of effort into creating your set.,
Submit your set to the max of five groups.,
Change the groups that your set is submitted to regularly.,
Optionally, you can create your own group and invite lots of people to join it.

,
Submit your set to as many different contests as possible.

,
Make sure you have a lot of contacts.

,
Comment regularly on other peoples sets (contacts or not), this makes it is very likely they will comment back on yours and is the best way of attracting interest.

,
Add hash tags.,
Add tag lists of people.,
Make your sets visually appealing and unique.",How to Make Your Polyvore Set Popular," The better it is, the easier it will be to promote.;
, In choosing the groups:


Make sure they are relevant.
Try to choose a mixture of specialised groups, for example, punk, and general groups, everyone on Polyvore.
Choose semi-popular groups with a few hundred members; it they're too unpopular, no one will ever check the page. Equally though, if they're too popular, your set will be knocked off the 'recent sets' section too quickly.

, Change it perhaps every two-four weeks.

,,,,, When you make your set, put # (hash tags) on them so when people search for the relevant word, your set/collection/group will come up.


For example, if your set has a day dress in it put #daydress. Make such it relates to your set.

, Add someone like @shans10, for example. Then that person will see your set, thank you for the tag and look on your wall. People may then tag you back!

,


For example, don't make an outfit with a bland t-shirt and skinny jeans. Polyvore is used to be creative, not show what you wear every day.
Let's be honest, those sets with items far apart, photographs that aren't incorporated well, and overused (and ugly) fonts and background colors are eyesores. Use only photographs with muted colors in the background to make it visually appealing but not distracting, and try using newspaper articles and quotes to make it look cool. When you aren't putting anything in the background, try to organize your items so that they fit well together, like pieces of a puzzle.

Check the site's name.,
Check for emphasis of certain words.,
Many web-sites will ask for your e-mail address.,
Probably common knowledge, but good common knowledge is the e-mail tip.,
Make sure your anti-virus is up to date and, also, not a scam.,
Set up parental controls.",How to Know if a Site Is Trustworthy," In other words, a site might ask you to pay to paypol.com and includes a link on the site. This is NOT a PayPal site. The misspelling is on purpose, and used to lure people in. Another example could be lastfm.com, which is a site that sells music. However, there is also last.fm.com, too. Apparently, the latter name takes you to a mock/scam version of the site.;
, For example, the mock site last.fm.com entices you into downloading by over-using the word FREE. Certain cases of similar sites go along the lines of ""Get your FREE music. Click now."" or ""FREE file viewer. FREE download."" and should be avoided.

, 90% of the time, this is a scam that sends plenty of spam, and seriously slows down your computer. Don't give it to them if it is optional. If it isn't, just don't go on the site. If you REALLY want on the site, use sites like guerrillamail.com, which creates an address that lasts only an hour. This can be helpful, but not practical for most people.

, What that means is to look out for specific signs of a worm or other virus in an e-mail. Older versions of e-mail sent viruses that had an attached link, with an uncommon ending. For example, a famous form of this targeted at male users was the ""nude"" mail. It said that the attachment was a picture of naked, but the ending, instead of a .png or .jpeg, was .ho, which is not a picture format and thus not a picture. Other newer and more dangerous forms of the virus were that you didn't even have to open the attachment to get your pc infected. Look out for signs like the message being forwarded many times before you, as most of these viruses automatically send themselves to everyone in your contacts. Also look out for messages from an unknown sender.

, For example, there are pop-ups that say things like ""you have # viruses and # worms."" and they look legit with a name either realistic for anti-virus software or they are based closely off of real anti-virus programs. Advised sites include avg.com and can be trusted. Just make sure you get it from avg.com because many sites have avg anti-virus downloads.

, Young children and the elderly tend to be very trusting in the internet and can inadvertently get dozens of viruses on their, or your, system.

, In many ways, the best way to learn about PPC is to learn by doing. The following is a good way to learn about ad formation, reporting and results. It is best if you already have a website for a business, where you track sales and traffic.


Pull reports from your website to see how much web traffic you have had for the last month. If your business is highly seasonal or you have had some big promotions recently, gather reports from a few months to a year. If you have a shopping cart, download or write a report quantifying recent sales. It is important to have baseline figures so that you can compare new reports after doing PPC marketing.
Choose a few keywords that you believe customers would use to look for your website. Make sure you choose highly targeted keywords, like ""snow boots,"" instead of general words like ""warm clothing."" You will use these keywords to set up your PPC ads on search engines.
Sign into your Google AdWords account. Click on ""Create your First Campaign."" Choose your bid, or how much you will pay per click and choose a budget. You can decide how much you will spend on this ad. Since it is a trial run, you may want to set the amount quite low.
Decide how you want your ad to look. Type in text, links, maps and anything else that you or your marketing team have determined are effective messages.
Target your ad selecting certain demographics, geographical areas, languages and devices. If you know your products are popular in certain areas, then this is a good way to ensure your ad targets your ideal Internet surfer.
Click on ""Save and continue."" Make sure that Google AdWords has your billing information listed on your account so that they can bill you. Experiment on Google to see how noticeable your ad is. Then, monitor it regularly. You may want to continue the ad for a week or month. Then, compare your sales and traffic against your results as reported by Google and your own website.

, Search for YouTube users ""daveerasmusblog"" and ""seobook"" for your introductory tutorials.

Some common top-level domains include .com, .edu, .org, and .net, which stand for commercial, education, organization, and network respectively. Try to match the top-level domain to your website's purpose. However, some top-level domains have no real restrictions (such as org and com), so if the name you want is taken under one domain, it may be available in another.;
, Obtain a host and secure the bandwidth necessary to keep your website running smoothly, given the expected traffic. Bandwidth is the amount of data transfer you are allowed within a given time period.


You may need to buy more bandwidth as your website grows or else your visitors may experience lag, which could drive them away from your website. Many hosts also provide software to aid you in building your website.

, One is kept solely on your hard drive where only you can see it and use it for editing, while the other is used by your web host and its content is viewable by anyone with access to the Internet.

, If a person cannot find what they are looking for on your website within 30 seconds, there is a good chance they will leave and never return. Organizing your website into specific sections and then providing links to those sections at the top of each page is an effective and simple way to make your website easy to navigate.

, Validate your HTML, CSS, XHTML, JavaScript, and XML codes to ensure that your website has clean code and function as intended for visitors. There are several programs available online that validate each type of code.

, Site maps aid search engines in accurately indexing your website. A site map is a collection of the various URLs comprising your website. By creating a site map, you allow search bots to find and display the essential pages of your website.

, You should thoroughly test your website to confirm that your design and page structure are displayed as intended. Specifically, view your website with the most popular browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari, as those browsers are used by the majority of people who are browsing the Internet.

, Utilise both Meta and ALT tags to ensure that your website not only appears in user searches but that pertinent keywords from the content of your website are displayed. Doing so will more likely pique searchers' interests and will facilitate more visits to your website. ALT tags are merely a written description to go along with the pictures on your website, and so they are necessary to tell search engines and searchers what kind of pictures you have on your website.

, The statistics you'll be able to monitor include the number of visits your website receives, the amount of time visitors stay, the average number of page views for each visitor, and many other useful statistics. Making use of such software will enable you to make adjustments to the website to increase its effectiveness.

, The copy of your website on your computer is called the local version, and the copy on the web host is called the production version. Now your website's launch will be complete.

Develop good headlines.,
Write articles rich in content.,
Address a niche.,
Create shareable content.,
Vary your article length.,
Write articles frequently.,
Tag and describe your articles appropriately.,
Build good links.,
Link to old posts on your own site.,
Organize your content into categories.,
Give freebies.",How to Increase Website Traffic1," Headlines are the first thing readers see, and are typically the only thing they see if the article is shared. Your headlines should jump out at the reader and quickly draw their attention. A good headline can dramatically increase your views when shared on a social network.


See this guide for a detailed breakdown of what makes an effective headline.;
, Quality articles will get ranked better in search results. Make sure that your articles address the needs of your readers, and that they can find all of the information they need in one spot. This is the most effective means for increasing traffic to a website; offering people something that they cannot obtain elsewhere, or at least, not to the level of quality that you are offering it.Create content that is helpful and useful. Simply cobbling together information from another website will not generate traffic. You need to offer visitors the information they need to achieve a goal, solve a problem, be entertained, find out quality news, or just have a good laugh.
Avoid content generators. While these were once the delight of a fledgling web industry, they are no longer useful. Putting your own team's creativity online is what is useful.
Never copy and paste from another website - Google, Yahoo, MSN and other search engines are too smart for this nowadays and will detect copied and unoriginal content, sending you to the bottom of the pile.

, Good sites address a specific niche or audience and then become an expert in that field. You want your site to be the one resource that your readers go to first. Either start a site based on an interest of yours, or examine the market and find a niche that hasn't been addressed well. Turn that niche into your expertise.

, In the world of social media, shareable content is king. Your content should be easily share-able so that your readers can spread the word for you. This is a combination of a good headline and an interesting image, as well as a captivating lead-in. All of this creates a perfect bite-sized chunk of your article that others can share through Facebook, Twitter, and other networks.Lists are incredibly popular for sharing on social networks right now. Sites such as Buzzfeed and Mashable make great use of list headlines, such as ""10 Ways to..."" or ""21 Signs That You're..."". These quickly draw the reader's eye, and are a great way to deal with shortened attention spans.

, You should have long, comprehensive articles as well as short and to-the-point articles. Let the content dictate the size; don’t spend too long belaboring a simple point, but don’t be too brief when detail is called for. research suggests the average length should be around 1,600 words, though feel free to vary as you see fit.

, Your blog will be more successful if you have a steady stream of content. Aim for at least six articles per week. Whatever you choose, pick a schedule and stick to it as best as possible.


Keep it fresh. For repeat visits, it is crucial to provide regular updates to the website, especially in frequently viewed zones. Add fresh content every few days if possible; at a minimum, weekly.
Consider outsourcing article writing. If you hate the thought of generating content yourself, or your team is not writing-savvy, consider outsourcing this end of the task. Depending on the length, content, specialization and quality required, prices can start as low as US$5 per article. However, don't neglect attempting to write your own work - who better than you knows your own business, hobby or club and can express precisely what needs to be said?

, The tags, description, and metadata of your article will affect how well it shows up in searches. It also helps people find the articles they need.


To have a fully functioning and successful website, you need to make sure your tags are in place and your links are not broken. You also need to submit a sitemap file to Google to have your website show up in Google's search engines.

Use keywords effectively. This is called search engine optimization and will help people find your website when they're searching the Web. Make sure the keywords flow naturally with the text and when you are brainstorming for good words, ask around for words that come naturally to people of all ages when looking for your type of site.
Keywords not only go into headings and page names but also into ""meta tags"". ""Meta tags"" are the software code that website visitors do not see but search engines do.
Don't overdo the keywords; over-stuffing keywords will result in a very low search ranking for your website. Also, be very careful not to place key text inside graphics; search engines cannot pick up graphics.

, Link building is incredibly important for websites. This is the process of creating links that point to your page from other pages. This will happen naturally as you create quality content, but there are some things you can do to help build links yourself:

Trading links with other websites that are closely related to the subject of your website can bring you more website traffic. These are two-way links because you must provide a link to them, too, and linking to low-quality websites can threaten the credibility of yours. Only link to sites that are dead on topic, and truly help your visitors.
Link back on related blogs and forums. Find communities that relate to your niche and create a user profile there. Enter in your site information in your profile and make quality posts. This will draw people to your site through your profile links.
Contact companies that relate to your niche. Getting a company to link to your site for a how-to article, or a blog post related to their product, can significantly increase your traffic. Try to build some links with companies in your niche.
Set up an RSS feed. An RSS feed allows your articles to be easily linked in a variety of other places. Submitting your RSS feed to directories can really give your links a boost.
See this guide for more details on building back links.

, Make sure that you are linking to related articles that you've already written. This will help new users find interesting articles from your backlog, and will keep people on your site.


Add links on old posts to new ones. If you write an article that relates to an old article that you did, make sure to go back to the old article and link to the new one.

, A well-organized site is much more useful for readers, and will lead to better retention. It can also help increase the views on your older articles.

, Who doesn't like a freebie?! Online freebies are commonplace and they leave the visitor wanting more when they are well written and informative introductory materials. Consider such freebies as:


Giving away an eBook with your ad on it. Allow your visitors to also give the freebie away. This will increase your ad exposure and increase web traffic to your website at the same time;
Holding free online classes or seminars. They could be held in your website's chat room. The idea of ""live"" information will definitely entice people to visit your website. You will become known as an expert on the topic.
Giving visitors a free entry into your contest or sweepstakes. The prizes should be something of interest or value to your visitors. Most people who enter will continually revisit your web site to get the results.
Letting visitors download free software such as freeware, shareware, demos etc. You could even turn part of your site into a free software directory. If you created the software, include your ad inside and let other people give it away.
Targeting specific groups who might worry about using the internet with free classes in using it on your site - senior citizens, busy workers etc. might find these convenient and alluring.
Offering free online services or utilities from your website. For instance, they could be search engine submitting, copyrighting, proofreading etc. The service or utility should be helpful to your target audience.
Giving free consulting to people who visit your website. You could offer your knowledge via e-mail or by telephone. People will consider this a huge value because consulting fees can be very expensive.
Offering a free start-up package that has a finite time; enough time for the customer to practice with your online product and like it enough to pay for continued use.
Sending out free CDs, DVDs etc. that contain starter packs or teasers to encourage the customer to use your site more.
Offering free screensavers or templates for business cards, cards, writing paper etc., anything that a customer can print out.

As your site grows, you may need to appoint moderators to your forum. If a community grows toxic, it can have a negative effect on the traffic to your site. A good moderation policy is always important for online communities.

, Besides using links, you must make use of numerous other ways to increase web traffic. There a lot of ways you can advertise your site, both online and offline:


If you have money, consider pay per click. The big search engines like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft provide advertising packages. But find out first how to limit your expenditure to the level you want.
Go beyond the electronic medium and into the print medium. Advertise in local newspapers, business brochures, magazines, nationwide publications and mail-drop literature. And don't forget the perennial favorite, the good old Yellow Pages™ - printed version naturally!
Small business cards left in cafés, on signboards, exchanged at meetings etc.
Use local resources such as clubs, libraries and community centers for non-profit website awareness raising.
Use word of mouth. Tell everyone you know about your website, give out business cards to passers-by in the street, and so on. You might even want to run a guerrilla marketing program!
Use your car, especially if your website is area-specific (e.g. a website detailing local events or selling local services). Get some vinyl decals or bumper stickers created and turn your car into a moving advertisement, literally driving traffic to your web site!

Build a cohesive, modern design for your site.,
Balance your page.,
Keep it simple.,
Take clear, high-quality photographs.,
Create a navigation menu.,
Commission art for your site.,
Create infographics.,
Start a podcast.,
Create a YouTube channel link it to your site.",How to Increase Website Traffic4," If your site is hard to look at, you won’t retain many visitors. Make sure that your style matches your niche, and that it is modern enough to be pleasing to the eye and easy to navigate.

, To improve your website, balance your page because when users enter a website, their focus first starts at the top left of the page and hovers there before slowly tracking to the right. The web user is focused more on the text of the page, rather than images or graphics. This is where balance comes into place.Balance will not only make your page more visually appealing, but it will make your page easier to read and items easier to find. A good object will help the objects on your page flow.

, If you clean your website up by removing all the unnecessary visual elements, it will allow important items to stand out. You should leave some white space on the page so the illusion of the space is visually pleasing, as well as easier to navigate.


Use clean backgrounds. The background textures and color you choose have the ability to drastically affect the overall appeal of the website. Lots of texture and graphics in the background can be distracting. If you are going to use a color on the background, you should make sure there is significant contrast between the background color and the text. Be careful when using brighter and darker colors such as red or yellow. They cause visual fatigue (temporary loss of strength and energy resulting from hard physical or mental work) and the reader will lose their focus on the text.

, If you are using photographs on your site, ensure that they are as high-quality as possible. This may mean investing in a better camera if you take your own photos.

, For easy navigation, you should create a toolbar with links that are easy to navigate and position the toolbar in an area that makes sense. Web users often look for the toolbar across the top or down the left the left hand side of the page. You shouldn't forget a link to your homepage. It’s often forgotten but very important to point your users to your homepage.

, If you don’t have much artistic flair, you can commission art for your site to give it a professional look. This can cost a little money, but can have a big impact on the feel of your site.

, These are very shareable, and dominate social media feeds. There are sites online that can create infographics for you based on your data and template choices.

, Podcasts are a popular way to share your thoughts and views with your readers. They can listen to your podcasts on the go, and you can even earn money from them.

, If your suite lends itself to video, consider linking a YouTube channel to it. You can embed YouTube videos in your blog posts and send YouTube viewers to your blog for more details. You can even monetize your YouTube channel for additional revenue.

Figure out what your keywords are in the page.,
Look at the keyword list, and pick the main 2 to 5 keywords that describe the subject matter or topic of the page.,
Purge the keywords of special characters.,
Drop any periods from your keywords.,
Create a page URL that contains those few primary keywords.",How to Make URLs SEO Friendly," (Keywords are the few words you expect people to type into the search engine when looking for what your web page will give them.) Certain common words are ignored by search engines. In SEO, these common words are called ""stop words."" Remove any stop words from your keyword list.;
, Too few keywords won't help you much, but too many will produce keyword spam, which is off-putting to search engines and live visitors alike. Many websites offer ""density checker"" tools to scan a web page and tell you what the top keywords are, but you'll also want to use online resources to check how stiff the competition is for those keywords.

, URLs have to reinterpret special characters into a code, which doesn't work well with many social networking sites. (For example, %20 is the code for a space in a URL.)

, Periods aren't recognized by search engines, so they don't affect your URL SEO. Including the period can confuse programs about what file type your web page actually is.

, Use all lower-case letters because that is what most people generally will look for, and URLs are case-sensitive.

Take a deep breath.,
Read through the comments to understand why you're suddenly being attacked.,
Closing comments, deleting comments, and judicious use of your ban options often seem to be good ideas, especially in the midst of a large attack.,
If the attack is a simple hate attack (e.g.,
On the other hand, if the attack is over something you've done, but there's a lot of false accusations, trolling, or hate from some users, screencap everything, delete defamatory accusations and trolling and ban users involved in such conduct, but don't delete legitimate complaints or ban people simply for disagreement.,
Screencap everything involved, especially if you plan on using deletion as an option.

,
If the attack is over something you have said or done, you have three best options.,
If the attack is over a false accusation, from a stalker, hate-based, or from trolls or spammers, you can and should make a public or private response, along with noting openly why you banned/deleted/closed comments on an entry.

,
If you apologize, do so sincerely, without passive-aggressiveness or excuses.,
If you choose to stand your ground over your behavior or what you said, keep in mind that this will earn you friends and enemies.,
Ask yourself if it's worth it - do you really want to be known as the person who started a 10 page fight over the size of a rock singer's genitals?",How to Respond to a Blog Attack," Be calm.;
, Is it something you have said or done? Is it a stalker? Are you being mistaken for someone else? Is it a hate incident? Why exactly are you being attacked?

, They may be good options, depending on the type of attack, but otherwise they should be used very selectively if at all.

, you did nothing, and you're being attacked for your race, gender, sexual orientation, culture, appearance, etc.), screencap and delete the material and ban everyone involved in attacking you. Alternately, you can close the comments but leave them visible and comment on the incident, if you choose.

, Acknowledge the legitimate complaints (see apology, later).

,, You can delete everything and/or friends lock the place in question until the attackers go away, you can stand your ground, or you can apologize.

,, The article on apologies here is a good start. Be aware, though, that apologizing can sometimes open the gates for more problems. (see warnings)

, It may also make you a permanent target for stalkers or people who think you're a ""lolcow"" for doing it.

, On the other hand, being known as the person who got into a fight over whether a board's ""no inappropriate comments ever"" rule might be a little less laughable.

Use Schema on your site.",How to Increase Organic Traffic," Put yourself in the shoes of your clients and perform searches on content that’s relevant to your business. Think about both recurring trends and current fads you’ve noticed in your market and use those as a basis for your research. Look for information that a customer would want to learn but that’s not coming up in your searches.Ask yourself, “if I was a customer looking for my product or service, what else might I want to know about it that’s missing from what’s been written?”


For example, if you are in the pet grooming business and have had numerous customers ask about DIY dog shampoo recently, find out what information is and isn’t already available online about that.
If you’re in the restaurant business and always have customers asking about food safety laws, see what articles have and haven’t been written about the subject already.;
, Once you’ve located information that’s missing from the web, begin writing authoritative, well-researched, and relevant content that addresses the needs of your customers. Use your experience and knowledge of your market to write articles, press releases (if applicable), and update pages on your own website. Practice white-hat SEO techniques: this basically means writing legitimate and original content that’s designed for people, not search engines. Focus only on educational, informative, funny, or interesting content.


For the pet grooming example, write an article about the best ingredients for DIY dog shampoos or a how-to guide about making your own.
For the restaurant example, research the food safety laws in your jurisdiction and have an easy-to-navigate FAQ page on your site that lays out the information customers might want to know.
Publish articles and other content on your own site, and also submit it to respected directories and information sites, and pitch to other high-quality sites in a similar niche to yours.
Include relevant links to your site in all the PR content you send out., You may need to ask your web programmer to install a blog platform, such as Tumblr or WordPress on your website. Learn to use the platform yourself or assign someone else to manage it.


Write about relevant topics that you think would be interesting and engaging for your clients. Use blog posts to write about specific aspects of your market. Remember, customers will read a blog to learn something new, have a laugh, or because they find the topic truly interesting, not because they want to hear about how great your company is.

, High-quality information, expert advice, and guest bloggers will drive more traffic to your site because it will make it easier for search engines to find. Create links to your guest bloggers’ sites as well, but don’t rely solely on these for traffic generation.


Write at least one blog per week, and more if possible. Think about hiring a freelance writer or content specialist who can take care of them for you if it’s in the budget.
Identify key events throughout the year that relate to your business or market and create a content schedule that coincides with those dates.For instance, a flower shop should have content ready for all the major holidays, especially Mother’s Day.

, The images break up the text, make your site more attractive, and can increase the number of times your site appears in image search results.


Always include text links and tags with images for people who disable them.

, The same blog rules apply to newsletters: use newsletters to share content that’s interesting, informative, or funny for your customers. Include links back to your site and social media accounts, and encourage people to visit your website that way.


Always ask new customers for email addresses that you can add to your existing client list. Have links or popups on your site where customers can sign up for news and information.

, Find people in similar (though not identical) markets and respectfully ask if they’ll repost or forward your content on to more potential clients. Be brief about your pitch.

, Create a list of about 10 topics your clients are most likely to use when looking for your product or service.Once you’ve got those topics, brainstorm words and phrases that customers might use as search terms when researching those topics.


Keywords are important because if you identify what search terms your clients are using to find the products or services you offer, you can use those keywords to drive new clients to your site. If customers can’t find your site because you haven’t used the right keywords, it doesn’t matter how great your content is.

, When you’ve got a list of possible keywords, run them through a keyword search tool. You want to identify terms that are relevant to your business, and have both a high search volume and low competition. Some possible keyword tools include:


Google AdWords Keyword Planner Tool
Google Trends
Microsoft Bing Ads Intelligence
Wordtracker’s Free Basic Keyword Demand
HubSpot’s Keywords

, These are very specific keyword phrases that consist of three or four words.Long-tail will also help you attract the right kind of visitors to your site, as most customers who use them are in the later phases of shopping. This means long-tail keywords are used by people who aren’t just browsing anymore, but are ready to buy.The most popular one-word keywords will have a great deal of competition, and getting yourself to the top of search rankings will be nearly impossible if you focus on those, as you’ll be competing with the biggest and richest companies.
Good long-tail keywords are specific, and can even include location information. For example, if you’re in the mom-and-pop furniture business, competing with large corporations will be difficult. So instead of focusing on short, competitive keywords like “furniture,” try “kitchen tables Knoxville TN,” for instance.

, Rewrite your existing content to include them as well. But it’s important to avoid keyword stuffing. Search engine algorithms prefer content and normal language over keywords, so use them intelligently and incorporate them naturally into your text to avoid content that looks like spam.

, Everything you post from now on should use your keywords. This includes image descriptions and tags, all titles and page titles, alternative descriptions (alt tags), and the URLs on your site if possibleThis keyword use will help increase your ranking.


Add a custom URL on each image that links back to your site. When someone clicks one of your images on an image search, they’ll be redirected back to your site.
Separate keywords in a URL with hyphens if you have more than one., A meta-description is what shows up on a page of search results. Although it doesn’t affect rankings, it will either encourage or discourage readers from clicking through to your site.Make titles 60 characters or fewer, with at least one targeted keyword or phrase.
Make your meta-description 160 characters or fewer. Use action verbs to encourage users to click.

, Ask affiliates and partners if they will link to your content, as this will improve organic traffic.

, Facebook has pages especially for businesses that clients can like, follow, and check for information without having to “friend” you. It allows you to instantly share videos, messages, news, and pictures with customers all over the world. If people want to find out more about you and your company, they are likely to look for you on Facebook first, and then check out your website.


Use social media accounts to repost blogs, news, and newsletters from your site.
Share relevant content often and update the account frequently.
Facebook accounts are free, but the site also offers targeted ad campaigns for businesses.

, This is especially important if you are part of a niche industry or you sell business-to-business. Twitter is often used to trade industry information among people in the same markets.


Use Twitter to notify customers in your area about secret sales, pop-up stores, and other special events in real-time.
Involve yourself in trending conversations. People love online communities, and you can use social media to create a community of your own and build brand loyalty.

, This is especially important if any aspect of your business is visual. You can drive interest and traffic to your site by posting images and links that will also be displayed in image searches. For instance:


Restaurants can upload photos of prepared meals and specials of the day to entice customers to come in.
Retail stores can use pictures to suggest different ways to wear their latest styles.

, With social media management sites like Hootsuite or SocialOomph, you can monitor all your accounts and schedule and automate posts. This is a great resource for people who don’t have devoted social media specialists or don’t have the time to spend on each account individually.

, #Hashtags are metadata tags that people use on social media and blogs to categorize content based on topic. They will help more people find your site and allow you to engage with your customers in trending conversations.

, Businesses in similar markets can help each other by trading links without paying any money. Find natural ways to incorporate those links into the content on your site, otherwise your pages will look spammy.


Consider linking with suppliers, affiliates, or retailers who carry your product or sell your service.

, Only link to relevant content on high-quality sites, because low-quality or spam sites can negatively affect your reputation. To get an idea of what kind of sites you should be linking to, look at what links your competitors have on their sites.


Links are about quality, not quantity. One good link to an authoritative site is better than 10 links to irrelevant sites.

, You can also have bloggers write guest blogs on your site, and you can conversely write guest blogs that they’ll post on their sites. Exchange links, and request that their inbound link to your site uses one of your keywords.


Bloggers will often accept free products in exchange for a review of that product and a blog post about it.

, Internal links encourage users to spend more time on your site and make information easier to find, and users will be more likely to see related content.Include links to static, evergreen pages in your blog posts.

, You want to know how people are finding your site and what they click on when they are there. Software like Google Analytics, Bitly, or Bing Webmaster Tools can track different things, including inbound links that are bringing people to your site, broken links, how much time people spend on your site, and specific information about page traffic.

, The backend of a website includes the server, database, and applications. Backend developers deal with the information that is stored on the website for search engines to find.If you have an e-commerce company managing your site, you may have to contact them to make any changes.


You will need to determine the type of site you have and find someone with web coding or design experience in that platform.
Types of sites include WordPress, Drupal, or custom-built.

, SEO tools like those offered by HubSpot ensure all posts are optimized with keywords and links before they are published.

, Structured data is a way of formatting the information on your site so that search engines understand, index, and promote it better.It will also enhance how your content is presented in search results.


Products like Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper can walk you through this process.

, Schema is a form of micro-data that can be encoded on your site to make it easier for search engines to find and comprehend the information on your site. Although it won’t impact your ranking, it will make your site more visible. Like structured data markup, Schema will also improve how your content is displayed on a search page, resulting in a higher click-through rate.The Schema project is a collaboration between all the major search engines, and their site can walk you through the process of encoding your own site.

Search around for web designers.,
Get into contact with a designer.,
Look through their web design portfolio.,
Ask the designer for their rates and costs.,
Speak to the designer's past clients.,
Be sure that the designer can meet your deadlines.,
Make sure you find them enjoyable to work with.",How to Choose a Website Designer," You can perform an Internet search for web designers and you will find numerous results. If you'd rather have the designers come to you, you can place an advertisement in local publications or on Internet job boards, such as Craigslist.;
, Most web design projects are conducted over email. If the job is particularly large or time-critical, they will be conducted over the phone or in person. Tell your prospective designer which method of communication you prefer and stick to that method throughout the entire process.

, A great web designer will always have his own website that showcases his previous work. Ask your prospective designer for a link to his portfolio so you can give it look through. Check to see if you like their design style and check if they are flexible in their designs. If all of their past websites look very similar, they will most likely not be able to customize your site design to fit your specific needs.

, Most designers won't be able to give you an accurate quote until you tell them exactly what you want, so be sure you know what you want before asking. Finding a quality web designer will cost anywhere from $60 to $125 an hour.

, One of the best ways to determine the validity and legitimacy of a web designer is to speak to the people with whom he has worked in the past. Ask them if the designer was easy to work with, if he worked hard to meet the client's goals, and if the final product was worth the cost. If multiple past clients respond positively, then that is a good sign that the designer is worth the money.

, Great web designers will often have more than a single project at any given time. The more projects they're working on, the less time they'll be able to devote to your project, and even the greatest designer will produce mediocre work if they are rushed. Ask the designer if they will be able to meet your deadlines with the expected level of quality.

, By now, you will have spent a good amount of time in contact with the designer regarding your site and your needs and how the designer can best fulfill your demands. If the designer proves difficult to work with, chances are you will not receive the end result that you asked for. In the case of a designer who is hard to work with, you may want to pass and continue looking for another.

Tweeting new posts is an easy task at face value, but you’ll need to spend some time planning it out. This is especially important as your global audience grows.;
, Avoid just writing “New blog!” and linking to your blog. The majority of users will not click on these links, because they don’t speak to them at all. Cover an aspect of your post in the lead-in; if you’re writing about fashion tips, write something like “Wondering what to wear to the club tonight? <link to blog>”. Keep it short and sweet, but make sure that you are directing readers to your content.


Write the lead-in as a question to the reader. “Need to lose a few pounds before swimsuit season?”
Offer advice and create the feeling that the reader needs your wisdom. “10 tips for managing your money.”
Write a fact from your post that will wow the reader. “30 million people can’t be wrong!”

, As your audience grows, you will find that readers are coming to your blog from all different time zones. Your blog tweets can be easily lost when someone checks their Twitter 8 hours after you post. Use a social media management tool such as HootSuite to plan out a schedule of tweets.


Try to post when your readers will be most active. Try to post the blog in the morning, and then support it with tweets later in the day. These tweets will bring in new users who are just getting on the internet for the first time that day.
When tweeting the same article out again, use a different lead-in to keep your tweets from become canned and spammy.

, Use Twitter for more than linking your blog. If your followers only ever see blog posts in your Twitter feed, they will grow fatigued of the links. Add insights and respond to other Twitter users throughout the day.

Compare bandwidth amounts between hosts.,
Test the connection speed.,
Pay attention to uptime claims.,
Make sure the host provides the services you need.,
Confirm that the host offers acceptable security tools.,
Check what operating system the server is using.,
Know the limits of free hosting.,
Balance cost against features.,
Know that good customer support often costs more.,
Avoid buying your domain name from your host.",How to Choose a Web Host," What does your website do? Is it a site that you made for fun to practice or share with friends and family? Is it your blog or other personal site? Is it a company site? Is it a store? The answers to all of these questions will help you determine what you need to look for in a web host.


If you're only making a site to practice or share with friends and family, you can probably get away with free hosting. It will be slow and there may be ads placed on it, but you will be able to practice working with web servers.;
, Is your business expanding rapidly? Are gaining new customers by the day? Do you foresee a significant increase in visitors? There's a good chance that what works for you now will need to be scaled up in the near future. When choosing a web host, always try to keep the future in mind and plan accordingly.


Free hosting sites often make it difficult to transfer your site to a new host when you decide to switch.

, There are three general types of servers offered by web hosting companies: Shared servers, virtual servers, and dedicated servers.


If your website is on a shared server, it will share server resources with other websites on the same server. This is often the most affordable solution, but can lead to the worst performance if other sites are hogging your resources. These are generally not recommended if you are trying to run an eCommerce site.
Virtual servers are virtual dedicated servers, and can provide a lot more stability and greater resources. These are highly recommended for small businesses that run an eCommerce store or have a decent number of monthly visitors.
Dedicated servers are entire physical servers dedicated to just your website. These are typically used for corporate websites or small businesses that do a lot of business or have very high traffic. Dedicated servers are the most expensive option, but have the least downtime and most resources.

, Customer service is one of the most important factors in choosing a web host, because down-time and technical issues can really impact your visitors. Check the support section of each host to see what kind of customer service options they provide.


Being able to talk to someone live is one of the best methods of service. Email support with quick turnaround (24 hours), is another good method.
If the only support the host offers is a support forum, keep looking. You are likely to go days without receiving a response to your support request.

, If there is a support forum or support email address, send a test message or two to see how the response times are, ask questions about the service, or the process for getting your site onto the server. The way they treat a potential customer will give a good measure for how they'll respond once you are a customer., There are a variety of places online where people can post reviews about web hosting services. Check some of the more recent reviews for the company to see if people have had issues with customer service and support.


Be cautious – many web hosting review websites are operated by the hosting companies themselves, or people wanting to make a quick buck off of referrals. Always read the fine print, and ask someone you know who has experience working with web hosts who they prefer.
You may find reviews on the company's forums, but these could be curated by the company, with bad reviews getting deleted.

, Storage is the amount of space your website is given for all of its content. This includes your web pages, images, videos, databases, and anything else. If your website is not content-heavy, you likely will not need much space. The typical website is less than 100 MB in size, so you can usually ignore the claims of massive storage.


Lots of hosting companies will claim that you have unlimited space, but this is rarely necessary unless you are creating an incredibly content-rich website. In fact, this claim should be a red flag – unlimited space is a technical impossibility, and it could potentially mean that their servers may become overcrowded, thus decreasing server performance.
Give yourself room to grow. Make sure that you have room to expand and grow on the host you choose. It is recommended that you at least have the space to grow 20% within a year, so examine your needs and the storage solutions offered by the host. Some services will offer you more space as your needs expand.

, The bandwidth is the amount of data that is allowed to be transferred from your server to a visitor. Some services will offer unlimited bandwidth, while others will put a cap on the amount that you can transfer.


The amount of bandwidth you use will be determined by the amount of traffic you receive as well as the size of the content on your host. For example, a heavily-visited site with lots of pictures will take a lot more bandwidth than a heavily-visited site with mostly text.
""Unlimited bandwidth"" is rarely actually unlimited, and the trade-offs for services like these are often very noticeable. These hosts will typically be much slower than a host that applies bandwidth limits.
Make sure you know what will happen if you go over your bandwidth allotment. Depending on the hosting company, you may be charged extra or your website may be taken offline until the next billing period.

, The time it takes for the server to respond can make or break your website. The speed of the server often goes hand-in-hand with the bandwidth limits. If a server offers unlimited bandwidth, it will often put as many websites on the same server as possible, which can severely impact the speed. Find a few sites that are hosted by the company and test how long it takes pages to load.


Many hosting companies will show some of the more popular websites that they host as a means of advertisement. Use these to test the speed, but also know that this is not completely indicative of the speed your site will have.
You can ping websites to see how long it takes for packets to be sent and received from the server. This can give you a good idea about how quick the server is.

, Uptime is especially important for websites, especially if the website is business-related. Customers expect the service to be available 24/7. Many hosts will claim 99% or more, but be wary of any host that claims 100% uptime.The difference between 99% and 99.9% is three days out of the year. This is a very significant difference, as three days of down-time could cost you a lot of business.

, Ensure that the web host you choose has the tools and services that you need to best manage your site. This includes cPanel, WordPress or other blog integration, FTP access, analytics, and a variety of other back-end tools.


Check to ensure that the host allows you to configure an email address using the domain name that you register.

, The security of your web host is especially important if your are dealing with eCommerce and other forms of customer and user information.

, The industry standard is Linux, but if you are running a business that uses custom tools written with Microsoft .NET, you'll want to make sure you use a Windows server for greater compatibility.


For most people setting up their website for the first time, the operating system is largely irrelevant.
Windows Servers can be less secure than Linux servers., There are many companies that offer free web hosting, but the services offered are often severely limiting. Sites on free hosts will usually have ads on them that cannot be removed, and you typically can't set up ads for yourself.Free hosts are often much slower than a paid host. The benefits you gain for paying monthly will usually far outweigh the cost.

, When comparing paid packages, pay attention to the cost of additional features that you may not use. Web hosts love to bundle all kinds of services and products with their expensive packages, but they are usually only useful in very specific situations. Make sure that you're paying for reliability and customer service, and not useless add-ons.

, Customer service is one of the most crucial aspects when making your web hosting decision, but keep in mind that good customer service does not come cheap. When you're choosing among low-cost providers, the chances are that the customer service will not be stellar.

, Most web hosting services offer to take care of your domain name registration for an extra fee. You can almost always find the domain for cheaper through other domain registries. Save your money.

Post at the right time.",How to Increase Blog Traffic," The title of your blog is one of the first things that readers will see and one of the factors that search engines use to determine what your blog is about. The title of your blog should let readers know right away what your blog is about. It should be easy to remember, not too long, and not too similar to another website's name.


Keep this in mind when selecting a domain name as well. Oddly spelt words will throw people off, and make it more difficult for your blog to become memorable.;
, The first thing people notice when they visit your blog, is the way it looks. And although the old adage goes that one shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, the same isn’t always true for a blog. If you want people to stay on your blog, you’ve got to hook them with an eye-catching design; once they’re interested in the appearance, they’ll start reading to see what you’re all about.


Create a title/header that matches the theme and content of your blog. A clean, well designed header will tell readers a lot about your blog, and hopefully have them sticking around.
Keep your color scheme to a maximum of three hues. Too many colors can appear overwhelming, and distract readers from content. Choose at least one or two neutral colors, and one or two bright/bolder colors.
Create a small logo or image to represent your blog, if applicable. Having a ‘brand’ will make your blog memorable, and help others to recognize it when they see the logo around the internet.

, If you have a great design and content, you have to be sure to have great organization to match. If readers can’t find what they’re looking for easily, they’ll be much less likely to visit again in the future or to recommend your blog to others. Create a navigation bar at the top of the page or in a column, with links to common articles. Furthermore, set up a ‘tag’ system in which you can tag articles with keywords or phrases that will make it easier for readers to search.


If you’re coding-savvy enough, add a search bar to your blog. This will allow your readers to search from within your blog content without scrolling through pages of titles or links they’re not interested in.
Create general categories/links for your nav bar, with more specific sub-categories for each general link. This will make searching your blog easier.

, Although you likely want anyone and everyone to start reading your blog, typically only a specific target audience will make up the primary readership. Look at popular blogs that are similar to yours or how you want your to be, and emulate the ways in which they hook their audience on content. By creating specific, detailed content rather than general, vague content, your target audience will be more likely to become repeat readers, and to share your blog on a regular basis.


If you’re creating a fashion/beauty blog, make sure that the general appearance and content of your blog easily shows this.
If you’re covering a broad subject, consider writing multiple posts in order to get more detailed content about each part you’ll be discussing.

, People are visual, and they’re more likely to read an article or blog post if there are images to accompany it. If you’re a photographer or graphic designer, use your creative know-how to prepare images that fit the content of each individual blog post you create. If you’re not so artsy, use images from the web (with permission/linked sources) interspersed throughout your writing.


If you add your own images, add a small watermark with your blog’s name or URL on the bottom. That way, if your images get circulated around the web, people will see that they came from you and make a stop by your blog.
Write a small disclaimer on your blog that notes that people can share your images as much as they want, so long as they source them back to your article/home page.

, So now people are hooked on the appearance of your blog, but now you’ve got to provide stellar content to keep them around. In general, blogs should be written with a light-hearted tone and easy to understand vocabulary (unless it’s an academic or otherwise specific blog). Get your blog optimized for search engines (SEO optimized) by using common search queries throughout your writing. This will move your blog closer to the top of search engine result pages, and make people more likely to read your posts.


Always check your writing for proper grammar and spelling.
Avoid writing long paragraphs with no breaks. People have a hard time keeping their place on the page when reading block text, so break your writing into small sections, phrases, and short paragraphs.
Use a recognizable tone when you’re writing; readers gravitate towards someone whose writing is memorable and creative.

, When you’re full of inspiration or you have a lot to say, it can be easy to create blog posts, designs, images, and content that are overwhelming to viewers. Try to keep each individual post relatively short, breaking up broad topics into multiple, concise articles. Additionally, avoid having tons of contrasting ads, images, and links spread around the borders of your page.


Keep in mind that the longer it takes for your page to load, the lower on the search results page it will appear. Therefore, it is in your best interest to keep your posts relatively brief.
The old saying ‘less is more’ certainly applies to writing blogs.

, This can be difficult depending on the style of your blog, but if you focus on writing articles that aren’t ‘trendy’, you’ll likely have many more readers in the long run. If you’re writing about a fad, insert it into an article that will likely stay popular for more than a few months. In this way, you can almost guarantee future readership, especially if your page gets plenty of hits to start. Writing about things that are popular in the moment may give you a short burst of readers, but after a few weeks the number will likely dwindle significantly.


’What’s hot now’ articles are certainly appropriate in moderation, but if you want to have regular, consistent blog traffic, try to keep them to a minimum.
Writing for the future pertains mainly to blogs which are covering current trends, such as fashion, beauty, technology, and pop culture.

, If you have a stockpile of blog posts you’ve already published, don’t hesitate to give them a shout-out in your new posts! Readers will be drawn deeper into your blog with each link, and be more likely to stick around and explore a bit if you provide plenty of links to your other posts. Insert them inconspicuously into your writing by turning words or phrases in a sentence into colored hyperlinks that don’t detract/distract from the rest of your content., If you have great content but only post once a month, even the most loyal followers will eventually get burnt out on waiting for an update from you. Try to set up a regular blogging schedule, so that you’re posting at least once a week. Keep in mind, the more you post, the more chances you have to get readers.


Avoid the pitfall of posting even when you don’t have quality content. It’s ok to go a little extra time between posts if it means building up for writing that is more meaningful.

, Possibly the most effective way to promote readership outside your friends and family is to promote your blog on social media. Although it can be difficult to manage multiple accounts, if you’re able to juggle your presence between a few different sites, you’ll likely notice a significant increase in viewers. Consider using social media platforms such as:


Facebook
Twitter
Pinterest
Instagram
Reddit
LinkedIn
Google+
Tumblr

, If you’re an avid reader of other blogs in your genre, you’ve probably noticed that people will comment with links to their own blogs at the end of popular posts. Commenting alone is a great way to get your name and ideas out in the world, but if you’re able to add a link to your blog as well, you’ll likely grab a few attentive readers. This is good, because the people who click through to your blog are likely some of the most loyal, possibly gaining you a solid following.


Add creative, insightful comments to blog posts. Writing meager, boring, or irrelevant comments and linking to your blog will drive people away.
Comment often and on a variety of different blogs. After a while, the authors of the blogs you comment on will begin to take notice and might contact you for collaborations.

, If you’re able to link up with a fellow blogger in your community, contact them to guest blog on your site. They’ll post the link to your site on theirs, bringing in a whole slew of new readers who otherwise might not have discovered you. Further, they might return the favor and ask you to guest blog for them. Before you decide to ask someone to be featured on your blog, create a rubric or set of questions you plan on asking them. Having a blog post outlined for them will make them much more likely to accept your offer.


If you’re good friends with another blogger, consider simply offering to do a guest post on their blog. They might happily give you free reign to create something for them.
Interview-style guest posts are typically the easiest, but if you’re clear about what you’re looking for, another blogger may be able to generate entirely new content for you.

, You’ve probably done this yourself - found a blog you love, forget to write down the URL, and never visit again. Don’t allow this to happen to your readers! On your own blog, you can create an email newsletter or update system to let readers know when you’ve created a new post. Want an easier way to do it? Join a program like Bloglovin.com; this site allows other users to ‘follow’ you, and receive an alert every time you post something new.


Rather than creating a newsletter that is sent out with every blog post, think about having a monthly update to send to viewers who comment or subscribe. This way, you don’t bog your readers down with unwanted emails or messages., Many blogs create a column for ads solely from other bloggers in their genre. Start a space on your blog where other blogs can post an advertisement; they’ll likely link to your page as well. Do the opposite too; look for free or cheap monthly ad spaces through other blogs. In the end, you both end up with more readers, so it’s a win-win situation.


If you’ve never had ads on your blog before, consider having a ‘first month free!’ type deal in order to draw in other bloggers.
The more popular a blog is, the more it will cost to host an ad. Start small and work your way up to larger blogs as you gain popularity.
You can pay to have your blog advertised on other popular sites, but this can be very expensive and not the best option for beginning bloggers.

, Sometimes when you read other blogs, you’ll notice they give a shout-out to a blog post or blog author they admire. When this is done, the author being recognized will typically repost the original in which they were cited, as a sort of badge of honor. If you are truly inspired by a particular person or blog, link to it on your own blog, and send an email or comment to the author. They’ll be flattered you noticed them, and if nothing else you’ll have at least one new follower.


Consider compiling a list of your favorite blogs, and linking to them. This increases the chances of the authors mentioning you and your list on their own blog.
If you don’t feel comfortable publicly posting about a blog you like, try contacting the author and telling them privately. They’ll still appreciate your contact, and will probably start reading your blog too.

, If your target audience is adult males over the age of 50, it probably won’t be good to always post new content at midnight. Similarly, it’s not incredibly helpful if you post about how to make the perfect ‘New Year’s Eve’ decorations for a party, the day of/after New Year’s Eve. Keep your target audience and your content in mind when you choose a date and time to post an update.


Posts that relate to a specific date should be planned several weeks in advance. This will give readers plenty of time to stumble upon your post, before the date has arrived.
If you post on a regular basis, try to post at the same time each day. This way, followers of your blog will know around what time to expect an update from you, and can hop over to your blog without a reminder that you’ve updated it."
"
Post to Facebook.,
Post your images to Pinterest.,
Use StumbleUpon.,
Use Google+.,
Link your posts in popular aggregate sites.,
Create an RSS feed.",How to Promote Your Blog2," When you publish a blog article, link to it from your Facebook account to keep your friends and family in the loop. These people may not seem as important for your long-term readership, but who they share it with can have a large impact on your readership.


As your blog grows in popularity, you will most likely see an increase in your Facebook activity, as readers and other bloggers add you as a Facebook friend.

, If you have an image-oriented blog, post the images to PInterest in order to drive your traffic up. Pinterest is very focused on images, so this won’t be as useful if you have text only.

, Submit your blog posts to StumbleUpon to add them to the bookmark service. Make sure that you tag your article with appropriate tags so that it appears for the right viewers.

, This service may not be as popular as Facebook or Twitter, but because it is run by Google you will get bonuses to your Google search engine ratings when you are linked through Google+. Blog posts on Google+ can also be rapidly shared with a wide variety of people.

, Websites such as Digg and Reddit have millions of active users, and are a great way to spread the word about your blog. If the users like your work, they will do the promotion work for you by voting up your site and commenting on it.

, An RSS feed will automatically push your blog posts to subscribers, and they can access your posts through reader programs. This is a great way to make sure that your subscribers stay as up-to-date as possible.

Find similar blogs.,
Comment often.",How to Promote Your Blog3," Look for blogs in your niche that have a high readership. Post thoughtful and informative responses to other authors and commenters. Avoid spamming links to your blog, and don’t just fill the comment box with search engine keywords. Instead, interact and be genuine; this will drive like-minded readers to find your blog.

, Become a part of the community. The more you make a name for yourself on others’ blogs, the more traffic you will drive to your site. You can also catch the eye of other, more successful bloggers who may link to your posts and even collaborate on projects.

"
"
Avoid overuse of keywords.,
Review your Google Analytics.,
Design content around what your readers are searching for.,
Use SEO smartly.",How to Promote Your Blog4," A simple trap that many bloggers fall into is overloading their writing with keywords. This will lead to fake-sounding content and will actually provide little in the way of extra traffic. This is because as soon as a reader clicks your link and sees a jumbled mess of keywords, they’ll most likely leave immediately.

, This tool will show you what search words are driving people to your site, as well as popular searches on the web. You can also see how long users stay on your page, which is an essential tool for determining how worthy they find your content.

, Use Analytics to see what your readers are searching for on the web. Use these results to tailor articles specifically towards your readers’ interests.

, Instead of placing keywords all over your article, focus them in the places where they matter most.


Make sure that your Title tag has relevant keywords, as this is the part of your blog that is given the most weight in search engine results.
Write a powerful title. The title of your blog post is the second-most important aspect of your blog when determining search engine placement. Anything in the ""H1"" heading is given more weight in search engine results.
Optimize your content, but don’t overdo it. Good content will be much more valuable than a collection of keywords. Make sure that your post is well thought out and informative first, and then optimize it for the keywords that suit your content best.

Create a mailing list.,
Send out a newsletter.,
Pitch your blog.",How to Promote Your Blog5," Email is often overlooked with the advent of social media, but the fact of the matter is that almost everyone still uses email on a daily basis. Creating a mailing list will help you connect with your most passionate readers.

, Use a newsletter to keep your subscribers up to date with happenings on your blog. Include quick summaries of your posts with links to the full article. A newsletter is a great way to keep less active readers engaged in your articles.

, Use email to send a blog post you’re particularly proud of to friends, other bloggers, and the mainstream press. Avoid sending email updates for every post you make, but do this occasionally to increase your reach. If the post is especially good, other bloggers may link it in their posts, which can drive lots of traffic to your blog.

Network daily.,
Write a daily plan.,
Make personal contact.",How to Promote Your Blog6," Even if you aren’t posting a blog update, you should be actively involved in your blogging community. Every minute that you’re not promoting yourself is another minute without new readers.

, Come up with a plan of action for each day. Make sure you have attainable goals, such as write two pages of content and find three blogs in your niche. You may not always meet your goals for the day, but striving towards them will keep you active in the blogging community and ensure that your blog is always growing.

, Try to make direct contact with other bloggers and readers. Shoot for making 100 connections per day. This will keep you focused on networking and building your community. You may not actually achieve 100 connections, but trying every day will dramatically increase your network.

Weigh factors that affect price and value when choosing a domain name.,
Consider going through an ICANN-accredited domain name registrar.,
Make sure you can control every aspect of your domain name.,
Check to see if there’s a fee associated with releasing or transferring your domain.,
Check to see if you get any email accounts.,
Make sure you can use their SMTP servers for outgoing email.,
Make sure you always retain control of your domain name.,
Never register your domain in anyone else’s name.",How to Buy a Cheap Domain Name1," A great domain name is simple, unique, and easy to remember. That being said, the price (not to mention the intrinsic value) of a domain name depends on many factors including overall length, number of words, ease of spelling, and how much traffic goes there without prompting.


A short, one-word name (ex. cat.com), and especially .com domains, will be pricy because simple titles have a lot of potential uses, meaning people probably already check them out on their own. If you are going after a registered .com domain, you will have to contact the current owner, and even then, prices could be high for misspellings and multiple word domains. In the past years, companies and individuals have settled for bizarre names, misspellings, and old tricks like adding “the” or “my” to the front; note, however, that this will also reduce domain performance.
Since 2014, new domain extensions (top-level domains, or TLDs) have been released as alternatives to .com, .org, etc. There are hundreds of such extensions that continue to be released, which include .club, .guru, .design, and many others, and they have effectively relieved the issue of scarcity in .com domains.
Before you allow yourself to completely fall in love with a domain name, create a few variants and backups.
If your desired name contains an intentional misspelling, be prepared to lose traffic to the properly spelled version. Alternatively, if your name contains a commonly misspelled word, consider buying one variation (or more) on your domain name and redirecting it to your main site. Of course, this will cause additional expenses.
Avoid including characters (ex. _, *, #) in your name, as these aren’t intuitive and will divert traffic.;
, An ICANN-accredited company has to go through all the ICANN accreditation checks, which is an expensive, in-depth process. This lets you know the company is committed.

, Many domain name registration companies don’t let you make changes to your domains yourself. You have to enter a request via their support systems and then wait days for assistance. Simple things like changing IPS tags and changing name servers should be possible via your control panel. Make sure you get a control panel and check out what the control panel lets you do.

, Many domain name registration and hosting companies charge a release fee. Others will charge a transfer fee every time you change hosts (.com, .net, .biz etc.). This charge is completely unnecessary; you should never be held to ransom over your domain name.

, Many web hosting companies don’t include email or charge extra for it. In many cases, you can only get email forwarding. Even for straightforward POP3 email, some companies only offer 1 or 2 email accounts. You should make sure you get at least 15-20 POP3 email accounts included free of charge with your domain.

, Many hosting and domain name registration providers will not let you use their SMTP servers for sending emails. They assume you can send email via your internet server provider’s SMTP servers. However, a great many ISPs and broadband providers will only let you use their SMTP servers on their branded email accounts (i.e. davesmith_123@theirISP.net). This means that if you use your own email address (i.e. dave.smith@davesmith.net), you won’t be able to send email via their SMTP servers. There are workarounds but you shouldn’t have to go to the trouble.


Watch out: there are a number of the top hosting companies that will only let you use their SMTP servers on premium email accounts which incur an extra charge.

, There are hundreds of businesses hosting their websites with a web host they’re not happy with. Poor service, surprise invoices, unreliable uptime and email issues are just some of the common issues customers are facing today. What most of them want to do is vote with their feet and walk out the door and find another web hosting provider. They don’t go through with it, however, because moving all their domains to another host is a complete admin headache. Choose wisely from the get-go so you don’t become one of these customers.

, Your webmaster or kid cousin might be more tech-savvy than you, but if the domain ends up registered in his/her name, you may lose your site overnight should (s)he neglect to renew it on time or have a falling out with you.

When advertising your forum, you may want to put the advertisement in the form of a mondo, eye-catching banner.;
, Visitors will be more obliged to join a forum that is well-combed. Try getting a good skin, good images, good smiles, and think up some good topics. If you can, try to put some features on your forum that aren't common on some of the more popular ones.

, Have them advertise it on other forums/websites and have them refer to good friends about the forum. You shouldn't force them to do so, but if they are loyal to your forum and want to see it grow, they'll be happy to oblige.

, If any member feels left out or is being mistreated, then they're most likely going to leave. Not only did you just lose a member, but you probably lost the member's ability to promote your forum.

, Visitors don't like to join dying forums, so be sure you can post something every day or so. If you're presenting something new every now and then, your current members will probably follow.

, This is where you create multiple accounts yourself and use them all so it seems like your forum is active, drawing in new members. Use this trick only if you are desperate. But remember, you will have to keep going into your other accounts to keep the secret hidden. If you made like 10 accounts, people will realize something is up.

Research a few companies before deciding which one to go through.,
Check to see if your desired name is taken.,
Choose and pay for a domain.,
Never forget to pay your renewal fee on time or you will lose your site overnight.",How to Buy a Cheap Domain Name2," Price, amount of control, ease of use, level customer service, and whatever else they may have to offer you can differ widely between companies.

, The company you decide to register through will allow you to search a database to find out whether or not your domain name is taken. If it is, proceed with the following steps; if not, either think of a new name or see the section below.


Don’t assume a name is available just because you typed it in the address bar and didn’t get a hit. Sites that haven’t yet been uploaded or are undergoing major repairs can sometimes produce false negatives.

, To get and keep a domain, you will usually have to pay a purchase fee, a yearly renewal fee, and possibly a setup fee.

, This will be particularly embarrassing if your domain is bought out by an unsavory business that shocks your old visitors.

"
Find out who owns the domain.,
Contact the owner.,
Negotiate a price.,
Be extremely cautious while communicating with the owner.,
Get the owner to agree as soon as possible.",How to Buy a Cheap Domain Name3," If it’s a major operator with a well-established site, just bow out gracefully. However, you might get lucky and find that the domain was purchased on a whim, as a backup, or without careful consideration, in which case you may be able to negotiate a deal.

, Before so much as hinting at a price, simply email to ask whether or not the domain is for sale. If you are known or can clearly be linked to a thriving business, create a generic alternate email address through which to contact them, as your success might be leveraged against you. Be aware, however, that an informal-sounding email address is more likely to be regarded as spam or junk mail.

, According to internet entrepreneur James Siminoff, there are four basic haggling scenarios:


The owner suggests an unreasonable amount. If this is the case, counter with what you think is fair instead of low-balling it. It’s no secret that domain names are valuable real estate, so your underwhelming offer is unlikely to make the owner take you seriously.
The owner asks you to suggest a price. If this is the case, they want to sell and are likely to try to negotiate up. Suggest 20 to 30% below your bottom range and let the haggling begin.
The owner asks for less than you’d prefer. Accept, but not too enthusiastically, or they might begin to suspect they’re being too generous.
The owner suggests exactly the price you’d prefer. See above.

, Even if you casually agree to buy the domain via email, the communication might be used against you in court as a legally-binding contract should you change your mind. Until you’re absolutely certain that you want to make a deal, agree to buy the domain provided that all the terms are agreeable. This will leave you an escape hatch if things go south.

, If the owner out-and-out agrees to your price, the email becomes an enforceable contract.

This provides a free form of advertising that helps to build a portfolio, which you will need later on.

Track your potential influencers.,
Join the influencers community.,
Mention and repost the works of relevant influencers.,
Invite the influencers to blog.",How to Get Influencers to Promote Your Blog," To get started, you'll need to search for influencers in your niche. Here, social media can easily help you identify and keep tabs on key persons that have a considerably large following. On forums and sites like Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook, search for those who actively participate in discussions that are related to your industry.

You can also get information from your own followers by finding out what blogs they visit and who they follow online.;
, Participating in the influencer's online community that includes influencers on its list of members is an effective way to be visible to them. Maximize your online presence by commenting on their posts, raising interesting questions, and joining discussions about relevant topics that stand out. Take advantage of these public post functions to be noticed by the influencers who can even feature you in return., Acknowledge their contributions in your industry by tagging or mentioning them in your social media platforms or by featuring them on your blog posts. This can help to gain their attention. It may even persuade them to share more of your blog posts online in return. Aside from getting a wider exposure, this opens up an opportunity for you to establish and cultivate a genuine online relationship with influencers., Once you've established a professional relationship with an influencer or two, you can perhaps ask them to contribute to your blog. This can maximize your online presence, providing you with the opportunity to reach their followers. Having influencers publish content on your blog also helps strengthen your credibility as a blogger in your industry, which can invite more readers."

Verify that you can contact the domain owner.,
Ask the owner if the domain is for sale.,
Negotiate a sale price for the domain.",How to Buy a Premium Domain2," If you cannot effectively reach the owner of the domain, you will not have the opportunity to buy the domain from them.


Use the contact information published on the domain to contact the owner. In some cases, you may need to review the cached versions of certain web pages to locate contact information.
Click on a link within your domain that reads similarly to ""this domain may be for sale."" In most cases, these links will redirect you to the contact information for the owner of the website.
Use the ""who is"" directory to find contact information for a domain or to send a private message to the domain owner. A ""who is"" directory can be found on the ""Domain Tools"" website, the link to which is featured on the ""Four Hour Workweek"" website listed in this article's Sources section.

, This will allow you to confirm whether buying the domain is an option.


Refrain from giving the domain owner your personal information when you inquire whether or not the domain is for sale. If the owner has your personal information, they may research your background to see how much you are worth. For example, if you own a highly profitable business, the domain owner may charge you more than they may charge others for the domain.
Create an email address using an alias if you need to contact the domain owner by email.

, If the owner is selling the domain, they may have a certain price range established for which they will sell their premium domain.


Use verbiage that allows for flexibility from a legal standpoint when negotiating the price of the domain in writing. For example, if you communicate in writing that you will buy the domain for 20,000 dollars (15,819 euros), you may be bound to that sale price by contract and may not have the ability to negotiate for a lower sale price.

"
"
Buy the domain from a reputable Internet domain registrar.,
Provide the domain registrar with your valid contact information.,
Pay for your premium domain.",How to Buy a Premium Domain3," Buying and registering the domain yourself will prevent web development or web design companies from owning your domain from a legal standpoint.


Verify that the domain registrar has legitimate contact information. This will allow you to work directly with the registrar if issues ever occur with your domain.
Review the terms and conditions of the domain registrar to verify whether they have professional legitimate business practices, and to verify the steps for renewing the domain or transferring the domain to a different registrar in the future.

, This will allow the registrar to contact you if any issues occur in regards to your domain.

, In most cases, buying a domain directly from an Internet domain registrar will cost between 5 and 12 dollars (3.95 and 9.49 euros) per year.


Add a privacy feature to your domain package, if available. Adding privacy to your package will prevent your personal information and contact information from being published publicly on the domain registrar's website. In most cases, the privacy feature costs an additional 1 or 2 dollars (0.79 or 1.58 euros) per domain.

Utilize conventional advertising media to get the word out about your business.,
Harness the power of the Internet.,
Work with local schools, businesses, churches, hotels and non-profit organizations.,
Set up accounts on social networking sites.,
Stir up some word of mouth.",How to Get Free Advertising,"


A press release can go a long way, if you word it properly and send it to the right contacts. Call local newspapers, magazines, radio stations and TV stations and ask who exactly you should send your release to. Make it newsworthy, though, and don't make it sound like a sales pitch.
Do interviews when you can. Contact local reporters when you're having special events or doing charity work and get some free coverage about the event and your business. This works well with all types of traditional media sources.;
, You can put a free listing of your business on most search engines, many of which have maps to help people find you. Make use of keywords when you're writing content for your own website as this will help you get ranked higher in search engine results. You could also try a quid pro quo with other local businesses: You put your ad on their website in exchange for them putting your ad on theirs. At the very least, you could exchange links to each others' sites.

, By supporting your community, they might support you. You can achieve this by offering a discount or doing some cross-promotion. You will drum up some word of mouth this way as well. You could also offer to speak to different groups about your business or a mutual interest. Career days and job fairs may also glean you some free advertising.

, These are all free and you can attract attention from different demographics depending on what sites you use. Facebook, Myspace and Twitter are geared toward younger generations while LinkedIn targets professionals. There are niche sites out there as well; find one that suits your business and sign up for a new way to gain some free publicity.


Online communities and blogs can serve the same purpose. By creating a profile page and posting on forums, people can benefit from your expertise while finding out more about your product. Blogging is also effective at getting your message out while giving consumers some information that may help them.

, By giving referral discounts to customers who do business with you, they will likely tell their friends to patronize your store. Giving away free items or deep discounts will also create a buzz. Hand out your business card to everyone you come in contact with and always deliver the product you promise. The best free advertising stems from a product or service that is high in quality and delivered reliably.

Vary your sentences.,
Use apostrophes correctly.,
Affect or effect?,
Capitalize proper nouns.,
I or me?,
Proofread.",How to Make Sure Your Blog Uses Correct Grammar," Don't always use short sentences or complex sentences; using a variety of sentence structures will make your posts more interesting to read.;
, Apostrophes are used for contraction and possession. An example of apostrophes used in contraction is what's (what is). An example of apostrophes used to indicate possession of something is, Hannah's book was a birthday gift. (i.e. Hannah owns--or possesses--the book.)


One important caveat: do not use an apostrophe to indicate possession with the pronoun ""it."" For example, the sentence, Hannah thought it's cover art was amazing. is wrong. It's is a contraction of it and is. Since, in the example, the cover art belonged to ""it,"" the sentence, when grammatically correct, would be Hannah thought its cover art was amazing.







, This is a common mistake. Remember, an effect is the result of something, while to be affected by something is an event,item, etc., on you. A side effect affects you.

, Never use a proper noun without its first letter capitalized (e.g. Rolling Stone magazine, not rolling stone magazine).

, When writing a sentence that mentions more than one person, it can get confusing whether to use I or me. In situations like this, omit the other person and read the sentence in the singular voice. For example, Amy and I were scared. is correct because if Amy were removed from the sentence and read it in the singular voice, I was scared sounds more correct than 'Me was scared.

, Reread it at least once, keeping a vigilant eye for typos and other errors.

Google your website.,
Make sure the info is organised.,
Titles are important.,
Advertising.,
Be informed.,
Be consistent.",How to Get Free Website Views," Go to your website by finding it on google, or entering the HTML and look over your site. Make sure that the overall design of the website is good. ( the font should be dark and the background should be light colour). The reason it should look good, neat and organised is because it will attract the reader's attention, but if it is too bright (orange font and light green background) the readers eyes will hurt and they will not want to stay;
, Paragraphs and pictures make the website organized and it looks good. Make sure you stay on topic.

, One thing that a lot of people who start a website do wrong, is that they do not write the correct title. If you are making a website about how to repair a certain part of a car, do not make the title something long and confusing like ""repairing the silver part near the middle of the car, because it is rusted"". This will be hard to find on google and the reader will be confused. Write something clear and short like ""repairing a car's motor""

, In order to get more views on your site, you must advertise it. In order to get free views, you must do your research and find out ways to advertise for free. You should consider making an account on Wiki how and advertising the website on your profile, recommending it on the forums, or writing articles about cars, so people know you are knowledgeable and they will see your website. Also check out ""free advertising"" on google and look at the results.

, If you are willing to spend some money into advertising your website, you should look for 1) Where it will be advertised 2) Is there a time period? 3) What time it will be advertised 4) How much it will cost and 5) Are there cheaper alternatives?

, DO not advertise for one day and let it go. Try advertising for a week, and spread the message. Tell your friends too and the word will spread.

Being aware of what it takes to start a successful blog can help you find success.It can be a good idea to keep a stable source of income while you build your blog.
It will take time to build up the content on your blog.
Attracting advertising partners will require you to build up the number of readers your blog has.;
, Most blogs will have a specific topic that they focus on. Having a focus can help readers know what to expect and can also help you create more detailed posts. Although you could have a general blog that covers whatever topics you feel like writing about, you may want to consider finding one topic that you love to blog about.


You might want to have multiple blogs that cover single topics.
You could have one blog that covers many topics.
One example of a single topic blog is http://www.nerdfitness.com/


http://dooce.com/ is an example of a blog that covers multiple topics.

, Once you are ready to start your blog, you'll need to begin creating content. Your content will be the main part of what will draw readers in and keep them there. If your content is lacking in quality, depth or interest, readers won't be as likely to stick around. Always try to keep your content at its best to help engage readers and increase the popularity of your blog.Consider blogging about a specific area of knowledge or a skill set that you can share.Make sure your posts are informative, educational, and entertaining.
Longer content usually gets more readers.
Make sure your posts are written properly, using correct grammar and punctuation.
Keep your audience in mind when considering what writing tone to use.
If you sell a product or service, try using your blog posts to direct your readers to them.

, Simply creating a stylish blog and great content isn't enough to succeed in blogging. You'll need to attract regular readers and a good way to find them is by actively promoting your blog. You'll want to inform and reach as many potential readers as you can to increase traffic and start earning money.Try hosting a webinar to gain readers and generate extra income.
Don't worry too much about creating social media accounts at first. These will be more important once you've grown a large reader base.
Guest writing for another blog can be a good way to bring readers to your own.
Get involved with other blogging communities and websites to promote your own blog.
Know how to use tags properly for search engine optimization. For example, a blog about cars might use the tags ""Car blog, auto restoration, custom cars""., Thanks to modern technology and social media, connecting with others has never been easier. You can use these mediums to instantly inform your followers of any updates or changes that you make to your blog. Your fans will also help build your blog by sharing your content with other people they know. Although social media isn't extremely important at the start of your blog, you'll still want to get familiar with some of the basic applications of it as your blog grows.You'll want to learn which social media platforms most of your target audience uses. For example, a blog about crafts might be promoted on Pintrest.
Consider the amount of traffic social media platforms get on average. Facebook and Twitter are some of the most active sites.
It can be helpful to set your blog up to auto-share your new posts and content.
Learn the best methods of sharing on your selected social media platforms. For example, knowing which #'s to use on Twitter can be a big help when sharing your posts.

, One way you can get more readers is by contacting other bloggers. You'll want to find other influential bloggers in your field, make contact, build a relationship and begin sharing content. Having a well-respected blogger vouch for your content can bring a huge amount of interest and readers your way. Try taking these steps to work with other bloggers:Find influential blogs that cover similar topics you do.
Get involved in other blogs. Write comments, be helpful and share the blog with others.
Contact the writer of the blog directly once you've been noticed.
Ask them to check out your blog or offer examples of your content to get a spot as a guest writer.
Continue building your relationship and sharing readers with one another.

, Although you can work from anywhere you have an Internet connection, you will still need to work hard. Creating a successful blog will take a lot of time, effort and dedication. Keep in mind, you won't just be writing blog posts. You'll be spending an equal amount of time building contacts, promoting your site, and managing your community. Although being a blogger can be a lot of fun and provide a convenient way to earn a living, you'll still need to work hard at it in order to find success.It's recommended that you spend as much time creating content as you do networking and promoting your blog.
You will need to be highly self-motivated.
You'll likely spend a lot of time responding to comments and interacting with your readers.

, Many blogs will sell space on their website to ad services. These services will place advertisements on your website and will pay you for either renting the ad space or by how much exposure the ad gets. These ad services can be a great way to passively generate income as people read your blog.Ad services may pay based on how many people see or click an ad.
Some ad services may pay a flat rate based on the traffic your website receives.
Chances are that ad revenue will be cumulative, rather than selling one big advertisement.

",How to Make a Massie Block Roleplaying Blog," Don't use Weebly, Webs, or any of those web-making sites. You need a blog! Wordpress is a great website to use.;
, Pick a cute background and a header. Add widgets, too! Be creative with your blog and don't be an Apple C-er!

, The essentials are an About Me/Massie, where you tell all about Massie, a Current State of The Union page, a Massie-quin page, to post all of Massie's adorable outfits, a Pretty Committee page, to post everyone in your PC. Be original and creative and add your own pages too, like a House page where you post pictures of your house, a Beauty/Fashion advice page, or a Profile page where you list TPC's profiles.

, Some bloggers like their Massie to be in London, like when she moved there in the last Clique book. Some bloggers moved their Massies back to Westchester. Others like their Massie's still 12-13, while many like theirs in high school. Be creative with it! Creativity is key.

, It can be an introduction post or a real post.

, This is very important because it will get you known. You can't have 1,000 views in a snap of your fingers, girls! Always comment NICE things on other's blogs, never gossip on a public blog, that's what AIM is for. Commenting also helps you make friends with other bloggers, and maybe they can give you shout-outs.

, (Claire is optional, since she arrived in TPC in the 3rd book, but she's recommended.) You can't just be a Massie with no PC, right? Hold auditions/applications for the other characters and just wait until someone applies. You can also apply on other character's blogs. Never, ever, apply to a blog that already has a Massie unless they say they're okay with having 2 or more PCs. That's just rude and will seem that you're trying to steal their PC away, also it'll make you seem like a desperate EW.

, Talk to them, e-mail them, AIM chat with them. They will become friends with you and can help you on suggestions for your blog or any problems with it. Never tell anyone huge secrets, if they get mad at you they WILL tell other people!

, Never copy though without permission and giving credit!

, A face-claim is when you use a person's pictures to describe what your character looks like. Elizabeth McLaughlin and Sarah Hyland are 2 good examples for face-claims for Massie.

, Don't just have your Pretty Committee and the guys in your posts! Add background characters like Layne and Nina Callas, and make your own characters up, you can even add a new girl to your Pretty Committee.

, You don't want to cast any shadows on yourself, so you should have a light behind you, and one on either side of you. You don't necessarily have to have huge studio lights, but lamps and a window would work.

, When you're not vlogging in public or around the house, you should have a setting you can always use. For something a little interesting, look at Ray William Johnson's or Black Nerd Comedy's backgrounds. For a plain, solid-color background, look at iJustine's background.


Choosing a background isn't right or wrong. There's an appeal with a unique background because it catches the attention of the viewer, but also with a plain background, because the viewer only listens to you, and isn't starting everywhere else.

, Don't steal ideas from popular YouTubers, or anyone for that matter. Have fun, and think of what you're going to say.

, When you get on camera, don't stutter or think up something on the spot.

, Buy editing software or use iMovie or Windows Live Movie Maker. If you don't edit, you'll lose the professional feel of your video. You can look up plenty of tutorials on using your software.

, Write about yourself and your video. If your first video is called MY FIRST VIDEO, don't say it's your first video in your description, because everybody will know, and that's obnoxious.

, If you were vlogging in public and your camera was shaky, click on stabilise. If your lighting wasn't as good as you'd hoped, pick a lighting filter.

",How to Make a Blog Layout," 68% of internet users have a screen resolution of either 1024x768, 1280x800, or 1280x1024, so obviously people are using larger monitors. You can take advantage of larger screen resolutions by using a center layout. Just design an adjustable layout so your blog is viewable on smaller screen resolutions. Visitors hate to scroll horizontally.;
, Pick either a two column or three column layout. Make sure your content column isn't too wide. Thinner content columns make for easier reading.

, Tests show the best column for the blog post content is in the center. Visitors look for menu items and other action items in the left and right columns.

, Examples: Social bookmarks, forms, blogrolls, categories, etc.

, Use a free split tester at Adwords.Google.com. Use the a/b tester if you are just starting your blog. It lets you test entirely different layouts and is meant for lower traffic blog pages.

Compare the various types of micro-bloggers.",How to Learn About Micro Blogging," The definitions are as follows:


Blog - (short for weblog) is a personal online journal that is frequently updated and intended for general public consumption.
Micro Blog - a form of multimedia blogging that allows users to send brief text updates or micromedia such as photos or audio clips and publish them. Some micro-blogging platform have limits as to the maximum number of characters per post. Twitter for example limits you to 140 characters per tweet. Because of this limitation, many long URLs in posts are shorten using URL shorteners such as bit.ly.

Both bloggers and micro-bloggers have a variety of third party software or plug-ins for their browsers to simplify the process.

;
, There are a number of clients that will allow you to post quick updates from your smart phone, mobile device, or desktop. These clients also will help you to keep track of activity throughout the day, since a big part of micro-blogging is interaction and re-posting others' content. Texting is one easy way to micro-blog throughout the day if you're not near a computer. You can also keep a desktop client running in the background throughout the day and set up notifications to let you know when someone has mentioned you or re-blogged your content.

, The most successful micro-bloggers post regular content (usually a few posts a day) with some common theme or link. These bloggers are also active in re-blogging content and participating in the micro-blogging community. Traditional blogging is a much better format if you only have time to blog once a week, but you can integrate your blogging and micro-blogging with some practice.

, Some content works very well in the micro-blog format, for example quick personal updates or thoughts, brief opinion statements, links to blog posts or news you found interesting, quick reactions to news, and event information. Those who blog regularly already may find that micro-blogging provides a great alternative to link spams or short posts whose entire point is really to highlight someone else's work.

Customize your settings.,
Upload your content.",How to Build a Professional Looking Website For Free1," Before you sit down to create your page, get a feel for the kind of site you want to have. This will enable you to have a clear image of what you want when selecting a platform.


The sky is the limit for site potential, but common ideas include blogs (lifestyle, humor, artwork, and so on), photo galleries, news sources, tutorials, or any combination thereof.;
, Once you know what you want your site to be about, find a relevant platform. WordPress and Tumblr are two of the most widely-used platforms for free websites, with WordPress powering over 65% of all websites on the Internet for both small and large companies to meet most general requirements.


Some platforms, like Tumblr, specialize in visual content; others, like WordPress, are more writing-centric.
Some platforms allow you to create a custom .com URL for free, but most free platforms require their name to come before the "".com"" (for example, www.yourwebsite.yourplatform.com).
Tech-savvy users may prefer platforms such as Joomla and Drupal for their customization capabilities, but most prefer easy-to-use platforms like WordPress.

, Most platforms will require you to log in with an email address and a password. Make sure you select an active email account so that you don't miss any updates.


Most platforms will send you a confirmation email; depending on your email provider, this email may be in your spam folder. Click the confirm button in the email to lock in your account.

, After you've created your account, it's time to pick a theme. Your theme determines aspects of your site such as layout, persuasion--for example, photo- or script-oriented--and the general aesthetic of your website. Choose a theme that best reflects your content intentions.


For example, a minimalist theme with a heavy emphasis on visual media is great for a photo portfolio, whereas a visually-stunning text-only theme works well as a news source.

, After you've chosen your basic theme, you can tailor certain aspects such as font, the color of the writing, and the heading to your liking. If your platform allows it, you can also determine the URL of your site and similar mechanics.


If you're tech-savvy enough, most sites will allow you to access basic HTML editing for extensive customization purposes.

, Once your site is customized to your liking, it's time to start fleshing it out with content. Most professional sites go for a balance of written content and visual media, so be creative!

, Open an internet browser of your choice and search for free versions of WYSIWYG software; Wix, Weebly, and Jimdo are all excellent choices, but it's important that you pick an editor that suits your purposes. Programs like these often give you the ability to create entire templates from scratch; if you want to design your site's detailing from the ground up, this is how you do it.

, You will likely have to sign in with an email address and choose a password, so be sure to write both down. It's a good idea to choose an email address you actively use so that you don't miss updates.


Check your email for a confirmation note from the site of your choice; most sites such as these require you to confirm your email as active before allowing you access.

, Each WYSIWYG editor will have different criteria for beginners, so read through their terms and instructions if need be. Your main focus should be on creating your template; this will serve as the base for all your content.


If the editor you chose proves to be too advanced for your purposes, consider accessing their tutorials or simply using a different editor. You can always come back later!
Most WYSIWYG sites have a ton of free templates, so feel free to start with one of them and expand from there.

, If you don't want to build your site from the ground up, look for free template galleries; several open-source sites cater to this specific market, with Wix in particular providing premium-grade photography templates for free. , Once you've created your templates and customized the site to your liking, it's time to start adding content.

Decide on the type of site you want to make.,
Choose your language.,
Begin the learning process.,
Be patient.",How to Build a Professional Looking Website For Free3," Coding is intimidating to begin learning but the truth is that there are more free resources than ever to help you get started. First you'll need to consider the type of site you are aiming to build. This will determine the type of coding you have to use; for example, flash visual-heavy sites tend to emphasize JavaScript, whereas a script-based site might utilize HTML.

, Some common web design languages include HTML and CSS, Java, and Python.


HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) tend to go hand-in-hand: HTML is responsible for creating the core structure of any basic webpage, while CSS dictates aspects of the webpage like theme, color, and layout. Both are fairly basic programs, and thus are recommended for beginners. Python and Java are higher-level codes used by advanced programmers to create dynamic sites. Both are well-suited to high-traffic sites such as Amazon or Yahoo Maps.

, There are a ton of sites that will teach you entry-level coding for free. GitHub, CodeAcademy, Khan Academy, and Code Avengers all offer unique and interactive ways to learn HTML and CSS webpage coding. These resources are all easily accessed, and should be more than sufficient for most webpage coding needs. If you're interested in more advanced coding literature, MIT Open Courseware, edX, and Google University Consortium both offer free courses in Java and Python. , Focus on learning your language of choice and make it a priority, but don't expect to learn an entire language over night--this will take time! While knowing how to code basic webpages and templates is the end goal, keep in mind the fact that webpage coding is a marketable skill; thus, you should absolutely consider branching out into more advanced territory as you learn.

Consider the audience that your domain could ""touch""; how broad is it?;
, Taking a look at what your competitors are doing can give you an idea for how valuable a domain is.

If you owned LOAN.com, which could be considered second best to Loans.com, I would take the fact stated above into consideration.

, The more memorable the domain, the better. Being short in length can help with this part, and hyphens will often confuse people when they talk about your domain to others. Hyphens and typically, longer domains can detract from the value.

, When selecting a domain name, appraise it by considering the presence of the keyword. The keyword should be also present when creating a new domain name. The purpose of including the keyword is to optimize the search engines. The keyword should not be too competitive nor have a too low competition in that there is insufficient searches for it globally or locally.

Keep the writing style intact.,
Keep within your expertise.,
Keep the posts coming.,
Keep the posts well ordered.,
Keep the blog search engine friendly.,
Use quality images that are yours to use.,
Stay engaged with your readership.,
Continue to promote your blog.,
Keep the content flowing and keep it simple and fresh.",How to Maintain the Freshness and Relevance of Your Blog Over Time," Writing style matters long term because you develop your own voice or group of voices, depending on whether you're writing an individual or group blog. This voice should remain consistent and like a personal friend for your readers over time, allowing them to feel they've come to know you almost as a friend, and definitely as someone who can be trusted on the information imparted. Keep in mind that readers get used to your way of writing and do not appreciate it when it changes.


If it's a group blog, each relevant person should maintain their posts on their interests instead of too many contributing to it.
If there is to be more than one writer, then categorize the posts as per the writer. So that the reader knows who is responsible for writing each post.;
, Don't range too widely outside of what you know. be realistic and write about what you know so that it comes across as authoritative, erudite and authentic. If you want to bring in topics you're not so knowledgeable about but have a passion for, get some guest bloggers in from those areas, and ensure that they're people you admire and trust.


If you're a Renaissance person, that's great, you can range further but even then, keep it real.

, This is a bit of a balancing act. Frequent posts are important to keep your blog fresh, interesting and alive. On the other hand, too many updates can cause readers to feel overwhelmed in their busy lives. Decide how often you feel capable of posting, then match that to a regular rhythm that works for you. Try for at least one post a week, and no more than three. More than three will exhaust your readers and can drive them to abandon your blog–-remember that there is a lot going on in every person's life and you'd like your blog to be a tiny but high quality part of it.


If you have various bloggers contributing to the one blog, work out when each one is going to blog so that there is a good spacing between their posts, or so that they're reaching a different audience at different times.
Don't be afraid to ask readers how much posting is good for them. They'll give you an indication if you ask politely and seriously.
Focus on regular intervals of high quality content.

, Readers like to find topics of interest with ease, and sometimes they'll want to come back to favorites that you've written in the past. Using good categorization can help make this a lot easier for your readers. Use tags and categories to keep things easy-to-find and well ordered.


Categories provide a sense of flow, depth and reliability to your blog. They give readers a sense that something is happening as the posts fill up categories and show that your blog is continuous and expert.
Categories ensure neatness and are simply attractive to look at. Readers like the idea of containment and organization that the categories bring.

, Ensure that the blog has good textual content above all. Images and videos are the icing on the cake––it is still the writing that attracts readers and search engines. More important than an insane obsession with keywords is fresh, well written and useful content. Content that people like and share. Focus on that rather than sprinkling search or click bait throughout the text.


Ensure that the text is accessible, easy to read and of high quality. If you haven't already, do a free online course in writing for websites and blogs. There are plenty on offer through reputable universities on free course sites. There is no excuse for not learning these basics.

, Images enhance the content, help it to pop and really draw in the readers. They're also the thing many people love to share, on Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, etc., so be liberal with them. Also ensure they're of a decent enough size that they take up a lot of the screen and really draw the eyes in.


Match the images to the text. The images still must have meaning and not be placed randomly.
Avoid ripping off images from places that you don't have rights to. Readers are savvy and someone, somewhere, will know it's copied. Use on that which fits the rights you're using on your blog, public domain and self-owned images.
Over time, keep an image bank, and categorize the images as well. This helps your readers to find your posts through images as well as continuing to share the images and potentially draw more readers back to your blog.

, Readers don't make comments on posts out of self-amusement. Most people genuinely seek interaction with you, to provide feedback, to give encouragement, to point out errors, and yes, even to vent. It's your responsibility to always answer these politely and as fully as possible. Your readers care about your content, so care about your readers. Even if you think sometimes that they're being a challenge or even trying to trick you, stay level-headed, stick to the facts and be kind.


Clean out spam and nasty comments regularly. Your readers don't deserve to see that sort of content on the blog. You have every right to remove comments that are not constructive feedback but are just plain vitriol. The world will be a better place for that.

, It's probable that you spent a lot of energies to get your blog known at the beginning. Don't become lax about this over time, as you gain more readers. The aim is to keep getting more and more readers, to get your material out there and really well known. Continue to promote the site through social media related to your blog and have your readers, your friends and those who love your work spread the news too.


Publicize your each and every blog post on all our social media platforms. This will fuel the number of hits on your blog.

, People love novel content. They also love posts that they can get a lot of of without having to squint, spend too long reading or jump to other sites to get the information needed. This means use a good sized font, keep posts to a decent length that is neither overly long nor too short and explain yourself before sending readers to other posts or places.


Keep the formatting consistent in all posts and keep it neat, easy to read and use plenty of spacing for ease of reading.

Let's get one thing straight right off the mark : this is going to be a guide to how to do this for FREE.,First off you need a reputable software company to create a website template for you and the best one is wordpress, here is the address - http://www.wordpress.com go ahead and visit the site

,
Click on Sign up now and fill out the first page on the form that pops up.

,
On the next page you need to think of a good name for your website and fill it in.,
When you submit the form you need to visit your email account to activate your new account.,
OK your account is now active and if you click on the link that says ""View your site"" - Well Done you now have your very own website!

,
The next step is to setup your website.,
Wow - you now have your own dashboard for your website!!,
Let's choose a design for your new website.,
Once you have a design you like click on ""Posts"" in the left column and go ahead and add a test review.",How to Build a Digital Camera Review Website," Sure you can spend a little if you want but then things get a little more complicated so we will keep things nice and simple to start with.;
,,, Bear in mind the obvious names will probably already have been chosen so try to think creatively. For example ""digitalcamerareviews"" was already chosen when I filled out the form but ""mydigitalcameraviews"" was available.

, Go ahead and do this.

,, Click on the back button in your web browser to go back to where you clicked on the ""View your site"" link. Next to it there is another link which says ""Login"". Click on this link and you know have a wordpress login page. Go ahead and fill in your username and password ( you created these earlier when you created your account ).

, On this page you can add content, change the design, moderate comments and reviews, check stats for your new website, in fact pretty much anything. Go ahead and have a look around.

, Scroll down the left column to ""Appearance"". There are about 80 different designs to choose from.

, This will then show up on your website. Don't worry you can delete it later on your dashboard. You can also add links to other websites too. And don't forget to add Categories so it will be easier to find reviews once you have added a few. You could categorize by brand i.e. Nikon, Canon, Olympus etc. or SLR, Digital etc. it's up to you.

Get your brain around what kinds of tools and processes will accomplish your goals.,
Choose your software development tools.,
In the course of resolving these questions, we inevitably have to examine the basic models or patterns of developing projects of the nature we desire to turn out.,
No matter your choice of programming tools, there is no way to avoid dependence upon a reasonable mastery of HTML and CSS.",How to Build a Dynamic Website," Because the very central core of any dynamic web presence is its database and processing of data, our first vital goal is to make a far-reaching decision on a database engine. It is not a good idea to hope to casually make such a decision in just some seeming, most reasonable initial manner.


The vital object of this first decision is to plan our project in a manner (with tools and database engines) which will support your needs all the way down a road through a future, in which, because you made the right initial decisions, you will build effectively upon your initial foundation, efficiently and without eventual obstruction. This means that ideally for instance, the database engine you choose isn't just the easy, or seemingly simple one to deploy today; from the beginning it must be an engine which will support your downstream processing demands.
Sometimes commercial considerations further affect such choices. What engines are attendance intensive (and costly)? What engines are virtually attendance free in implementations sustaining the processing goals your eventual project must sustain? Generally, the pattern to follow is to select your engine based on one of two possible dispositions.
To do so, you must first chart out your basic table needs. A professional won't even need to build this map (regardless even if hundreds or thousands of tables are involved), because they will usually immediately see whether the architecture and future needs you will need to support are either read or write intensive. You will then choose an appropriate database, based on this overall disposition, and perhaps further based on personal taste and experience, as working with respective software development tools may predicate. MySQL is the usual choice for read intensive implementations. Many developers look to databases such as PostgreSQL for reliable write intensive implementations. We develop our dispositions toward such vital tools by careful research, and by drawing on the pool of experience of the general software development industry. Expense can generally be avoided, because free deployments of very good tools are available. What we're looking for is performance in either read or write intensive environments, reliability, ease and minimization of administration, and ready integration with prospective software development tools.;
, There are two patterns to consider in choosing software development tools. Purportedly ""easy"" tools are rarely in fact easy, when a project inevitably breaks the cast of the development and functionality patterns ""easy"" tools are generally limited to. Should you want to do something beyond the ""easy"" tools such as incorporate a language or translation parameter in dynamically generated URLS, it may be so much more difficult to accomplish in the ""easy"" tools that it may take extremely sophisticated programming skills to as much as trick the easy pattern into doing more complex things. We must master our tools to build good projects. This does not make easy tools the best choice, or the most sophisticated tools a difficult proposition. The trap of ""easy"" development generally comprises limitations which become very costly to overcome in the inevitable evolution of projects. A huge variety of such tools generally arises, ostensibly meeting such needs. But the pattern of the tools' persistence betrays an ostensible fact of having accomplished this goal; and so, generally we find that the most sophisticated and powerful tools, following good patterns (or availability of objects and libraries), not only alleviate practically inevitable obstructions to easy tools, but likewise then make ""getting there"" a far more straightforward process. When we examine the scope of available tools, generally less comprehensive models are presented in initial development concepts, and better concepts are offered by later arising tools (or they wouldn't have a chance to survive in markets which have already been won). If we choose a purportedly easy tool then, what we're looking for is a development pattern which is both wieldy and without eventual obstruction. The paradox for the neophyte then is the difficulty of seeing so far down the road that we can perceive programming obstructions to a given tool set. Some people believe the best tools are the most powerful and the least restrictive in terms of project approach. Freedom to develop what you want and need often means breaking the general model of ostensibly simple tools then, the challenges of which can practically break the brain of the most seasoned and sophisticated software engineer, because succeeding in such an object means making the ""simple"" model do something it may have no native capacity for supporting. Is ""Ruby"" for instance really an easier tool than fundamental C++ or C#? No. Not really, especially if you have to break the simple model of Ruby to deliver vital functionality. Like Ruby, GCC is free for Linux and OSX. Ruby also comes on OSX ― you just have to discover it on your system. Of the purportedly easier tools, my personal choice is Ruby. Of the truly sophisticated tools, C++ and C# will reign supreme long into the future; and the truth is, these are the only vehicles for development without obstruction. So sit up straight and brace for serious study, because regardless the road you choose, you are going to have to master not only your tools, but the potentially restrictive models which those tools might eventually encumber you with. Ruby is probably far more clean than almost all its ""easy"" peers. C++ is the tool of unencumbered excellence; and in fact, seasoned gurus will turn out peerless projects probably with far less difficulty than they might accomplish the same goals with a purportedly easy tool. In the end, developers who stray from this observation pay some price: either pick the most conducive ""easy"" tool, or worry less over the freedom from encumbrance in the most sophisticated tool. In the latter case, you master Fast CGI objects, take the ball and run. Huge concepts are implemented often with little code. Yes, simple tools make the same claim, but by abstracting ostensible difficulty away from us in such ways that deviating from their usually singular pattern poses very difficult engineering challenges, in addition to performance handicaps which C++ resolves.

, This means grabbing the best literature for tools we want to compare, and at least giving our concept some form in which it might take in a given set of tools, as compared to others. Before you choose Ruby for instance, you might pick up vital books such as ""The Ruby Programming Language,"" and ""Agile Web Development with Rails."" Your initial study must not only sufficiently master the tools, it must envision how you can get there ― how you can provide desired functionality with the tool you might choose. This is a daunting task for the initiate. If you are going to compare a purportedly easy development environment to the best of the best, you're going to have to evaluate the best C tools as well. If you're really going to be a seasoned engineer, you're going to pick C for its freedom from limitation. Is C really more difficult? No. Syntax is syntax. In the end, you have to master expressing the same functionality; and in truth, the C family of languages is excellent. The difficult thing about excelling right out the gate in C++ is putting your hands on the models you might need to build upon. An excellent start from practically 15 years ago was the original FastCGI components which were available in Borland's CPPBuilder ― probably still the best C++ for Windows. Even C initiates can go far with such object oriented approaches, because the general model of sustaining functionality is built into the very things you work with. Your work is far more free-flowing than it can be in Ruby for instance, whenever you might break or exceed the Ruby model in your approach. On the other hand, Rails scaffolding techniques expedite much work for the neophyte, if and only if the project fits the general mold of Ruby and Rails. Introduce rudimentary security provisions for instance, recognized in all your Ruby interfaces however, and the next thing you know, you're re-writing a thousand lines of auto-generated Ruby code for every table your application negotiates. Is that easy? Well, I do it with a Windows editor called NoteTab Pro, operating on Ruby projects residing on an OSX system; and sophisticated macros make my revisions in perhaps a second, customizing a thousand lines of code into almost twice that. Still, this relates to relatively simple, basic functionality, which a project is restricted to. The fact is, in C++ we can write our own objects which handle these tasks truly universally ― you'd never even have to replicate this process. So these are the trade-offs. In the end, object oriented C is the most powerful and efficient. Which means it's the least work as well.

According to Google, interesting, well-curated blogs will naturally move up the search result rankings.Produce content that attracts visitors and inspires them to share your blog with their friends.;
, Search engine ""spiders"" cannot “see” your site—they are only capable of reading your content and the blog’s code. Furthermore, these spiders only “read” approximately the first third of each page before moving on to the next page. You can improve the bot’s ability to crawl and index your site by:


Providing more text (i.e. crawlable content).
Placing the content as close to the top of the page as possible.As you produce more crawlable and indexable information, you will rise in the search results.

, Google encourages bloggers to pepper their content with key phrases and words that a member of your target audience may use in a search. When someone searches, the search engine shows results for sites that include the same words and/or phrases.


Balance is the key. Be careful not to overuse these key words and phrases.
These keywords and phrases should also appear in your HTML title tags, meta “description” tags, anchor text, alt text, headings, and URLS."

Some blogging platforms, like WordPress, provide a built-in source code editor. If your blogging platform does not, you can edit your site's html files through Google Chrome's Developer Tool, or with the following standard method:Download the html file to your computer.
Open the html file with a text editor.
Make the changes to the html file.
Save the files to your computer and then upload them back to your site., When a search engine ""spider"" crawls and indexes your blog, it compares the words in your content to the words contained within HTML tags. You can improve your ranking by making sure that these words match.Google recommends that every page of your blog should have a unique, descriptive HTML title tag (a distinct page title) within its header tag. The title should succinctly and accurately describe the page’s content. For example:





<html>
<head>
<title>How to Get Your Blog to Appear at the Top of Searches</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>





Each page within your site should have a unique HTML title tag. Do not use generic page titles, like “Page 1” or “Blog 5/16.” Do not name your home page, “Home Page.”
This title will also appear as the first line of a search result for your site. As a result, both search engines and users assess the relevance of your blog post based on the contents of your title tag., Underneath the first line of a search result, you will often see a brief description of the page. Search engines either pull this ""snippet"" directly from the page’s content or use a summary contained within a HTML meta “description” tag. The HTML meta “description” tag is placed inside the HTML header tag. According to Google, the contents of this tag allows bots to determine if your page is relevant to the user’s inquiry. For example:





<html>
<head>
<title>How to Get Your Blog to Appear at the Top of Searches</title>
<meta name=“description” content=“In How to Get Your Blog to Appear at the Top of Searches, we will discuss Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategies.</meta>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>





Compose an individual “description” for each page of your site.
The summary should be between one sentence and one paragraph long.
Make sure your summary accurately describes the page.
Thoughtfully integrate keywords and key phrases in your meta tag “description.”, Anchor text is the hyperlinked text users click on to follow a link. By writing brief, detailed anchor text for each link, you will assist search engines and users in determining what the linked-to-page is about. For example:





<html>
<head>
<title>How to Get Your Blog to Appear at the Top of Searches</title>
<meta name=“description” content=“In <i>How to Get Your Blog to Appear at the Top of Searches</i>, we will discuss Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategies.</meta>

</body>
</html>





Produce anchor text that is descriptive, brief, and relevant to the linked page. Avoid simple anchor text, like “click here” or “blog.”
Google suggests that you should write anchor text for internal and external links. The search engine also encourages web masters to format their anchor text so that is stands out from standard content., Every image on your blog can have a separate filename and alt text. Alt text is a description of the image that appears when a search engine does not support the image file or when users are engaging with your site via screen reader. (Screen readers allow blind and visually impaired individuals to read websites). Google claims that assigning descriptive file names and alt text to each image can aid an image search engines in its understanding of the picture. For example:





<html>
<head>
<title>How to Get Your Blog to Appear at the Top of Searches</title>
<meta name=“description” content=“In <i>How to Get Your Blog to Appear at the Top of Searches</i>, we will discuss Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategies.</meta>

<img src=“blog-top-searches_banner.jpeg” alt=“Make Your Blog a Top Result”> 
</body>
</html>





The image’s filename and alt text should be short, yet descriptive. Do not use stock filenames and alt text, like “<img src=“banner.jpeg” alt=“Banner 5/16”>.”"

Improve your blog’s navigational structure for bots.,
Validate your code.",How to Get Your Blog to Appear at the Top of Searches4," According to Google, search engines value distinctive and descriptive domain names and subpages.

In a search result, it is important to note that your blog’s url will also appear under the HTML title tag and snippet s—choose words that might interest one of your target audience members.


Make sure the URL is related to the content displayed on the page.
Only create one URL per page. This URL should be used in internal links., Well-organized pages are easier for users to navigate. There are a variety of methods you can use to make your site more user-friendly. Google recommends that you:


Place your blog’s content into a hierarchical organization structure. The structure should be based on how you think users will move through your blog.
Provide users a standard navigation bar on each and every page. This will allow users to easily navigate between pages of your blog. The link to your home page should appear on the left, followed in descending order by links to the most popular sections of your site.
Include a site map, a single page that shows your blog’s hierarchy of pages. If users are having trouble navigating through your site with the “breadcrumb” links, they can use the site map to move through the blog. , Thinking through the hierarchy of your blog’s pages will also make your site easier for search engine bots (also called spiders) to crawl. A well organized site will make it easier for bots, like Googlebot, to move through your site and determine how a single page relates to the entire website. Google suggests:


Submitting a XML Sitemap to search engines to make it easier for bots to find, crawl, and index your blog.
Make sure your navigational links are text-heavy. If possible, do not use images, animations, or drop down menus—these may prevent bots from accessing your entire site.

Block Search Engines from crawling unnecessary parts of your site, like comments sections and links to sites that may damage the reputation of your blog., Errors in your blog’s code may prevent search engines from crawling and indexing your site. You can avoid this situation by making sure your code validates, or conforms to accepted standard of the programing language.

Make sure that you invite guests well in advance so you are not waiting for the content. You can invite friends and family members who have an interest in the subject matter of your blog or who can share some valuable information. Another option is to invite other bloggers to write something for your site. You may be asked to reciprocate. You could also hire contributing writers or even ghost writers if you are desperate for more fresh content.

, If you see something on another site that you like, contact the author and ask if you can copy it, credit them, and link back to their site. You could just copy a small part and refer the reader back to the original source. Another option would be to mention the content, offer some feedback, and then link back to the site.

, If you are getting subject related questions on your comments section, or you are getting questions emailed to you, make those questions and your response a blog entry. This interaction is great for building rapport with your readers.

, You should know who these people are if you read other blogs with the same subject matter as yours. Contact the person with a request to interview them. If they agree, send them your questions. Your questions, their answers, and a small introduction are your fresh content. Just make sure you request this interview well in advance and don't expect a same day response.

, You could also refer them to the top 10 websites on a topic related to the subject matter of your website.

, This is a great way of breaking up formal business entries with light content.

Now look at the sites of your competition again, see if they are targeting the keyword correctly, that is, using it in HTML, (shows as the blue link title in Google).",How to Find Profitable Keywords,";
, Go to Google and type in your keyword, you will get a listing of the number of pages for your keyword. To get the number of pages with your exact phrase or word, use quotes e.g. "" golf clubs"".

, This is really a very powerful tool for keyword research. Type in your search keyword, you will get a list, click on ""show estimated cpc"" , ""show advertisers competition"". Now look at the drop down menu, click ""approx avg search volume"", the keywords are sorted by highest number of searches. Remember the higher the number of searches, the more difficult it will be to rank high on Google, as the market is liable to be saturated.

, Look at the top three sites that come up in Google for your keyword. Google rates each page on a scale 0-10, called page rank, if you find the first page Google results full of page rank 0 , your ranking will be easier.

, If it is not there, the site is perhaps unaware of the keyword, or does not know how to target it. The ideal keywords have sites with low page rank, and are not targeting the keywords.

Interact with other blogs.,
Cross blog!,
Submit your posts and links to your blog on tools like forums, discovery engines, peer-sourced news feeds and social networking sites.,
Write great headlines and subject lines.,
Step back and analyze your blog as objectively as possible.,
Stay consistent.",How to Get People to Read Your Blog1," This helps create relationships with both the blogger whose blog you're interacting with and the people who follow that blog.


Make interesting, relevant comments on popular blogs. This will spark curiosity about your blog, and you may be able to pull followers.
Respond to every comment someone leaves on your blog. You want the person who is responding to your entry to feel welcomed, respected and deserving of attention. This will make them more likely to talk about and share your blog with other people.
Find blogs similar to yours to interact with - liked minded individuals will want to see your view on the interest you share.
Respond to popular, topical articles or blog posts on your own blog. People like to see how writers interact with each other and will be interested to see how you responded to someone whose opinion they care about.;
, Simply share an entry from one of your blogs with another one of your blogs - either by providing a link or copy and pasting, or both. This is a great way to get multiple audiences interested in your material.


If you have more than one blog, cross post entries from the blog you want to become popular to your most popular blog. The people who follow you on one may begin to follow you on the other.
If you don't have more than one blog, consider creating another blog or two with different blogging programs - even if you end up just creating a replica of your original blog.
There are different sets of audiences who swear by different blogging programs. You can access these different bloggers and their followers by using as many blogging programs as possible to publish your entries.

, This is very natural way to create interest in your blog among bloggers and non-bloggers alike.


The goal here is similar to cross blogging - get your content out on as many venues as possible.
Consider using your personal social media accounts and email signatures to get people who are already connected to you connected to your blog.

, If people see an entry with a truly eye-catching lead, they're more likely to read it than something that seems dull or dry.


Consider how headlines affect the likelihood that someone will click on a cross posted or shared link. Interesting headlines and subject lines are essential to successfully gathering interest through third parties.

, Does your blog look poorly put together? And have people seen it a thousand times before? Are your images relevant to your topic? Content may be king, but if you present it in a bad way people just won’t read it.


Avoid small fonts, lousy contrast, poor design and difficult to read colors – they’re all turnoffs. Looks are important; first impressions last.
Make sure your blog is properly functioning. There are too many blogs with dead links, plugins that bug out, and other problems.
Clear out the clutter. Less is always more. No amount of widgets or other “cool things” will keep a person interested in your blog. It may even distract them away from your writing. Direct them to your content in an interesting and streamlined way.
Make sure you have a little introduction or indication of what your blog is about near the top of your blog's home page. This way people will know if your blog is relevant to what they're interested in. If you write it well enough, you may even convert people to your interests.

, Don't lose followers because you failed to update for a while, or changed the theme of your blog unexpectedly.


If you're finding it hard to update at least weekly, look at similar blogs to yours and find entries that created a lot of comments. Lots of comments means that this person wrote about a controversial topic and you can use your response to someone else's blog as a foundation for your own entry.
If you want to post something unusual given the theme of your blog, consider mentioning that and posting it under a link instead - your followers will appreciate that you're thinking about their time and interest.

Research search engine optimization, also known as SEO.,
Consider manipulating your content to include more key words.,
Link to popular blogs you like and websites relevant to your topic.",How to Get People to Read Your Blog2," SEO is a strategy that web developers use to increase the likelihood that someone will find their site in a search.


There are both complex and simple ways to optimize your blog for search engines. Read up on how other people do this and decide what strategy will work for your skill level, your needs and your content.

, The most popular way to increase your search engine ranking is to make sure you're using the words that people are looking for.


Take on the perspective of your potential audience. Search some things related to your blog topic on a few search engines and see what sites are popping up on the first page. Read those sites carefully - what words seem to be in every paragraph, what words continually reappear in subject lines?

, Make allies, try to convince them to link to your blog over time.


Share the link to your blog frequently. The more people click on your link, and the more closely related your blog seems to other popular websites, the more likely it is to show up on a search engine.

Store your blog's files in the correct place.",How to Host a Blog," Some service providers will not allow you to host your own web content. Make sure hosting your blog does not violate your agreement before proceeding.;
, You will be hosting your blog from your own computer, so remember that when your computer is turned off or offline, your blog will be inaccessible over the Internet. Schedule Windows updates to occur at a time when most users will not be online (in the middle of the night, for example), because they will restart your computer. Also, make sure to set your virus scanning software to only scan once per day, instead of scanning in real time. This will free up your computer's resources for hosting the blog.

, To host a website, your computer needs unrestricted communications access to the Internet. Open the firewall control panel in Windows, and click on the ""Exceptions"" tab. Click the ""Add Port"" button, and enable the following 3 ports: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and MYSQL (3306).

, For general web use, most computers will be set up to obtain an IP address automatically, which means the address may change. To run a web server, however, you need an IP address that doesn't change, so that you can point your domain name (your blog's URL) to that IP address.


Click on the ""Start"" button and click ""Run."" Type ""cmd"" into the text field and press Enter. In the command prompt that appears, type ""ipconfig /all."" This will display the network settings configured for your computer.
Under the heading ""Local Area Connection,"" look for the entries marked ""IP Address,"" ""Subnet Mask,"" ""Default Gateway,"" and all the IP addresses listed under ""DNS Servers."" Write all this information down and then close the window.
Open the Network Connections menu in the Control Panel. Right-click on the ""Local Area Connection"" icon and click ""Properties."" In the window that appears, select the ""TCP/IP"" option and click the ""Properties"" button.
The window that appears will have 2 options: ""Obtain an IP address automatically,"" and ""Use the following."" Select ""Use the following,"" and enter all the information you wrote down into the appropriate fields.
In the IP address field, however, you want to enter a different number. Enter the IP address you wrote down, but change the last set of digits (after the final decimal point) to something much higher than what you wrote down. For example, if you have written ""67.168.129.10,"" then you could change the address to ""67.168.129.250."" Click the ""OK"" button to save the changes.
Open your web browser to make sure you're still connected to the Internet after making the changes.

, Access your router's configuration screen; this is usually done by opening a web browser and navigating to the address ""192.168.0.1."" If that doesn't work, consult the manual or support website for your particular router. Find the menu for port forwarding in the configuration screen, and specify the static IP address that you chose above in the appropriate field. Then, enable TCP ports 80, 443, and 3306 to forward to that IP address.

, Your blog will need a domain name (for example, www.myblog.com) and a service for pointing that domain name to your IP address. DynDNS is a company that offers a free service to accomplish this; simply download their software and keep it running on your computer. When users type your blog's URL into the browser, DynDNS's service will point their browser to the website that you are hosting from your own computer.

, You will need 3 things to host your blog at home: the Apache web server, the PHP scripting language, and the MySQL database server. You don't actually have to know how any of these work in depth, as you won't need to interface with them directly. The easiest way to install these components is by downloading a free application called XAMPP, which will install all of them with a few simple clicks.

, The default installation for XAMPP doesn't enable any security features, so you will want to add them. Open your web browser, type in the address ""http://localhost"" and press Enter. This will take you to the XAMPP configuration screen. Click on the ""Security"" menu, and select the option to password protect your MySQL root and XAMPP settings. Choose a password to protect the settings.


, The only thing left to do is put all your web content where it needs to be. Navigate to the location where you installed XAMPP, and locate the ""htdocs"" folder inside the XAMPP folder. Store all of your blog's files (web pages, images, etc.) in this folder. If you are using software such as WordPress to build your blog, refer to their manual for hosting your content from home.

Actually, it is very hard for a blog beginner or newbie to have a large blog, i.e., a personal blog community with considerable readers and commenters.

In most cases, the blog owners who have received positive comments from you will make good comments on your blog as reciprocity. In this way, you can reap what you have sown easily.

, They always hold the same views and the same purpose with you. Make comments on other freshman's blog and you are supposed to get more comments in return. You can help each other and get mutual benefits.

, Pay attention to the regular blog viewers and the blog visitors who leave comments on your blog repeatedly. They are loyal followers of your blog or the ones attempting to make a name through your niche. Whatever the intentions are, they want to share feelings and interact with you.

, Also, there is some other way to make your blog followers or subscribers to comment more willingly - offer your blog viewers with really good things such as some useful software. But this way of winning more comments for your blogs should surely be based on the premise that your blog readers would not feel being asked too much. This is the pre-condition to ensure that they will share their feelings gratefully. So you'd better provide this software copies to them free without excessive requirement.

Know your client's expertise on the internet.,
Determine your client's learning style.,
Break down what SEO stands for.,
Explain what SEO does for the client using simple phrases.,
Familiarize yourself with your client's website.",How to Explain SEO to Clients1," Before you start explaining SEO to your client, consider how much your client knows about the internet. This will help you determine what tactic you should use when explaining SEO. The last thing you'd want is to confuse your client by using unfamiliar terms, or insult your client by using too simple explanations. For example:


If your client is unfamiliar with the internet, including websites, search engines, blogs, links, and so forth, consider using more analogies and comparisons. Terms such as ""search results"" and ""links"" may confuse your client.
If your client is familiar with the internet, he or she may already have an idea of how searching for things on the internet works. Terms such as ""search results"" and ""links"" will probably get the point across, and you won't have to use as many analogies or comparisons.
If your client is very familiar with the internet and how it works, a simple definition might be all it takes to get him or her to understand SEO.;
, Different people learn things in different ways, so you may have to employ various techniques to get your point across. There are three main learning styles: verbal, visual, and physical.You may have to use a combination of two or all three styles to explain SEO to your client.


Some people learn new concepts better through discussing them verbally over the phone or in person. Consider setting up a meeting with your client to discuss SEO with him or her.
Some people learn new concepts better through visual means. This could be as simple as sending your client an email with a definition of SEO to as extensive as providing them with a chart or diagram.
Some people are physical learners, and need something demonstrated for them. Consider drawing a chart when discussing SEO, and pointing out parts to the client while speaking. You can also show them how it works physically on a computer.

, If you have a client who is completely new to the concept of SEO, he or she may never have heard of it before and may not know what it stands for. In this case, you will simply have to say: ""SEO stands for 'Search Engine Optimization.'""

, Your client may not understand the importance of ""Search Engine Optimization"" until he or she understands what it does. You may have to explain to your client what SEO does. For example, you could say:


""SEO helps your website appear on the first few pages of the search results.""
""SEO helps your website appear sooner when someone searches for..."" (You then will list the terms someone might use to find your client's business).
""SEO makes it easier for people to find your business/website.""

, Knowing what your client does and what his or her website is about may come in handy for when you have to use analogies, comparisons, or scenarios. Consider using some variation of your client's name, website, or line of business in your analogies, comparisons, or scenarios.

"
"
Break SEO down into two parts.,
Explain how ""Optimization"" relates to SEO.,
Explain ""Authority"" and how it relates to SEO.,
Put it all together.",How to Explain SEO to Clients2," One of the simplest and easiest ways is to break SEO down into two parts: Optimization and Authority.This method includes a lot of terms such as ""site"" and ""search engine"" and is best for clients who are already familiar with the internet and how it works.

, Your client needs to understand that optimization allows reputable search engines to read his or her website, and then evaluate it. You can say something like this:


""Optimization allows a search engine to read the content of your website. The search engine will then display your site in the results when someone searches for the keywords that appear on your site.""

, Your client also needs to understand that having authority proves to the search engine that his or her website is the best website. For example, you could say:


""The more authority your website has, the higher up on the search results it will be. Having your website appear on others will prove to the search engine that your site is better than all others on the same topic.""

, After you have broken down SEO into ""Optimization"" and ""Authority,"" you want to repeat all that you have said in a shorter form: ""SEO is two things: allowing search engines to display your website when people search for it, and convincing search engines to place it before other sites in the results.""

"
"
Use the library analogy.,
Take your client and his or her website into consideration.,
Compare your client's website to a book.,
Compare finding a website to finding a book.,
Compare your client's website to a missing book.,
Compare links to good book reviews.",How to Explain SEO to Clients3," A great way to help illustrate a certain concept is to use analogies. One popular analogy to explain SEO is the library analogy.Most people are familiar with how libraries work; children and teenagers often have to use libraries to obtain sources and information for their school projects and reports.

, Using your client and his or her website in your library analogy might help your client make the connections. It will also help keep him or her engaged.

, Compare your client's website to a book on a familiar subject, preferably one that has something to do with his or her website. Try to use a variation of the website's name as the title, and a variation of your client's name as the author. For example:


If your client's name is Bob McBob, and Bob's Window Cleaning is the name of his website, use Window Cleaning by Bob Windowman as your fictional book. Window cleaning is something that your client can relate to, which will help keep him engaged.
While you are at it, compare your client's competitors' websites to other books in the library on the same topic. So Wendy's Windows could become a book called Wonderfully Clean Windows by Wendy Wonders.

, The two ways someone can find your client's website is by either typing the URL into the address bar directly, or by typing in keywords into the search bar of a reputable search engine. Similarly, the two ways someone can find a book in a library is by either finding the book on the shelf, or by typing keywords into the library's computer. For example:


Bob McBob specializes in cleaning windows on multistory buildings. To find his website, someone could go to a reputable search engine, and type in words such as ""window cleaning"" and ""multistory"" and the city or suburb that Bob McBob has his business in.

Window Cleaning by Bob Windowman happens to have an entire chapter on cleaning windows on multistory buildings. Someone could find his book by going to the library computer and search the catalog using the terms ""window cleaning"" and ""multistory"" or ""skyscrapers.""

, If a book is not categorized properly in the library catalog, then no one will be able to find it. Similarly, no one will be able to find your client's website unless it contains the keywords people would most likely type into a search engine while trying to find it.


A person searching for Window Cleaning by Bob Windowman won't find the book if the book is not tagged in the library catalog.
A person searching for someone to clean his or her windows on a multistory house won't be able to find Bob McBob's website unless he uses keywords, such as ""window cleaning"" and ""multistory"" on his website.

, One of the reasons someone might choose a certain book over another is because it had good reviews. A well-reviewed book might even be displayed at the front section of the library on a shelf titled ""Good Reads"" or ""Top-Reviewed."" Similarly, the more websites link to your client's site, the more likely a search engine will see it as being reputable—and will place it towards the top of the search results. Your client needs to understand this. For example:


Bob Windowman knows how to write really well, which means that his book has gotten great reviews. They were so good, in fact, that the library placed the book in the front section of the library, reserved for well-reviewed books. It is placed on the Non-Fiction section of the shelf.
In order to get his website to be more visible (that is, appear on the front page of the search results) Bob McBob needs to convince the search engine that his website is good. Getting linked will convince the search engine to place his website at the top, much how good reviews will convince a library to place a book in a more visible location.

Consider explaining SEO with a fishing metaphor.,
Compare content to bait, and people to fish.,
Compare keywords to the quality of the bait.,
Compare your client's target audience to specific fish.,
Compare where your client advertises to fishing spots.,
Compare your client's desired audience to a fisherman's desired fish.",How to Explain SEO to Clients4," Not everyone has gone fishing before, but most people understand how fishing works, which can make this metaphor helpful. Compare different parts of SEO to different parts of fishing. , If your client wants to attract lots of people to his or her website, he or she will need lots of content. Similarly, if a fisherman wants to catch a lot of fish, he will need a lot of bait. If he does not have a lot of bait, he will not catch a lot of fish. Content will include things like:


Titles, paragraphs, product descriptions, summaries—basically anything that is written.
Images, pictures, videos, and any other media content.
Links and multiple pages.

, The better content your client's website is, the more visitors he or she will receive. Similarly, the better quality bait a fisherman has, the more fish he will catch.

, When going fishing, the type of fish the fisherman is trying to catch will determine where he will go fishing and what bait he will use. For example, a fisherman looking to catch tuna will not go to a river or lake, he will go to the ocean. Similarly, your client needs to know where to find his target audience, and advertise there. For example:


If your client is a car repairman specializing in antique cars, he won't find much traffic in websites centered around women's makeup, hair, and nails. He would want to advertise in a local newspaper instead, or websites selling antique cars.

, Fishermen know where to cast their fishing line, and your client should know where to advertise his or her website. A fisherman cannot catch fish without physically being at the lake, river, or ocean. Once there, he cannot catch a fish at the other end of the river, or the other side of the lake. Fishing rods can only cast so far, and attempting to do so may result in a tangled fishing line. Similarly, your client should try to target local clients instead. For example:


There are lots of people who specialize in painting houses. If your client tries to target a general audience, his website will get lost amongst the other websites. Instead, your client should try to target clients in his town, city, or suburb.

, A fisherman going fishing for tuna will not be looking to catch other fish. He wants only tuna, and gets a special fishing pole, a large boat, and special bait in order to catch lots of tuna. Similarly, your client needs to know his or her audience, and create a website that is popular with that sort of audience. For example:


If your client's website is targeted towards teenagers, he or she will want to use more color and images. He or she will also have to consider language; something written using short, upbeat, and catchy sentences is more likely to keep a teenager's attention than long, rambling paragraphs, filled with complex, overly-descriptive sentences.

This will allow you to write up your website quickly and focus on the design of the site, rather than rush around trying to create “quality” content at the last minute.;
, This is a critical mistake that far too many people commit as a new webmaster. They explore how their site indexed quickly as they promote their site, and how to get visitors to their site, but they forget to actually develop their website. The quality of your website must always be of paramount importance.

, For example, you might have these pages from the beginning: “Home”, “blog”, “article,” “misc,” “contact” and “about”. It is advantageous if you already have the basic food information (Contact, About, etc.), so you just throw in the information once you have prepared to publish your website.

Make sure that each member of a related fit, and that any link will do for your visitors (and spiders) easier browsing.

,, Use the Google Keyword Tool to analyze what people are searching for in your niche. Once you have found a few phrases that you think fit your website’s content, start optimizing your pages by strategically placing those keywords throughout your content.

, However, make sure you use those phrases (and variations of those phrases) enough to attract attention from the search engines. If it flows well, also make your anchor text (the text that appears for a hyperlink) mimic the keyword(s) highlight the keyword phrases you have chosen. This will help those search engine spiders understand what your content is all about and tell them how to rank it in the respective search engines.

, Registering an account on social media sites with the same username as your blog’s URL is very effective in getting your blog indexed by search engines, especially for those targeted keywords.


For example, if your blog’s name is Tuto9, it’s a good practice to register the same username at twitter as @Tuto9, and to create a page in Facebook. Having a consistent keyword-username on all major social media sites will help get your blog indexed faster, and at a later stage it will also help build a “brand” for your blog.
Get an account on major social sites, namely: Twitter, Facebook (create a page for your blog), Digg, StumbleUpon, Delicious etc. By the way, it’s a good practice to create a separate social site's account for each of your projects. This way you can stay focused and post messages that are related to your project. In the long run, this will help build a community that are like-minded around your project.

, This is the point at which you will benefit from some attention from the Web Spider. Start by submitting your site to the big three search engines: Google, Yahoo and Bing. To link to make things easier for you, each of these concepts is the page that you access in order to submit your site to search engines. Send your main URL for each of these search engines to get started.

, Once again it is highlighted for your convenience (you need to create a Google Account before you can use their tools). Also Sign up for Bing Webmaster Tools (you need to create a Hotmail account), while you’re at it. Bing takes longer than Google’s index pages, but it is prudent to go ahead and sign up for their tools anyway. Have Yahoo! use their own type of webmaster tools for you.

, This allows the search engines to see and to understand the link structure of your site and, more importantly allows the spiders to your site with more ease and freedom to crawl. You can easily click your own map by clicking here and filling out the necessary information.

, You now have all the work (done phew!). Is it time to start submitting your site to some web directories. I’ll go ahead and warn you that there are myriad directories on the web, but not all of them necessarily good. Do some online research first.

Make familiar comparisons.,
Consider using illustrations while explaining SEO.,
Consider using a physical example.",How to Explain SEO to Clients5," Another great way to convey new information to someone is to compare it to something he or she is familiar with. Find out what your client does or is interested in, and compare SEO to that.For example:


If your client is the manager of a lakeside hotel resort, then compare SEO to the hotel business. In this case, you could compare good reviews to good links (authority), and the things the hotel has to offer, such as a sauna and a lakeside view, to a website's content and keywords.

, Some people are visual learners, and may require some sort of illustration (such as a chart or diagram) to help understand things. For example, if you are explaining the different aspects of SEO, consider drawing a circle on a piece of paper, and labeling it with that aspect. Then, move your pen, pencil, or finger over each bubble as you talk about it.


You could also consider drawing a comic where Person A asks Person B questions about how SEO works, and Person A answers them., If you are meeting your client in person, open up a search engine and type in the terms one would use to find his or her website. For example, if your client is a residential architect, specializing in exterior design, type the words ""residential architect exterior design"" followed by the city name. If your client's website does not show up on the first page, but his or her competitor's does, he or she might then realize the importance of SEO.

Make it easy to comment.,
Interact with commenters.,
Ask for comments.,
Comment on other people's blogs.",How to Get People to Comment on Your Business Blog," If posting a comment is too difficult or time-consuming, blog readers probably won't comment even if they like your blog and want to interact. Simplify the process as much as possible, by not requiring readers to log in before posting, and by allowing comments to post immediately. Instead of moderating comments before they post, sign up for e-mail alerts so you'll know when you receive a comment. This way, you can still evaluate comments for appropriateness, and simply delete them if they're offensive or inappropriate.;
, When readers post comments, reply quickly so they know you value their input. Reply with more than a simple thank you, if possible. Follow up on the poster's comments, and engage her in a discussion about the topic. Also, highlight especially informative or engaging comments by building subsequent posts around them. If a commenter asks you a question other readers might be interested in, use the question as the basis for a blog post, either by offering your opinion, or by exploring the subject and asking other readers to respond. Often, you can get people to comment on your business blog simply by demonstrating you'll reply back to them.

, Many blog readers are ""lurkers,"" meaning they actively read blogs, but rarely comment or otherwise interact. According to Jakob Nelson of the Nielsen of the Norman Nielsen Group, 90 percent of online community members lurk, with only about 1 percent of users accounting for most of the interaction. Sometimes they're just hesitant or intimidated, because they're unsure of what kind of comments to make or how they'll be received. Or it may not even occur to them that you want comments. Often, simply asking for reader input encourages blog comments. You can ask readers for their opinion on your blog post, or to share similar experiences they've had with the subject.

, Often, if you start a discussion with other bloggers on their sites, they'll be more likely to visit your blog and comment on your posts. Their visitors may also be intrigued by your comments and visit your site, and will likely offer their input on your posts. Choose blogs in your niche, or that attract the type of reader you hope to attract to your site. This helps you tap into an audience already interested in what you have to say. Also, avoid simply posting comments like ""Great post!"" Comments like this share little about who you are or what you provide, and don't encourage conversation. Only comment if you have something to contribute to the post, whether you're sharing a similar experience or an opposing viewpoint. It's perfectly acceptable in the blogging community to disagree, provided you do it respectfully and with the intent of learning from one another, rather than just creating controversy.

Update frequently.,
Avoid excessive repetition.,
Change topics.,
Post pictures.,
Post videos.,
Talk about current events.,
Avoid being biased or offensive.",How to Entertain Your Blog Readers," The readers of your blog would like to see at least some sort of new post every now and then. Posting at least once a day can keep them satisfied, although three or four times a week could be enough if you don't have the time.;
, Never talk about the exact same thing for an extended period of time; not everyone wants to read about your new pair of shoes throughout the whole week. This shouldn't be a problem if your blog is about a certain topic but you could try to keep things interesting by changing things up whenever you can.

, Try to talk about different topics. One blog post could be about how much you love wikiHow, while the next could be about a new movie that you're eager to see. Random blogs can be quite amusing for readers because they never know what to expect - and they love that!

, Add pictures that are relevant to the theme of the blog. If you mentioned that it snowed today, why not a post a picture of you out in the snow with friends? Another example, for a fashion blog, would be posting a picture of you wearing the outfit that you wore that day. It may be even be worth talking about where you bought your clothes from and even where you went and what you did.

, Videos are a lot more entertaining than pictures or just text. Putting videos related to your topic on your blog will not only entertain people but they can also help people understand things more if you're trying to explain something.

, You can add gossip about celebs from time to time or what's going in the world of sports and athletics.

, Expressing your own opinion is fine but avoid coming across as arrogant or ignorant. Another thing to avoid are racial/religious slurs. It may be safe to avoid political or religious topics altogether unless your blog has anything to do with politics or religion - even if you aren't being offensive, some people just don't want to hear it. Making any of these mistakes just once has the potential to put people off from reading your blog completely.

If you don't remember who your current registrar is, you can look it up by performing a WHOIS search on your domain.;
, Many people use an email service that is tied to their domain. During the domain transfer process, you will likely lose access to your email service for your domain name. Make sure that you have another email account, such as a Gmail or Yahoo account, that you can use as a secondary means of communication.


Make sure to set this email as your contact email in your domain registration information.

, The process for this varies depending on the registrar you currently use, but you can typically unlock your domain from the Domain section of your domain control panel. Make this request to your current domain registrar.

, Every domain must provide you with this code within five days of your request. Some registrars allow you to generate your code in the control panel, while others will send it to your via email. You can generally request the code from the same section of the control panel that you used to unlock your domain.


You will need this code in order to transfer your domain.

, You cannot transfer your domain if it was created or transferred within the last 60 days. This is an ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) requirement, which is the organization that manages addresses on the internet., The actual process for transferring your domain will vary depending on which service you are transferring to. Make sure that you read the instructions for transferring posted on the new registrar's support pages for exact instructions.

, You will likely need to create an account with the registrar before you can access this page. You can usually find the Transfer Domain section in the control panel for your new registrar, or you may be given the option to start the process when you create your account.


You may need to contact the registrar's support staff to initiate a transfer if there is no option available on the website.

, You usually will need to pay for your domain to be transferred. Some services require that you automatically renew for an additional year when you transfer. You may be able to get a free transfer for signing up with the new registrar.

, Your new registrar will configure DNS and name servers for you once the transfer has been authorized. After the transfer has been set up by the new registrar, it can take up to a few days for your DNS changes to be recognized worldwide. Your website should still be available.


The actual process will vary depending on the registrar you choose. This may include an extra round of authentication from the new registrar. Check the support pages for the new registrar for details.

, Some domain registrars allow you to mask your domain registration information so that your contact information is not available to the general public when a WHOIS search is performed. Instead, the registrar's information will be displayed, hiding your name, phone number, address, and email. Usually, private registration costs extra.

Create a flowchart of your online museum.,
Construct your galleries.,
Add pictures to your galleries.,
Link in additional information and copies of documents.,
Keep expanding.,
Consider opening a gift shop.",How to Start a Virtual Museum," Just like in a real museum, try to imagine the home page as the lobby. Welcome visitors to the online museum and include plenty of links to the different ""galleries"" you have on display. If you can, try to include pictures with your links. This will help present a more visual and user-friendly environment.;
, As you build your web page, try to divide galleries into different ""rooms"" like you would find in a museum. Group associated concepts together. For example, if your museum is about American history, start one page for the early-colonization period, another for the revolutionary war and another for the drafting of the constitution. It may be helpful to include links to the next gallery in sequence at the bottom of the page. This will help the visitor feel more like they are in an actual museum, passing from one room to the next.

, As you program your web page, include pictures you have taken of the things in your real museum, with captions alongside them. Make sure to be descriptive with the items. For example, if you have a picture of the Hope Diamond, don't just say ""The Hope Diamond""; instead, give a short description on it, namely ""The Hope Diamond, a rare deep-blue diamond, has an extensive history which is believed to trace back to India."" If you have more information, be sure to include a link to that next to your initial explanation.

, This will give researchers and those who are just curious the opportunity to read deeper into the information presented and to see the source. Be sure to include these links next to the photos and short descriptions they pertain to. This will help satiate the visitors' curiosity and give them the means to learn even more than they might be able to in a traditional museum.

, Although your web page might start with one or two galleries, keep working on it and adding in more. Even if you do it little by little, your museum will begin to fill out and before long you will find that it is full of useful and interesting information. Remember that because your museum is online, you do not need to worry about constraints like floor space. You have the ability to do something that no other museum in the world can.

, If the page you are building is for a real museum and you have the means to do so, you may want to include a small online store where visitors can buy items available in your real museum's gift shop. This will allow the museum to collect income off the website and will allow visitors to purchase books and other information that may help them in continued research. Just be sure that your site is secure enough to process credit card information, and that you actually have the ability to ship these items to the website visitor.

Look for a website that already targets the market you want to target.,
Look for a website that is poorly optimized for generating advertising revenue.,
Look to acquire community-driven websites, blogs, and forums.,
Look for websites that are competing in your market.",How to Acquire a Website1," Acquiring a website that already targets your intended market is a great way to instantly build a customer base for your current or future products and services.


For example, if you are planning to offer your services as a writing coach, then you'd want to acquire a website whose audience is made up of new and learning writers. If you want to coach writers, it would be counterproductive to acquire a website dedicated to something like gardening.;
, Many websites have plenty of great content but fail to optimize their website for maximum traffic and ad performance. If you acquire a website like this, you can quickly implement optimizations and start generating more ad revenue for yourself.


When looking for poorly optimized sites, pay attention to their advertisement placement. Sometimes you can boost a website's ad revenue simply by moving around the ads so that they are more visible. You should also look for websites with poor keyword density and search engine optimization. By improving on that, you can drastically increase a website's visibility across search engines, thus increasing traffic and exposure.

, When a website has a large community surrounding its brand, all of those community members form a potential market for your products and services. Don't just acquire any community, though. Find a large community that would be interested in buying what you have to offer.

, If you find other websites that are trying to sell similar services or products, then you may want to acquire those websites to reduce competition. By removing the competition, you gain market dominance and you increase your stability in that market.

Browse an online website trading marketplace.,
Search the web manually.",How to Acquire a Website2," There are websites that allow website owners who wish to sell their websites to post listings. Website trading marketplaces can be very convenient for the buyer, but you most likely will not find a good bargain there.

, Using a search engine, browse for websites that fit into your intended market. Skip the big websites that are securely established, as you won't be able to buy those websites without paying a large price. Find websites that aren't too big, have a good amount of consistent content, but have yet to become extremely popular.

Research the target website.,
Contact the owner.,
Negotiate a price.,
Seal the deal.",How to Acquire a Website3," When you have your sights set on a website that you wish to buy, do a bit of research. Find out about its history. If they have a forum, check it out. If the website has statistics available, review them.


You can check into a website's history using a couple of methods. You can view a website's history of popularity by consulting the Alexa website ranking service. You can view previous versions of a website by using the Wayback Machine online service. You can view information regarding a website's domain name by performing a WHOIS lookup. All of these services are sourced below.

, If you're absolutely sure you want to purchase the website, then browse the website and find a contact email address for the owner. In the email, introduce yourself and express your liking of the site, but do not tell them yet that you're interested in buying the site. Use the first few emails to gauge the owner's interest in their own site.

, Once you've let the owner know that you want to purchase their website, you'll need to negotiate an acceptable price for both parties. Ask the owner for information regarding visitor traffic, site revenues, site costs, and other site statistics. The negotiating process can be very short or very long depending on the website owner's willingness to compromise.

, Create a contract outlining all of the points of the sale and have both parties date and sign it. It would be a good idea to have a lawyer look over the contract to verify its validity. Once the contract is signed, make the payment and have the owner transfer everything related to the site over to your name.

Create or locate an icon image to use for your favicon.,
Upload the favicon image to your web-hosting account.,
Test the favicon.",How to Add a Favicon," You can use any number of free clip art images, a smaller version of your logo, or any other image you see fit. The image you create is best saved in the .ico (Windows icon) format, as this is the only format that can be universally read across Safari, Opera, Firefox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer. The image should be no larger than 16-by-16 pixels. If the image is larger, use a photo-editing program to re-size it because the image will not work if it is larger.;
, Use either your web-based control panel and file manager or file transfer protocol (FTP) software, and note the file path to where the file was uploaded. For instance, if you uploaded the .ico file to your images directory, the full path would be: http://yourdomain.com/images/favicon.ico


Open the source code file for each page in your website, and use either your web-based control panel and file manager or the FTP software. In the head ""<head>"" section at the top of each document, insert the following code to add a favicon, starting immediately after the word ""head"": ""profile=""""> http:

To use the predetermined URL method, upload the favicon image to the main folder where your website files are without changing the source code. This method only works in browsers that were programmed to look for the URL. People who have their own websites but do not have their own domain name will not be able to use this method.
Use a favicon creator to create your favicon. These online tools will take an image you upload and size it accordingly. Some creators may also provide the code you need use to add the favicon to your website as well as instructions on how to install it.

, Load your website in the browser of your choice. If it does not work, clear your cache and try again. If it still does not work, check for code error and typos, image upload location, image type, and image size. Be sure you are using the appropriate version of the code for the language your website is written in, which is either HTML or XHTML.

,


Think about how you want to brand yourself online to your customers/clients.

,
Your website needs to be built with Search Engine Optimization practices in mind. If it isn't, you are wasting your time and money therefore only building a website that will be uploaded into the never never land of the world wide world. We all know that consumers use the internet on a frequent basis and will look for products/services via search engine channels (Main ones Google, Yahoo and MSN). If you are not listed, consumers may not trust or find you a credible source, therefore losing potential leads and sales.

Evaluate your products and services honestly.,

Determine your marketing budget.,
Evaluate your marketing options.,
Create a marketing campaign.",How to Effectively Advertise," How do they differ from the competition? What do your competitors do better? Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of what you have to offer will help you improve your business and your marketing techniques.;
, Who purchases your product or service? Where do they live? How much disposable income do they have to spend?


Compile a list of what defines your ideal customer.
You may have more than one target market. For example, a shoe store may advertise inexpensive gym shoes to parents of young children while also marketing pricey dress shoes to the business crowd.
Examine your customers and the purchases they make. Find out who is buying your product or service and create a profile for each type of customer.

, Effective advertising campaigns can be costly; you need to know how much you can realistically spend.

,


Newspapers offer a wide price range from inexpensive classified advertising to pricey full color ads.
Radio reaches a wide regional area and typically appeals to particular demographic groups.
Web site marketing offers tremendous variety from inexpensive do-it-yourself sites to high dollar, innovative technology. Web sites reach the widest audience and offer the potential for international business transactions.
Social Media is the least expensive advertising available. An investment of time to build a large social network may pay off in sales.
Direct Mail is traditional advertising that has grown with the times. Mailing lists targeted by almost any criterion you choose are available for purchase.
Email can be an effective marketing tool, but beware of strict compliance rules. Commercial email that defies the CAN-SPAM Act may incur penalties of up to $16,000 per occurrence.
Television is a powerful advertising medium, but it's often too expensive for small businesses. Small cable channels usually provide the most cost effective option for this type of advertising.

,


Write down the specific goal you intend to accomplish. (""Increase sales by 15% before the end of the fiscal year"" or ""Gain 50 new customers this month."")
Choose a medium to begin your marketing campaign. (Ex: Direct Mail)
Develop the materials you'll use in the campaign. In this example, it could be a series of letters with increasingly enticing offers for your latest product.
Determine a time frame for implementation. How often will you mail? Do the letters need to coincide with local or calendar events? Allow time for delays and test marketing. Patience is an essential; successful marketing campaigns can take a year or more of careful planning.
Test market the campaign. Before you commit extensive resources, it's wise to test the market to see how well-received your advertising will be. Testing keeps costs minimal while you hone the campaign. In a case of direct mail marketing, you might send the materials to a control group consisting of a random 5% of your mailing list.
Evaluate test marketing results. Use this information to edit the materials (or the campaign itself) as necessary. If results are unclear, consider test marketing on another control group. You need strong, consistent results in order to predict a successful campaign.

Research keywords.,
Place keywords strategically .,
Include Meta and title tags.,
Keep your content updated.,
Provide enough content.,
Use images sparingly.,
Avoid using frames if possible.,
Build incoming or back links.",How to Design a Website for SEO," When designing a search engine friendly site, carry out the research for keywords. Make effective use of a word tracker. A word tracker is a keyword research tool from which one can find relevant databases that could help one grab the attention of prospective audience. The two main things to remember are competition search and the misspelling search.;
, Researching for the keyword is a complex chore, but what holds more complexity is correct placement of researched keywords.


Place keywords in the URL. Inclusion of keywords in the URL of the website is optimal. If you have multiple words that need to be placed in the URL, then appropriately separated dashes should be used.
Focus on areas that register well with search engines, including bold headings, near the top of the page and at the end of the page.
Embed keywords in the anchor text used to describe links, your domain name and title and Meta tags.
Use keywords to create a theme throughout the content on your site. Search engines tend to look for a theme or common topic on a Website in an effort to deliver more relevant results for searchers.
Place your keywords as closely together as possible, while making sure your sentences remain clear.
Ensure a proper keyword density or weight. The greater the percentage of keywords, in relation to other text, the better.

, Some search engines still use Meta Keyword, Meta Description and Title tags to catalog and rank Web pages. Be sure to place a title tag at the top of each page to identify the document's overall content. You should also write an accurate Meta description tag. Don't neglect to include a Meta keyword tag to reveal the most important keywords for each page to search engine spiders.

, This lets search engines know the content on your site isn't stale, plus it will keep your site appealing to visitors looking for the latest information.

, Major search engines typically require you to have at least 200 to 250 words on each page.

, Apart from the logo or any other specific symbol, the text of the website should be kept away from images. The size and the placement of the image also need to be watched.

, Frames, which are being used less and less, enable you to split a page into pieces and section off static content to decrease download times. However, they can cause navigation difficulties and prevent search engines from being able to access every page on your website.

, Most major search engines rank Web pages based on the number and the quality of links that point to the Website (link popularity). They do so because it's very difficult for Web masters to ""fake"" good links. As a result, link analysis gives search engines a useful means of determining which pages are good for particular topics.


Listing your Website with relevant directories and portals is an ideal way to build valuable incoming links. You can also write articles, forum/blog posts, and testimonials and include a link pointing back to your site. In addition, you can trade links with Websites that complement yours. Just make sure they're not competing Websites. The main objective is to link to sites that are closely related to your site's topic.
Keep in mind that search engines look for websites that are useful for site visitors. If your linking structure indicates that it is helpful and informative, you'll generate more favorable search engine rankings. You'll also enjoy a steady stream of targeted traffic from your link partners.

Keep your advert title short, snappy and to the point.,
Make your advert unique.,
Be descriptive.,
Make yourself approachable.,
Do not over stuff your adverts with keywords.,
Don’t be tempted to place the same advert more than once.,
Use a good quality photograph.Your chances of a response from prospective buyers will more than double.,
Make sure you are being honest about the condition of the item.,
If you are posting your advert on more than one classified website make sure you create unique content for each and do not just copy and paste the same text.

,
Post your ad in the most relevant category.,
Tweet or bookmark your ad on different social media platforms.,
Invite prospective buyers to contact you for further information.",How to Create Unique Content and Increase Exposure of Your Classified Advert on Loot.com," Make it original to catch the eye but also make sure you are clear about what you are selling.;
, Study other ads in the category selling similar products and make yours as different as possible. Perhaps add features that another person has forgotten or change the style of writing in your advert to those of others.

, Ensure you make your advert a good length to include all important information about the product you are selling. Try to think of questions a prospective buyer would want to know about your product and provide answers in your description.

, Create a happy, friendly or even humorous manner within your advert text. This will help engage the audience and make the prospective buyers chose your ads over all the others.

, Repetitive use of the same words will not increase the chances of people finding your ad. In fact, quite the opposite. Organic search engines will not display content that isn’t of good quality so your advert for a puppy which includes the word ‘German Shepherd’ ten times is unlikely to be displayed.

, As above, Google and other search engines hate duplicate content. They will read your advert as spam and will not present it at the top of their rankings. Spamming also brings down your reputation as a seller. People will be reluctant to engage with spammers or take them seriously. One advert with quality and unique content will bring you better traffic and business than hundreds of adverts with the same or similar content. Do not take short cuts. Take the time to create something original.

, You can place up to 10 photos for each ad on Loot.com and BargainPages.co.uk.

, Misleading information wastes everyone’s time including your own.

,, Your advert for photographic services will not be easily found amongst a hundred adverts for second hand cameras for sale.

, This will increase the reach and influence of your advertisement. For business it will increase your brand’s awareness and help engage different audiences.

, Always be willing to honestly answer questions about what you are selling or the services your business offers. This is your chance to really sell your product or service and list all the features and benefits for the interested party.

Decide if your website fulfills its purpose.,
Assess whether your website has the right content.,
Assess whether using your website is a good experience for your audience / customers.,
Assess whether your website looks good, and whether it shows off your brand.,
Assess whether your website is easy (enough) for you to update?,
Assess whether your website has been developed and optimised properly.,
Assess whether you are using your website well.",How to Determine How Good Your Website Is," This may sound obvious, but it’s probably not that easy to answer, because websites can be incredibly complex, and we have them for many different reasons. Typically websites are used for communication (between you and your audience / customers / clients); this should be two-way communication – from you, and back to you (called engagement).


You may have a website to tell the world (or at least people who know you) about yourself and what you do, or about your business and what it sells, or about your organisation and what it strives for.
More than just to tell, you want to motivate your audience / customers to physically do something, whether it’s simply to contact you, or to order / buy from you, or to do good in the world.

This is called a call-to-action, and should be what you measure the success of your website against.

;
, This one’s all about you, or the person who creates your website’s content. The content is what makes a website worth having in the first place, so it’s the most important thing to think about; regularly!


Even if your content is terrible, however, this will not mean you need a new website, it means you need to spend time working on the content.
Keep in mind that your website may have 2 kinds of content; the information about you / your business / your products and services – this probably won’t change often; and new fresh content, usually in the form or news or a blog – this should be updated often.

, To be a good experience for them, it should be easy to navigate from one page to another (and within a webpage sometimes), easy to find what they’re looking for, and possibly provide them with content they weren’t even looking for but is relevant to them at the time. This is called UX (user experience).

, Wisdom in the web-design industry says that ‘great web design makes the visitor focus on the content’; this means that although you may want your website to look amazing, it’s more important that it looks great because of the way it shows off the content.


Pay special attention to the details, like the size of the text, the borders around buttons, and the spacing between everything; these little details are often the different between great design and poor design.

,
There’s not much point in a website that appears great, but is always out of date because you can’t update the content, or because you don’t want to.


Either the website should be designed in a way that helps you update it, or the person maintaining the website must do this for you without any fuss.
If your website is built using a content management system (a CMS) such as Wordpress, make sure you have a user account that lets you log in to make the changes you should be able to make.

, There are an incredible number of little things that can improve or damage the quality of the experience of using your website.


Some of these things include elimination of software bugs, fast webpage loading speeds, easy-to-read URLs (webpage addresses), an effective search feature, the ability to display the content on any screen size (responsiveness), and many more.

To understand this better, it might be a good idea to read up about website standards and website optimisation.


To ensure people find you when they search, check that your website is properly search engine-optimised (SEO). You’ll need to make sure the website itself is well SEO’ed (on-site SEO), and that there are many good-quality links pointing to your website (off-site SEO).

, For an individual, your website might be to provide information about you or your activities. You probably have friends, family, colleges, and acquaintances who should know about your website


Make sure they do, and get feedback from them about improving it.
For a business or organization, your website should be part of your marketing strategy, and the core of your online-marketing strategy.
If your business has a presence on any other form of online media (an email newsletter, social media, a blog, a forum, etc.), make sure people can follow your business’ presence in all these places to engage with it and become a community.

, You might be getting readers visiting for all the wrong reasons and who are quickly disappointed when they see what your site does contain. This can happen where you haven't described things well, where you have mislead people (not necessarily intentionally) into thinking that your site offers something other than what it does. Things to keep in mind include:


Having apt and relevant titles to your site materials, articles, information, etc.
Using keywords that are relevant to your site rather than very general and ""could-be-any-site"" type.

, Get a friend to have a look at it and give you constructive feedback. Does your opening page:


Feel inviting?
Appear engaging?
Offer all the necessary tools at once, such as joining information, search information, good introductory information?

, Is it able to keep a reader? Be very honest about this aspect. If your site is full of rehashed, repetitive information that teaches a reader nothing new, or fails to provide interesting insights that engage the reader fully, you won't keep your readers interested.


If you are selling things, are your descriptions of the product or services complete, adequate, and engaging?
If you are offering reading matter, are you adding new and interesting angles that the reader hasn't yet being exposed to?
If you are offering things to do, such as games, etc., are these good quality, interesting, and better than those offered by competing websites?

, Can your readers get around your site with ease or is it like finding a needle-in-a-haystack to get any useful content out? Some things to consider include:


Weave in lots of links to make sure that readers move smoothly through your site.
Provide easy menus or lists for readers to find information quickly.
Avoid creating a sense of ""those-in-the-know-know-where-to-go"". Ask yourself would you bother finding things out if you felt that about a website's attitude to navigating around it?
Fix up shoddy internal search engines.
Decent font sizes. Not everyone on the internet is under the age of 25. Don't hide what matters. Equally, don't make it hard to find - what you feel is intuitively obvious should be tested on a wider research group than your intuition.

Select a blog host.,
Determine how much control you want control over your URL.",How to Create a Personal Blog2," A host is a website whose blogging platform you'll use in order to start blogging. With the rise of the internet, dozens of blogging hosts have risen to prominence, many of them easy to use for people who know next to nothing about computers. There are plentyof free hosts in addition to hosts for which you need to pay. Here are a list of just a few:


Free blog hosts:
Wordpress.com
Blogger
Tumblr
SimpleSite


Blog hosts with fees:
GoDaddy
Bluehost
HostGator
Hostmonster



, If you use a free blogging platform, your URL is going to look something like this:www.myblog.wordpress.com/

If you intend for your blog to be strictly personal, and you don't anticipate the need to build your own brand or start reaching out to other bloggers, a free web hosting service will do you fine. If, however, you believe that you may want to show your blog to other people and build your online presence at some point in the future, a paid hosting service will allow you to create a blog with a distinct and personalized URL.In that case, your URL can look like thiswww.alittlebitofblog.com


Know the differences between free hosting services and paid hosting services. Mainly, paid hosting services offer much more control over the look of the website design, as well as offering more web tools with which to personalize blogs (plugins, widgets, buttons, etc.). Although the amateur blogger probably won't need a paid hosting service, it's useful to know what you can and can't do with a free platform:






Generally, free hosting services offer a few basic pre-made templates for bloggers to choose from when designing the look of the website. Paid hosting services generally offer a greater variety of templates to choose from, as well as giving the blogger the option of designing the look of the website from the bottom up.
The biggest misconception with Wordpress. Wordpress.com and Wordpress.org are different platforms that both provide the same purpose. They are both powered with Wordpress but with Wordpress.com your site will be hosted by the company vs. with Wordpress.org which you are hosting your self.
Certain plugins are available only to people who pay for hosting services. A plugin is a tool that bloggers use to customize their blog. (A rotating tab, for example, is a cool plugin that allows viewers to see more of your content on tabbed panels.)Countless other plugins exist for paid hosting services.

This seems to be the bottom line: If you're just interested in creating a vehicle for your thoughts, these bells and whistles are probably superfluous. If, however, you take pride in the design of your website and like the idea of creating different tools for potential viewers to someday interact with, having more power to customize your weblog may be a good decision.
Get familiar with the ins and outs of whatever hosting service you decide to use. How do you italicize a title? How will you create an outbound link to another website? These are questions that you'll ask yourself as you start blogging. Although your familiarity with your blogging platform will increase the more you blog, it's important to explore the different options you have with your blog. You often don't know what is possible until you try it.






Some blogs offer an interactive video or slideshow to new users. If such a video or slideshow exists on your new blogging platform, be sure to watch it. These tutorials are packed with useful tips and hints, and will get you blogging faster and better.

Design the look of your blog.,
Look for a ""keep private"" check box within the options setting of your blog server.,
Design your blog for simple navigation.,
Create your first blog post.",How to Create a Personal Blog3," Every time you log in to your blog, the design of it ideally should motivate you to write. For some people, a simple write background, mimicking a blank page, sets the heart aflutter. For others, an intricate houndstooth pattern does the trick. How do you want your blog to look?


Choose a simple background over a loud and in-your-face one, although do what pleases you most. Here are some ideas for simple backgrounds you can mull over:
A photograph of you and your family on vacation
A simple, unobtrusive pattern that provides texture but doesn't take away from the words
A map of picture of a map
A writing object, such as a fountain pen, typewriter, or ream of paper
A simple background in your favorite color



, If you want your blog to be personal and de-indexed from search results, so that only you see it, check this option. In many blogs, there is also an option which allows you to keep your blog entirely private, where a password is required to access it. Look for this option if you want your blog to be truly secret.

, If you make categories into which you place your blog posts, try ordering the categories by popularity. Why put the blog post you visit least right up there at the top, and the blog post you visit most near the bottom? Design with simple navigation in mind.


Reduce the clutter. Just because you have the option of creating dozens of plugins and widgets doesn't mean you need to use them. If this blog is indeed about you and your thoughts, make them stand out instead of extraneous stuff.

, In many public blogs, your first post is a short explanation of who you are (some secrets are kept) and why you decided to blog. It's an online introduction of sorts. Because you're building a personal blog, however, you need not be so formal in your first post.


Write about what motivated you to start a blog. It may help to put things into writing. This is often a cathartic act, too, releasing certain tensions and stress. Try it on for size and see how it feels.
Write about what you intended to write about. Jump right in. Your blog can turn into a diary of sorts, or it can be a place where you gather interesting articles from around the web and comment on them. Of course, it can be anything in between. Write or post about what makes you happy.

"
"
Try to blog every day.,
Keep posts short.,
Use first letters of names when writing about others to maintain anonymity.,
Be truthful.,
Learn from your posts.,
Interact with your community of readers and commentors.,
Share your writing with close friends and family.",How to Create a Personal Blog4," Even if nothing of note has transpired, it's important to set aside time to blog. Getting in the rhythm of blogging can be difficult, but pretty soon you'll be doing it by instinct: Like the first day of school, it may be a bit awkward at first, but you soon make friends and grow comfortable in your new environment.


Think about special themed days when posting. If you wanted, for example, you could have ""Maniac Mondays,"" where each Monday, you blog about one person whose crazy ideas changed the world. This lends your blog some structure and helps keep you writing, even when you're not exactly sure what to write about.

, If you're having trouble writing, keep your blog posts short. A blog can be different from a diary, expose, or news article. It's meant to be digested quickly, to offer interlocking pieces of evidence and tie them together concisely. Keep these three guidelines in mind when you start blogging:


A blog can be a place for reading. Jot things down quickly rather than write extended essays on them. A ""Hey, look at this!"" seems to be a lot more effective in blog form than a ""And these are all the reasons why I'm better than you.""
Use links. Link out to other interesting pieces of content out on the web. For one, it will help you remember interesting sites that you stumble across. Second, it will save you the time to paraphrase what's going on — unless that's what you're trying to do!
Revisit old themes. Just because you've already written a blog doesn't mean you need to file it away in a musty place. Revisit your feelings about that article in a new article, for example.

, For example, ""E made me very mad today; I've had it up to here with his selfishness."" This ensures that no feelings will be hurt should someone stumble upon your blog.

, Feelings do not always make sense! Fortunately, they don't have to. All that matters is that your emotions end up blogged rather than expressed as an ulcer. Remember that your blog exists only as an outlet for you. You don't have to worry about pleasing other people if you don't want to.


Often, you'll find that writing about something helps you understand it. So even if you don't quite understand it yet, being truthful about it can help you figure it out. Writing is an act of self-discovery. If you're truthful when you write, you're sure to discover things about yourself that you didn't know about.

, Once you have blogged for a while, go back and review. Have you learned the sources of stress in your life? Can you identify any running themes? Is a particular person toxic to your emotional health?

, Even if you are anonymous, your blog may still be enjoyed by readers and commentors. Often, they leave a comment underneath your article expressing praise, opinions, or questions. Successful bloggers understand that interacting with these fans of your work is an important part of spurring readership.Respond to most, not all, comments. Often, a reader will leave a comment urging you to keep on writing. A simple ""Thank you, appreciated,"" might be a good way to respond. Other times, people will ramble off-topic or express very controversial opinions. It is not necessary to respond to each and every one of your commenters if you don't wish to.Include a call to action at the end of a post (optional). Obviously, if you don't intend to show your blog to other people, a call to action is unnecessary. But if you enjoy the thought of soliciting the opinion of your readers, include something like ""What was your favorite Christmas present?"" or ""What do you think about the Federal stimulus?"" in an appropriately themed post.

, The people closest to you care about your thoughts and feelings. Although you've probably started a personal blog as a placeholder for your own thoughts and emotions, it can be powerful to share those experiences with other people. What you're doing is starting a conversation, and conversation can be enlightening, uplifting, and powerful.

For example, maybe you've just been given a diagnosis of cancer and decided to start a blog to document your journey. You only intended for it to be seen by you. But what you grew to understand as you started writing was that sharing your deepest fears and desires actually brought you closer to the people around you; it made you more human. Sharing this realization with your close friends and family can be incredibly freeing.

, Typepad, Blogger, Movable Type, and numerous others are all available as well, so shop around and look for the one that best fits your needs.

, Develop a writing style and goal for your blog. As a business the most important aspect of your blog is that it speaks with a singular voice/personality. Your choice of writing style will reflect how readers perceive and respond to your content and (if done correctly) will establish a deeper connection to your customers.


This personality can take many forms and for most businesses originates from their core values. If your company is fun and outgoing you may chose to WRITE KEY PHRASES IN ALL CAPS to emphasize the energy or excitement they express. you may write in all lowercase letters to identify with a younger audience that has grown up with text messaging. And so on.

,, It is more than 1 in about 90% of the cases. No matter how small your business.

, Set realistic goals for how often your team will be able to post. Don't commit to writing once a day if you lack the time. Instead write every two days or once a week.

, People will get bored quickly with your business blog if it is just big blocks of text. Add images and videos so there is something on each post that will catch the eye.

, Utilize SEO so users searching specific keywords in Google or Yahoo will find your blog easily.

, Make sure you post the RSS image icon and link where your customers can see it so they can subscribe in their feed reader. Also include an option for email, so customers can be alerted through email that there is a new post. You can also create a Facebook page where they can follow you for updates.

, Most people, when visiting a blog for the first time, want to know about who is writing what they are reading. Create an About page that talks about both you and your business. Include your mission statement and the company history.

, Most of us won't be an overnight blogging sensation. Building a consistent stream of traffic takes time and commitment, but once its established your visitors will be a self perpetuating network of 'a friend of a friend.' Once you start you'll find that subject matter will gradually become easier.

, Ask for specifics, case studies and references.

, This can help you decide how to speak and dress for your videos.

, Some ""professional"" video bloggers spend hundreds on cameras and microphones, while many people use nothing more than the video recorder function on their digital cameras. Use what you have, especially in the beginning.

, The script shouldn't be set in stone - feel free to improvise a bit while recording. Also, you should know your material well enough that the script is for learning, not for reading from on camera.

, Make adjustments on lighting and the background. Some people use no background for their vlogs, while others put up a solid colored sheet to keep attention on themselves.

, Most people don't want to see you in your holey sweats and sweaty t-shirt.

, If you have a lot of gear to run, it may be necessary to ask a friend or two for help. Record several takes.

, Although this is an optional step, it can greatly improve the look of your vlog. Titles, credits, music, and random effects can be added with even simple software such a the Windows Movie Maker or the Moon Valley Soft Video Blog Pack. If you have a Mac, iMovie is a great starter video editing program (it comes on every new Mac, so most people should already have it). When you're ready to go more professional and willing to spend more money, programs like Final Cut Pro are out there as well.

, The advantage is that you have much more administrative control with it and much more flexibility.

, This is only necessary if you are creating your own blog on your own website.

, Basically, a server will be the place that your blog/domain calls home. Depending on who you know and what you find, this can cost a minimal amount per month, or be a yearly cost, or be free.

, You will need to have an account there for you to get the information that you will put on your domain once you have acquired it.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Site Statistics
Formatting tools

If your blog is about books, you might choose something like ""The Book Blog."" Taglines, descriptions of your blog, are also important. They tell people what exactly your blog is about.
, Keep your computer organized with the various bookmarks and folders needed to keep up with all of the blogs and sites you wish to keep track of or follow. Make regular comments on them, whenever you have valuable input.

, Everyday chores such as vacuuming and washing dishes are something everyone does. Most readers aren't going to be interested in reading about these chores. Of course, if you can present a unique spin on doing chores, go for it. Choose topics that you know people want to read about, because they are interested in them. Your goal is to have a unique idea that will cause people to come to your blog and stay.

, Do you believe in the idea that a photo can tell a story more effectively than words? This is extremely true in writing a blog. Pictures you post can show more than your words can portray. For this reason, you should include as many images as you can within your blog.

, You will find that people find a way to criticize posts about any topic. Constructive criticism is a great way to see where a blog is lacking. Any that don't offer something of value, you should reply to let them know you've read it and forget about it. This will demonstrate that you are a mature blogger, which will positively affect your readership.

, Sites like Facebook and Twitter, among others, will give you a big advantage and add to your recognition, credibility and popularity as a writer. These portals give you multiple options to reach out and communicate with your readers and draw more followers in.

, Include the goal of using your blog to accumulate email addresses for a mailing list. This list can make you lots of money down the road. You may regret not starting your mailing list if you wait until a later time.

, Do not overlook the power of social media as the latest and best way on the internet of connecting you with the people you want reading your blog. If you want your blog to be a success, you have to post your articles to places like Twitter and Facebook.

, These are called pingbacks and automatically leave a comment on the post you linked to along with a link to your blog. Other people will click on it and check out your blog., The above advice offers several proven ways for increasing the audience, and by extension, the success of your blog.

Research their experience.The web has seen many changes over a short period of time.",How to Choose a Website Design Agency," It is a great idea to check for the work portfolio, case studies and client testimonials of the web design companies you are considering. Are you familiar with any of the company names mentioned in their clients’ section? Google them and study their websites.


Do you like the website design that their website designers have created? Apart from the look and feel also see if the layout is user-friendly. You can also ask yourself if the design reflects the brand of the company.;
, You can further contact these companies by phone or email and inquire if they would be willing to send you references and testimonials from customers.


When they give, make sure to check them out. Call up the clients and check whether these testimonials are genuine.

,

But ultimately, the website design agency should provide you a single point of contact with whom you can discuss your requirements, seek updates and refer to for any clarification.






Ensure that the company provides you a dedicated resource so that there is no gap in communication and that your website design is completed within time and budget.







, As a rule, you should find a website design agency that reflects the requirement of your project. If your requirements are reasonably low, an agency with 5 to 10 employees should meet your purpose.

, In fact, the only constant in the online world is change. If the agency has been in the business for many years, it shows that it has managed well. The Internet has been the bane and boon for many companies – those who have survived are obviously running well and have on their payrolls website designers who are experts in their field.

Before and After testing has you track visitor traffic and behavior on a web page. After making a change to the web page in some way, you continue tracking statistics to see if the web page's performance improved.
A/B testing is a controlled form of testing that may not take long to prepare before being run. In this test, you divide visitor traffic between 2 or more web pages and see which page gets the highest number of conversions.
Multivariate testing splits a web page into sections to test 1 section at a time. Different versions of each section's content are tested to see which performs the best. This type of testing may lead to high conversion rates but needs more technical work, time, and traffic than A/B testing requires.
Segmented testing, also known as personalized or experiential testing, is the most sophisticated form of testing that uses the most time, technical effort and resources. It may be performed if you have improved your website as much as possible through A/B and multivariate testing and still wish to increase your conversions.

, Areas that you may want to focus on for optimization purposes include web page titles, images, layout of content, your selling points, and the benefits or incentives to visitors for making your desired conversion.


Consider changing the length of a title to see whether a shorter or longer title is more effective. Test rephrasing the title as a question or statement, making the tone more or less formal, or choosing a different point to emphasize.
See how traffic and conversions change if your web page images are made bigger or smaller, if photos replace illustrations or vice versa, and the use of customer images is compared to using product images.
Experiment with your website's layout, such as making it a single or multi-column layout. You can also try adding written content or reducing the amount of content your visitors need to read.
Highlight different types of selling points. Compare quality to convenience, making money to saving it, and product features to customer service.
Try pointing out different benefits or advantages to customers who make a conversion. Consider focusing on free shipping instead of a money back guarantee, for example. You can also measure whether taking orders by telephone does better or worse than receiving orders through an online form.

, Pick a page that has high traffic but does not get many conversions or otherwise performs poorly.


Look at the web page from a customer's or visitor's point of view. Determine the 3 most important issues that need fixing and possible solutions for those issues.
Consult with others, if possible, to brainstorm different content ideas to test.
Manage your own and others' expectations for this first test. You may need to change the testing process or conduct more tests before seeing any results.

, Remove any bugs in the code or spelling errors you find.

, Links that do not work, called broken links, may drive visitors to leave your site or prevent them from making a conversion.

, Meta tags are words or phrases embedded in HTML tags to describe that page and help search engines return the page address in its results.


Inspect another web site's meta tags by selecting ""View Source"" from your browser's ""View"" menu or after right-clicking the web page. This will help you see the HTML code. Look for a section near the top that contains ""meta name"". The keywords are listed there as text to be used by search engines.

, Check that your website or web pages appear in the results from each search engine. If don't, submit your site using the search engine's submission instructions.

, Offer to link to their site in return. This should increase your link popularity, a factor that may be used in determining where your web site falls in search result rankings.

Write down the goals for your company's blog.,
Identify your audience.,
Track down the concerns of your readers and match these with possible solutions using your company's products or services.,
Focus on putting across a caring and sensible message.,
Interact with your followers.",How to Choose the Right Topic for Your Business Blog," Setting your objectives is the first step towards knowing the direction of your post. It can help you narrow down your general ideas and choose the most relevant ones that are also aligned with your interests. It's important to match your interests with your goals to ensure your blog's relevance and longevity.

What do you hope to achieve for the business through use of a blog?
What sorts of stories and posts will you share on a regular basis? Will you mix tales about how your company is progressing with instructional content on using your products or services? Will you share anecdotes or human interest stories? Will you write about the readers personal concerns and offer advice?
Is community service going to be a part of your brand? Do you want to provide updates about donations, volunteering, assistance overseas or sending of care packages, and so forth?
Who will be the face of the blog? The CEO, marketing, staff writers or even handpicked customers?
Will you run competitions, quizzes and reader stories as part of the blog?;
, Knowing your niche market is vital in researching and writing about what they want to read. This means getting information beyond their age brackets and financial capabilities. Identify their consumer behavior and various preferences that can help you determine the right blogging topics to write about in order to connect with them. It also helps to stop viewing them as consumers and to think of them as people like you, people with wants, hopes, desires, dreams and needs. In what ways can your company meet just a small portion of such needs or wants?, The main purpose of having a blog is to promote your business to your target market. So, you must know what they would most likely search for on the Internet that is likely to also send the readers to your website. Your blog should provide value to your target readers, such as posting articles that are interesting, informative and address their main concerns directly and without nonsense or puff., Creating a central theme can help in getting your audience to relate with your brand on an intimate level. Having a blog that carries a consistent theme helps your readers to think of your brand when they come across topics that they need to learn about, motivating them to visit your blog. Keep your posts consistent to make your brand and its message complement each other.

If, for instance, you had a call center business, you could use customer service as your recurring topic. If you had a juice business, you could use recipes as your recurring topic, or health tips. If you had a farm tractor business, you could use tractor repairs and maintenance as recurring themes.

, It's not enough to just hand out your company wisdom, know-how and suggestions. It is also important to interact with those reading the blog, to treat them as valuable sources of spreading the message that your company is interested in its customers as people. Talk to those who leave comments and thank them for their ideas, suggestions and feedback. Even the negative comments provide a platform from which to thank them for feedback and to show how well you handle complaints as a company.

Be sure to train all of those who run the blog with proper handling of comments and complaints.
Run competitions for readers to get involved in. Your products or services make wonderful prizes and a great incentive for readers to spread the word about your company's actions through social media. Try to link some competitions with rewards for sharing the links elsewhere too.

Siri uses Bing for her web searching and train/airport info, and can say the data so you don't need to look at your phone..
Cortana relies on Bing for searching as well so her results would follow those of Bing. She can also say the data out loud.

,


Google now doesn't have a character at all and is basically an audible version of Google.
Siri is a bit astute, formal and ""addicted"" to her job. She will give you your info with just a tad of humor sometimes.
Cortana is midway between Google and Siri in that she has a personality that isn't stiff like Siri, plus she has Bing as her backbone and a video game namesake, so she has info and wit.

Search for blogs with similar topics on WordPress.com.",How to Use SEO to Optimize a Wordpress Blog," A tag cloud is a group of keywords that identifies the topics of your posts. This makes it easier for people to search and find your post on the internet. When you write a post, add tags to your post on the bottom of the ""Add New Post"" page.


The tag cloud associated with your blog is a list of words arranged in a square or ""cloud"" form. The largest words are the words used most frequently to find your post. You can get the tag cloud by going to the Appearance portion of your Dashboard, or by downloading the tag cloud plugin at WordPress.org.
Choose categories for your post, or add the ""category cloud"" widget. This is similar to adding tags. Attach categories to your posts, so people searching for their favorite blog categories (such as fitness, crafts, cooking, etc.) will find your posts more easily.;
, This means the links do not change when you update your blog. You can check by looking at the URLs of your posts. If your blog address is followed by the title, or ""/%posttitle%/"", then you are already using permalinks.

, Make sure your heading is not larger than an ""h1"" size. Place ""h1"", enclosed by the less than and greater than symbols (< >), at the front of your heading, and ""/h1"", enclosed by the less than and greater than symbols, at the end of the heading.


You can enlarge the size of your heading by replacing the ""h1"" with ""h2"" or ""h3."" Most SEO analysts recommend the smaller size (h1) for headings, because it helps you to be listed higher. Others suggest using ""h3"" to make the headline stand out on your blog, making it more attractive to readers. Some themes automatically set the size of your coding, so you may want to experiment with heading size.

, Google and other Internet search engines rank articles in accordance with the frequency of popular keywords at the beginning of headings and titles. Make titles short, keyword-friendly and memorable.

, Add the Twitter, Goodreads and RSS links widgets on WordPress.com or download plugins at WordPress.org. Post your new blog articles on these social media channels, to increase the number of links to your blog.


Research has found that the more links to your posts on other sites or blogs, the more likely your posts are to be listed at the top of search engines.

, You may need help from a web programmer to learn to use the plugin correctly. This SEO plugin automates ways that can help your page rank higher on search engines.

, Meta descriptions pop up under your site name on Search engines. Make sure every description is 1 to 3 sentences long, unique for each post and intriguing.


A meta description is an ""elevator pitch"" for each blog post. Tell your audience in a few short sentences why they should read your post above those of all others.

, Improve content to keep your blog active and give readers what they want. You can either improve a post by editing an old one, or add a new post that links back (or redirects) to an old post.

, Sites are judged by search engines by how current they are, which is why it is important to post consistently on your site. Consistent reader comments also keep the blog current.


Post links to the comments section of your blog on your social media accounts. This link will also help to keep your article active and listed at the top of search engines.

, The best use usage of the WordPress SEO is to turn new readers into subscribers. You will know your SEO is working when you get more subscribers. In your posts, don't be afraid to ask your readers to subscribe.

, Post comments on their blogs to encourage communication between blogs. Belonging to a community will increase referrals to your blog or posts, making your blog URL appear more often on the Internet.

Remove pre-conceived notions that consumers use proper sentence structure or other grammar rules to find results. More often than not, search terms (keywords) are simply a list of words that they would like included in the results that show up, such as ""blue bike women's."";
, Sit down with a marketing team and come up with the terms that apply to your products or content.

, Take down approximately 20 to 40 keyword combinations to research. These should be combinations of 2 to 4 words.


Longer combinations of keywords are called ""long tail keywords."" They are used by consumers for more accurate results; however, they are searched less often than shorter ""head"" keywords.
Using Excel or another spreadsheet program to keep your keywords can help you keep long-term results on their value to your search engine optimization process.

, You can fill these out as you move through the process.

,


Take your Excel list. Begin typing each term into Google, 1 at a time. Do not press ""Search"" right away. Wait until the auto-complete function kicks in.
Wait until other suggested words pop up next to the terms you typed in. These are long tail keywords that people have actually typed into Google.
Write down these long tail keywords on your keyword brainstorm list.

, Type in each of the terms on your list. Find out the similar search terms with the best page rank on search engines. List these head and long tail keywords on your final keyword list.


Create another sheet in your Excel document. List the keywords that pass your research tests for value and efficacy.

, Any professional website should track the organic search results that bring traffic to the site.


If you do not know how to find them, ask your web programmer to email a list of terms, how many clicks they provided and their conversion rates.
If you do not have a built-in analytics program, you should sign up for a free Google Analytics account. By installing a tracking link on your website, you will start to gather data about the origins of your web traffic.

, Choose those with the highest conversion rates for preference with PPC ads.


This research will also tell you which search engines your customers are using. You should take out PPC ads with the sites that give you the most traffic with the highest conversion rates.

, These are the 1-word keywords that most generically describe what you sell or post.


For example, if you run a political campaign, ""politics,"" ""senator"" and ""election"" are probably not worth buying in a pay per click environment.
In addition, unless you have a marketing department with a lot of money, it will be difficult to bid high enough to have your search results ranked highly against large corporations. You will get better value targeting your keywords. For example, choose ""New Jersey Senator"" over ""Senator.""

, Even if these terms seem obscure, most people use more than 1 word to find results in search engines.

, Test several words along with them to increase the targeted nature of the keywords. For example, ""nature"" is far too broad, but ""Yosemite nature hikes"" adds value to your keywords.

, If you have done research and the specific long tail keyword gets a horrible page ranking, it should not be used for any PPC ads, and it is probably not a good choice for an image name, meta description, URL or article title.

, These should be terms that come from your analytics and test well on WordStream. Rank them according to their perceived value according to your research.

, Google Adwords and Microsoft AdCenter are user-friendly PPC ads for first time users.


Bid on the top 5 keywords on your list. Keep in mind that the shorter and more generic these keywords are, the more expensive your bid per click will need to be.

, Look at the number of clicks, the number of sales and the conversion rate to identify the value within 2 weeks of starting the ad.


Stop pay per click ads that give you little traffic and few sales. Mark this down on your keyword list as a keyword that is either too expensive to bid on or 1 that gives poor results.
Keep PPC ads that achieve high conversion rates. Even if you are getting fewer clicks than with general terms, you only pay per click. If you have a high number of sales per click, you are likely to get value from the ad.
Take out new PPC ads with new keywords to test them. Do this until you find the right keywords that are working for your site.

, Hire an SEO consultant if you do not know how to change the URLs, image names, meta descriptions and links on your website.


Use the most valuable keywords, from research and PPC testing, to your meta tags and meta descriptions. Do this individually for each post and product.
Hire an SEO writer to create high-quality content for your website. Ask the writer to include your most valuable keywords and keyword combinations in the title, subtitle, subheadings and article. Make sure there is a higher concentration of keywords near the beginning.
Simplify URL addresses and image names to include addresses. Easy URLs will appear more readily on search results. Optimized image names will appear on special searches, like Google Images.
Create backlinks. Post your website content, with descriptions that contain keywords on social media accounts, blogs, blog comments and in article directories.

, Compare these results to the baselines that you gathered to find organic search words to see if your keywords are increasing your SEO.

Complete updates.,
Do regular cleanups.",How to Speed Up WordPress," Do this by checking the loading time yourself from different computers and using different browsers. Borrow a friend's computer and visit your neighbor's computer too, to see what is happening elsewhere.;
, Calculate the time it takes to load completely. If it takes more than 5 seconds, continue with the below steps. If not, your blog has a good speed already and you're good to carry on as usual.

, A good web host is worth the money spent. You will have a better loading time and good access to help if there are any problems. Research your hosting provider. Do a bit of research on different hosting companies and learn about their response time and customer support before you make your choice or shift to a new one.

, A WordPress website sometimes takes more time to load because of its template. The template could have lots of graphics or bulky code that make it heavy. Choose a simple theme instead if you are experiencing slow loading. Select a theme with a built-in portfolio functionality.


A theme should display and style your content, whereas a plugin can be used to add functionality. Instead of going for premium themes, such as ThemeForest and Mojo themes, start with a free default WordPress theme and add features and styles along the way as you discover a need for them.
Show only around four to five posts on the home page.

, A caching plugin can reduce a WordPress database call and makes WordPress faster. Use W3TC or WP super cache. However, do watch your plugin usage. Delete the plugins you do not require, as every badly coded plugin (even a deactivated one) poses a security threat. Select only the plugins you need and regularly update them.


While using cache plugins can speed up your WordPress, spend some time figuring out what’s working and what’s not. The most popular ones are WP Super Cache and W3 Total Cache.
Do not enable everything. Do it just for the basic things, such as page cache, browser cache, minimize, or try enabling the CDN option.

, Uncompressed and non-optimized images can massively slow down websites. You can avoid this by: Optimizing your images before you upload them & crop them. Use Wp Smush.it., it is a plugin that compresses your images


Avoid image based advertisements. Advertisements can be text, image, or java-script based. Go for the text or link option to prevent slow loading ads. If you are still keen on using images, see if you can host them yourself.
Host videos externally. Host videos on Youtube or any video hosting provider to remove strain from your server.

, Create a backup. If you use WordPress products created with WordPress – updating your WordPress installation, WordPress theme, and plugins can be effortless. Every update brings better performance and functionality improvements with it.

, Keep the site as clean as possible so that it runs well. Some of the things you might try include:


Optimize your data base to remove junk from it. Use the WP optimize plugin for automating this task.

A good backup is key to being able to edit theme files without worries. If you mess up even one line of code, you will need to restore that file from your backup.;
,


Try not to choose the wordpress theme editor. It is generally not a good idea, since all changes are made to your website live and there is no undo option. So, if you do something wrong, you can't fix it, and you’re in a world of trouble.

A better thing to do would be to download the file to your PC and use a code editor on your pc. Once you are done, upload the file via FTP.



, Due to the abundance of wordpress themes out there, it is impossible to pinpoint where the footer link will be located. It is in a different place for each theme.

, Is there a file named credits.php? or class-credits.php ? Look for these hints. Look also in the footer.php file or in class-main-footer.php. You can also try searching your theme for the keyword credits. Once you have located the file, you can proceed to the next step.

, Once you have located that elusive footer link, all that is left if either changing it or removing it. In the file, locate the footer link text. It will be wrapped in a lot of php code so be careful not to edit any of the code.


Only edit the text variable or remove it completely. For example, if the code looks like what is shown in the picture, change or remove references to the theme maker.


,


Go to your website. Does it display correctly? Does it display at all? Is the footer link gone? If yes, congrats! You have successfully removed that annoying footer link. Give yourself a clap on the back for a job well done.

However, if you didn't succeed, restore your backup and try again.

, Blogspot and Wordpress are blogging sites that provide free blog access. These sites offer easy to follow instructions on how to get started and creative templates to use to express your unique writing style and personality. A blog is a great to way to get a buzz going about your latest writing project or topic. For example, an author who's writing on ""Bullying"" created a blog that delved into the topic on a more personal note as she shared some of the experiences of her son.


Blogging is also a great way to practice your writing and create a following. The easiest way to start is to write on something that you really care about or is easy for you to get excited about. You can also consider a need that you had trouble getting met and write about how you met that need in your own life and best practices on how others can meet that need in their own lives.
Blogging also is a great way to raise your internet ratings. The more things you have online, for example, Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, website, etc., the  more people can find you and your writing.

, As you build your platform, you can include the link to your new blog on your personal FB page, Author's page and Group page. Encourage your Facebook family to start following you on your blog.

, Become a contributor to an online magazine, join a writing community like wikiHow, offer to speak pro bono on your writing topic, hold a free workshop of your topic at the library. For example, Dale Carnegie could have held a ""How To Win Friends And Influence People' seminar that would have provided exposure to his book.

, If you are a writer who enjoys speaking, BlogSpot Radio is another free way to build your writing platform and internet exposure.

, If you have self-published a book or will soon do so, create a book website to market your book and get your name out there. Homestead.com and similar companies offer free trials and their software and templates are easy to use.

, An article or short story that can fit into a tri-fold brochure or 8.5 by 11 folded booklet with a colorful cover makes a great giveaway that you can leave in the back pockets of airplane seats, in waiting rooms, and pass on during everyday networking opportunities. Carry a giveaway with you at all times. As a writer, it's better than a business card.


Ensure that your contact info and any online links are included.

, Include the title of your book, your name, contact information and links to your FB page, blogs and/or website. The postcard should direct your reader to specifically do something, for example, like your work on Facebook, download the free excerpt, check out your website and sign your guest book.

, You're bound to meet a lot of other aspiring writers this way. Share what you are doing to build your platform and show genuine interest in their story. Building your platform is not only about you but is also about the people who will support your work by reading it, providing feedback and by encouraging other writers, like yourself, to polish their craft and let the world know that another writer has just taken wing!

As an alternative you can obtain blogging software and host the blog on your own domain. This requires more time, money and technical expertise though.;
, i.e dogs, your hobbies, personal philosophy, political view, etc. It can be anything. If you want to attract regular readers, it is best to stick to one subject and become the world's most frequent blogger on it.

Take advantage of social networking sites.,
Try your best to make your blog heading, blog post title and blog post content ‘Keyword rich’.,
Be a celebrity blogger by commenting on various blogs of your taste and interest and leave a backlink to your blog.,
Submit your blog to various search engines, at least to the main search engines like Google ,Yahoo, AOL ,MSN etc is must to get name and fame for your blog .

,
Last but not the least always have the motto of spreading knowledge and enlightenment to the visitors and please don’t do blogging for the sake of any monetary benefit as your motto, take my word you will never be a successful blogger going this road.

",How to Build Your Blog As a Brand," Be true and yourself to your visitors. The big search engines are smart enough of to detect which blogs are providing new, fresh and unique stuff, and reward them with better ranking in search results.;
, SEO technique like link building can help visitors find your blog, but they don't turn visitors into regular readers.

, Except in narrow niches where readers only care about content, a default template is unlikely to be distinctive enough to make you blog a standout brand.

, Blogs are social web elements and require a community or society of their own to sustain and grow, exactly the same way human ,being social animal , is dependent on society .So, do go for social bookmarking like Digg, Stumbleupon, Technorati, Feedburner, etc.

, By ‘keyword rich ‘ I mean to say it should contain some of the phrases which you think are potential searches that people will do and your same post will act as answer to it. For example: I am writing a post on how to open a CD-Rom on others computer from your computer and a potential visitor must be searching for Open CD –Rom trick or prank etc etc …So, what I have to do is to write my post including these “Open CD –Rom trick or prank” strings in my post. This is really useful for coming on top in Search engine rankings hence improving your visitor count.

, This helps a lot in spreading the name .Also blogroll or do link exchange with blog you feel will be helpful for your visitor.

,,"
"
Make your blog topical.,
Inject humor into your copy.,
Have a purpose.,
Be informative.",How to Blog About Your Life Without Being a Bore," Be sure your audience knows what you are blogging about and won’t have to guess. Elude to the topic in your post’s title and the first sentence to reel in your audience.


Select a trending topic. Choose something viral or trending to captivate a larger audience. Also, select a trending topic that interests you--consider writing about something you can’t get enough of and can add a new spin or approach.
Blog about something you know. The best way to express yourself is to talk about something you have experience doing. If you are an exasperated mom, talk about potty training to an audience of other young moms or if you are a trained dog expert, discuss ways to get your puppy to stop chewing on furniture.
Stay on point. Although blogging is conversational, stick to traditional rules and structure in order to remain focused. For example, if your blog is about how to train a puppy, avoid going off on a tangent about what to do when the puppy becomes a dog. Stay in puppy mode, at least for that post.;
, Nothing compels readers to come back for more than humor and laughter. Find ways to poke fun at yourself and the subject matter to make it appear more human and approachable, not to mention more interesting.


Give your posts a human slant. Find ways to add stories or anecdotes that will get everyone nodding their heads in agreement. For instance, if you are writing about ways to organize your family, consider adding the story about the time your husband ripped the house apart looking for his glasses only to find them sitting on his head underneath his baseball cap.
Keep the tone conversational. You want the reader to feel as if you are speaking directly to them and only them. Ask questions that will incite giggles from your reader, such as “When was the last time your husband walked out of the house in black knee socks, dress shoes, basketball shorts and a ripped Dinosaur Jr. t-shirt?” The visual alone may make the reader laugh and give the blog a feeling as if it’s you and the reader swapping stories.

, Many people read blogs for a reason, either how to do something or to gain information about a certain topic. Before you start typing, know what you want to write about and why you are writing the blog.


Include a conversational call to action. One of the most important blog components is to get people talking. You want a compelling statement or question that motivates readers to add comments and respond to what you’ve written and/or discuss the topic further with other readers.

, Although blogs are conversational and relatively casual in nature, back up your findings with actual facts and ideas. Cite any resources and refer to them throughout the blog. This will not only provide the reader with additional resources, but lend credibility to your writing.


Provide educational information. Another purpose of blogging is to educate the reader. Combine your expertise and any other resources to deliver a comprehensive, useful post that provides the reader with value.

, Make the comments non-commercial.

Just ask!",How to Build Your Brand Online," Social media is the new word of mouth advertising. With Facebook recently hitting one billion users, many of whom log in three to fourteen times every day, the ""Like"" and ""Share"" buttons are quickly becoming a brands best friend to reaching a larger audience. Social media provides a more casual forum to share content more often with users who have already indicated interest in your business by joining or following your feed.


Another distinct advantage Facebook has over many other social media platforms is the accessibility and ease of sharing from mobile devices, which continues to drive increasing numbers of users to ""check-in"" at local businesses when finding a minute of boredom, waiting in line, or walking the street. To set up a company page on facebook:








Create a personal profile that will manage your company page
Then go to www.facebook.com/pages/create/
Fill out the information as complete as possible and make sure it matches to other places on the web your business is found
Upload your e-mail address book to connect with people who may already be facebook members
Create a unique facebook url to promote your page with.;
, Savvy consumers are investigating local businesses now more than ever through sites such as Yelp and Google+. These are likely qualified leads about to make a purchasing decision based upon your previous customers experiences, and your last chance to convince them that your company is a reputable, accessible and superior alternative to the competition. Incentives, online surveys and QR codes directing your customers to review sites are great low-cost ways to generate a wealth of positive online brand endorsement before you're scrambling to bury the one bad review that someone (inevitably) posts.


Create a printed brochure that you can hand your client at the end of a successful project directing them to places on the web to review your business.
Generate a QR code on printed materials directing customers to your review page. These are very effective as it is easier/quicker for people to review from their phone than having to log on from a computer.
Set up a free online survey to send your clients, then use these reviews for your website and other marketing materials

, Write a letter to your top ten clients asking for a personal endorsement; ask customers at the end of each appointment or delivery if they would endorse your brand with an online review (having an iPad handy is a smart move in this situation). You can also create a postcard or insert to be mailed out with each invoice or statement, directing customers on where to share their experiences on. You can then feature these testimonials on your website, post to social media, and include on print media to tell everyone how great your company is- without having to say a word."

Find an interesting link on the new site and click on it.,
Repeat as many times as you want.

",How to Blogwalk," Ideally, this should be a site that you've visited before and know you like.


If you have your own website, you might want to use it as your starting site.






If you don't have a good starting site in mind, do a web search on a topic you're interested in and pick a blog from the first page.





;
, There are a couple of places where you can find good links:


The site's links page or blog roll - simply a list of other blogs - will provide you with links that the site's owner thinks are interesting. Many of them will usually focus on a similar topic to the site you're starting with.






The comments section will have links to the blogs and websites of people who read the site. The content of these links may or may not be similar to the content of the site you're looking at. If you're starting with your own blog, checking out your readers' sites is a great way to get to know your readers and to thank them for looking at your blog.







, You can check out the first few posts, search for a topic that you want to read about, or just skim until you find something that suits your fancy.

,


If you have your own blog, this is a great way to create more links to your blog and get new readers. Most blogs allow commenters to list a website in the appropriate space in the comment form. So when you comment, anyone who reads our comment will be able to click on your name and go to your site.






Even if you don't have a blog, leaving comments on articles you enjoyed is a nice thing to do. It lets the author of the post know that you liked what they wrote.







, Use the same methods described in step 2.


If a post you liked on the current site was written by a guest poster with his or her own blog, check that blog out.






If you read a comment that you really liked, see if the person who wrote it has his or her own site.






If you hit a ""dead end"" - a blog with no links, blog roll, or comment links to follow, go back to the previous page you looked at and pick a new link.

, Another alternative is using a free traffic exchange website like http://petlip.com/boosthits. People on Reddit will be interested in your topic and as long as you keep to the rules, you should gain a lot of traffic.]

, Don't mess up coding or make the site look like it was done by an amateur. People will just go on to professional sites if they don't like yours, so make people think that yours is as professional as it can be and people will stay and read the content.

, If you are starting a games website, what will the main age range be? What language will you use? Don't use complicated language for a gaming site, make it more relaxed. A politics site may use more complex language, make it readable for the target audience.

, There are lots of sites that will let you buy advertising with them, you just have to ask them. Make sure you have enough money and then pay them upfront and they will put your advisement on their site for as long as you have asked for.

, Don't give up if you don't get the traffic that you want straight away. It takes a while before you see a good amount of traffic coming onto your site. Google has to index it and you have to get it to a good page rank before the good traffic will come.

, No one wants to read a small site; keep writing more things and there will be more for your readers to read.

, Put a comment box underneath posts and ask questions in your posts, eg, ""We think this is a good idea and we would like to hear from you."" People will then reply to this in the comments section. Keep up the conversation with them and they will keep coming back.

Work on your own website.,
Pay for online advertising.,
Become active in social media and in other online communities.,
Focus on search engine optimization (SEO).",How to Advertise Your Web Design Business1," Websites are important for any business to have as the Internet continues to pull in consumers in nearly every industry, but since websites are your business, your company definitely needs one. How you structure your website is up to you, but you should have a clear focus on what your skill is while providing the information potential customers need. Your website doesn't have to include your rates, but it should include your services, examples of previous work, contact information, and supporting educational information such as if you attended a web design degree program of any kind.;
, You could ad listings on high-traffic websites, or do a pay-per-click campaign with the large search engines. Pay for listings in business directories for web designers.

, These are places you may find your customers. Facebook, Twitter, FourSquare, and other social networking websites give you another avenue to connect to both current and prospective clients while also giving them a way to connect with and learn about you before, during, and after the sale. Become active in places where you know your target market is and in industry-related communities to establish yourself as an expert.

, Let the search engines do some of the work for you naturally at all hours of the day. If you are not familiar with SEO, you can either research and try your hand at it or hire someone to help you. Clients want to know their website is going to be seen, so if you can offer SEO services to your customers, then you have more value.

Make sure your site is complete.,
Submit your site to search engines.,
Submit articles that pertain to your sites content.,
List your site with web directories.,
Join Forum sites and Blogs.,
Last but not least, always adapt to the changes.",How to Attract Visitors to Your Website," If you are building a site you want to have it complete before you start driving traffic to it. Too many times have people published a site that is not done and as a result the visitors turn away due to inadequate content.;
, Once your site is complete you want to have it indexed as fast as possible with the major search engines, so potential visitors will be able to locate it on the web. When doing this, submit your site to only the major search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing. Smaller search engines like Dogpile feed off the larger ones, so if your site is indexed with Google, the smaller ones will automatically find it. For a fast way of getting your site indexed with Google look for the heading ""Submit to Google"" under the Tips section below.

, Article posting is a good way to get your site known to the web community and at the same time allows you and your site to build up respect with your visitors. When submitting articles make sure you always add a link back to your site for the source of the article so interested readers can view your site for more information. Another Article tactic you can use is to submit ""Starter Articles"" to where the reader must visit your site in order to finish the article. This tactic is similar to newspaper columns that have you go to a different page in order to finish the story. Article writing is something you should do on a continued basis well after your site is established. Most Webmasters will write a couple of articles a week in order to have fresh content and to attract new visitors.

, Directories are different than search engines because they list your site by subject or category and not by the keywords of your site. They also allow you to describe your site in more detail so visitors can get a more in-depth feel for your site. Most directories have a screening process so to make sure your site gets accepted always have fresh and unique content. Many people will search directories instead of search engines because they know what category they are looking for.

, Forum sites and Blogs are a great place to post comments and answer questions people may have. Most all Forums will allow you to create a signature to where you can place a link to your site. Each time you post a topic or answer a question your signature gets posted as well. Just as with articles, if you post interesting and unique content people will click on your signature link and go to your site for more information. Posting on Forums is also a great place to meet other webmasters and is something you should do throughout the course of your websites life. Most webmasters will join several Forums that pertain to their sites content in order to maximize their traffic.

, The steps above are great ways to get your site known on the Internet and help attract a large range of visitors. If you want to have a lasting position on the web though you need to be able to adapt to its ever changing ways. With the steps above you eventually will need to branch out and mold them into a way that benefits your website the most and maximizes the niche your site is in.

Build a functioning website.,
Get on business pages.,
Keep your social media updated regularly.,
Have a high-quality online portfolio.,
Gather client testimonials.",How to Advertise Your Photography Business1," The first step in successfully advertising your photography business online involves creating a functioning site. Your website should have samples of your past work, and display your contact information so that new clients can get call or email you. Concentrate on highlighting your talent by putting recent work at the forefront of the page.Photographers must have a good grasp of composition, and a poorly designed website can leave a negative impression.
Keep the site as simple and straightforward as possible. Ensure that the navigation is intuitive and remove unnecessary information or anything can confuse potential clients.;
, Business pages like Google, Yelp, and the Yellow Pages Online will help boost your exposure and help people connect to you. Make sure to tag and keyword entries on your website so that when people search for photography in their area they can find your page. Keep up with customer reviews and make sure to personally and directly respond to any criticism or bad reviews from former clients.


Other websites that would be worth listing your business include the White Pages, Angie's List, Yahoo, and Bing.Remember to provide your contact information and to add a link your website on your business pages.

, Social media allows you to connect to future clients or fans of your work. Keep an active Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and Flickr page. Don't try to balance all the platforms if you don't have the time. Instead, choose a couple of platforms and make sure that you have quality posts.Do this by making your posts interesting and relevant. Post your work on social media to display your skills and talent.


You have to keep Twitter posts under 140 characters.Twitter is more action oriented and should key people into what your company is doing. Adding a photo will typically also get you more re-tweets and likes.
An example of a Twitter message would be, ""We're working on a new project with Gina's Cheesesteaks on Broad Street. Come on over and check out the action.""
Post on Instagram around 5:00 to 6:00 pm since this is when the majority of users are online. Make sure to post a robust photo.A sample of an Instagram post may be something like, ""Check out these amazing photos that Chelsea was able to take during the Philadelphia Pride Parade. If you'd like to pick up a print of one of the photos, click here to go to our website.""
Don't use a personal page for your business. Create one specifically for your photography business.
Each platform has ideal post length and volume of posts throughout the day.
For a platform like Facebook, you should only post once or twice per day.
For more active social media like Twitter, five or more posts per day are usually appropriate.You can also upload photography on your social media platforms to give people a taste of what you're working on, or to build up a following online.
Social media that's used specifically for photography include Pinterest, Instagram, and Flickr.

, Your online portfolio should be a larger catalog of high-quality digital images that you can forward to potential clients. Make sure to use utilize responsive design so that image sizes scale with different resolutions.


Keep your portfolio to 12 photos per page. If you add more photos than 12 photos, your portfolio may look cluttered.
Limit the amount the user has to scroll. Use thumbnails so that the person looking at your portfolio can easily access the photos they enjoy the most.Choose only your highest quality work. If a photograph is questionable because of any reason, it shouldn't be a photo you add to your portfolio.
Popular hosts for photography include Squarespace, Format, Zenfolio, and 500px., Since photography is sometimes subjective, people who hire a photographer will often do so based on things like their personality or the quality of your relationship. Add your client testimonials to your website so that future customers can see what your past clients had to say about you.


For intimate shoots like wedding photography, having a courteous and flexible photographer is a requirement for many couples."

Acknowledge the truth in subscription percentage.,
Offer valuable and informative resources to your subscribers.,
Utilize a tight budget.,
Write articles for submission to various article directories.",How to Build a Responsive Opt in List," A fairly large (95%) percentage of people subscribing to your list will probably never join your primary business or purchase what you have to offer whether it is affiliate programs or your own products. But that should not be a concern, with a positive attitude thank them and say next. Another percentage of subscribers to your list may already have their own primary businesses which they wish to promote. They might just be looking for training and valuable information to assist them with their own marketing efforts.;
, Examples could be e-books, auto-responder services, or training modules which would assist them and enable them to reach their goals and to achieve success in their network marketing businesses. You, in turn, will then earn income from their subscriptions to your affiliate programs which will add value to your subscribers business. From this income, you can then plow back into your business increase your advertising sources to attract more responsive subscribers.

, Offer something of value, for example a free download to an e-book or a report on how to create more web traffic. Build your profile on Facebook, Twitter and Myspace list your website as well as your lead capture page or send people to your blog. A squeeze page is highly recommended.

, Record videos and submit them to you tube and a number of other video directories. If you have some form of budget, submit adverts to various pay per click sites. If you do not have a budget, then there are a number of free options available, but you have to use them correctly.

Shoot photos for charity events.,
Network with everyone.,
Have a physical portfolio.,
Get your business listed in traditional media.",How to Advertise Your Photography Business2," While you shouldn't make a habit out of working for free, sometimes doing a photo shoot for a charity event can help your career. Not only may you get additional networking connections at the event, but you'll also have extra work to add to your portfolio.Contact local charity organizations and see if they need anyone to help take photos for the next event.


Doing free work for a charity event is a good opportunity if you don't have much professional experience.
Doing free shoots for a magazine or newspaper during a charity event should get you a lot of exposure. Make sure they accredit you for the photo.

, Most of the work you'll get as a photography studio will come via personal referrals or word of mouth. For this reason, it's important that you network wherever you are. You may land an unexpected job because you put yourself out there and communicated with the right people. Don't burn bridges and be respectful to new people that you meet.


You can network at social gatherings, gallery openings, or artist meetups.If you do wedding photography, networking at bridal shows may also land you work.

, While most of your work will be viewed online, it's important as a professional photographer to have at least one print portfolio to show to potential clients or agencies that are looking to hire you. Take your high-resolution photos to a printshop and talk to them about options for your portfolio book.


Your portfolio book should be your best photos in the highest possible resolution for the book size.
Talk to the printer about the type of bindings available and how much it would cost for a custom engraving.
Print portfolios can cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 dollars., Look for traditional directories that exist in print. While the vast majority of your work will likely be gained online, print ads will also leave an impression in people's heads and could result in more business. Look for local directories that specialize in photography and get your business listed there.If you shoot wedding photos, getting an ad in a bridal magazine may bring in new customers.
If you're a party photographer, getting your name credited in traditional media like newspapers or magazines can increase your exposure.
Consider placing ads in food magazines if you specialize in food photography.

Offer a referral bonus.,
Hold a promotion for a free photo session.,
Include bonus prints to customers.,
Offer discounts.",How to Advertise Your Photography Business3," You can offer a referral bonus to those that decide to write testimonials for your website, or people who refer other clients to you. If you're memorable and do the job well, they will be likely to refer you to family or friends.Let current customers know about the bonus. You can provide the referring customer with a free print, or a discount on a future photo shoot.


You can say something like, ""Our company is actually looking to take on more projects. If you know of anyone who needs photos taken, we can work out a referral bonus like a couple of free prints in your next order.""
Connect with each client on a personal level and get them to like you.

, Holding a promotion for a free photo session can help build your visibility. In addition to the advertising, holding a promotion allows you to build up your list of contacts which could assist you in securing work in the future. Remember to ask for people's names, phone numbers, and email addresses so you can contact them with future promotions and offers.

, Throwing in a couple of bonus prints can help you retain customers and increase the amount of referrals you get. Make sure to include a small note about how much of a pleasure it was working with them, and let them know that you included the extra prints free of charge.Clients will feel special and taken care of, even if it wasn't a lot of extra work for you.

, Discounts provided to former customers may help you get repeat business from the same clients. Consider the job you are doing for the client or customer and think about the frequency it needs to be done. If it is for a magazine, the agency will likely re-hire you for another shoot. You can further improve your chances by offering a small discount if they decide to utilize your services again.


Consider your standard fee and calculate how much of a discount would still be profitable and worth it.
If someone is buying in bulk, offer them a discount so that they feel persuaded to get more photos.Don't offer discounts for one-off jobs. Reward loyal customers and clients only."

Do the easy do-able steps first and be sure there are no broken links.,
Look at your total number of links.,
Consider whether internal links on a page are duplicates or excessive.,
Focus on external links to your site (that is, back-links).,
Notice the difference between a non-penalized and a penalized website:


This is the sort of traffic graph you want to see for a site back linking to you.,
Be sure to retain diary notes of requests for removal of links.,
Request Google to disavow links.,
Regularly audit links to your site.",How to Audit Links Post Google's Penguin Algorithm Update," Search engines frown on sites or blogs with broken links. There are a number of broken link checkers that are free to use and direct to the specific broken link. Often, affiliate links are terminated if the product is no longer available. Besides the loss of potential revenue, broken links do not add to a good experience for the human visitor. Fix every single one of them.;
, Matt Cutts, Google's Chief Engineer explained in November 2013, that while the 100 links per page limit no longer exists, Google will still monitor the number of links on a site and if there are too many links on a single page, they may consider it spamming and take action.Cutts also shared that a Page Rank is split into the number of links on a page. Cutts has previously shared that more than 100 links per page may be confusing for the human visitor. If you're after the best possible user experience, it will be wise to check the numbers of links per page.

, There may be links to the same page on the navigation bar, on Left or Right hand funnel links, as well as same links through the content or repeated again in ""Related Articles"". Too many links to the same pages can be viewed by search engines as spamming.

, In the days prior to Penguin, the Google Algorithm that penalizes bad or poor link behavior, it was considered good practice to create as many links as possible back linking to a site or blog. Webmasters indulged in directories, thin comments on numbers of blogs and forums, article marketing, and the worst offenders were link farms.


In the post-Penguin update, these practices are certain guarantees for being given penalties. If these sorts of back links still exist on your site, remove them. To find what sort of sites link back to your site, go to your Google Webmaster Tools account; on the left hand nav bar click on ""Search Traffic"", then click on ""Links To Your Site"". Under the five listed links, see ""More"". Click to have all the links listed.
Alternatively find back links using free tools such as Open Site Explorer.
For each one of the links listed, check its current pedigree to determine if it in the sort of neighbourhood you want your site to be associated with. The effect of the Penguin Algorithm is that sites that link to you, and are now badly penalized, can also bring down your own site's reputation.

, Traffic is on the increase and it does not appear to have been affected by Penalty Algorithms. This information was sourced from SEMrush, which provides free site analysis.
See the sharp decline in traffic for this site. This is the sort of site that should be distanced from. Contact the webmaster to request that all links to your site be removed. Contact can either be made using the contact details provided on the website, or if there isn't any, use the information available in Whois.com.

, Check weekly to monitor that the links have been removed and if not, follow up.

, Do this as a last resort. You may have to share with Google the spreadsheet evidencing requests for deletion of unwanted links and the lack of subsequent action from the contentious websites.


While Alexa ranking is often viewed as to a guide for reputation, the ranking is not entirely accurate as Alexa captures only those who have their tool installed. For audit purposes, relying on the Alexa ranking of sites being checked is not appropriate.

, Be sure you know exactly who you're linking to and who is linking to you.

Do it now.",How to Write a Blog with a Creative Thinking Process," In order to keep a successful blog operating you have to have a certain passion for writing and editing. If you're not in this because you love to write and love to read what others have written, then blogging may not be your strength. If, on the other hand, you do love writing and reading the ideas and notions of others, blogging will work well for you.;
, Let your own random scribbling give you the inspiration to be able to stand out. Read anything and everything to get motivated to write and share. Observe objects and subjects from different angles of thought––positive, negative, a mixture of both. What about the topic is interesting? Is it motivating for you as a blogger? Will it motivate a reader? Try to creatively associate the subject matter to your real life in order to find a push to type it out into a fascinating blog piece.


Don’t forget to keep the objective of your blog foremost while writing.

, This understanding is a prerequisite quality that all bloggers need to inculcate. Answering the big WHAT in your head will give you a better understanding of what you can write for the blog.

, Think what the readers are looking for in a blog and what you should do in order to give them what they want.

, This is positive and surprisingly, asking WHY is quite successful in clearing messed up thinking. If you are conscious about finding a reason behind everything, your thought fluidity is broken and the brain starts to reason in a more informed manner.

, Express the thought after you have clearly analyzed the subject. If the reason is logical, then there it is! You get the purpose of your blog.

, After you answer the why question, another one will take you to a better height. When you ask yourself HOW, a slew of probabilities will flash into your mind. HOW gives the answers to what your actions would be while writing the blog. Questions include:



How to go about with the topic

How you and the prospects can benefit; and

How to research, etc.


These are just a few of the many queries that you might face. Answer them meticulously and you can execute the blog better.







, Deep down in your gut, you may be feeling anxiety welling up but this next question is surely going to give you some relief. Answering WHERE can snatch away the anxiety of choosing a platform to blog on. You no longer have to worry about generating popularity for the topic because a number of free online blogging profiles can be used. Make a careful choice of the platform by doing a little research beforehand. However, don't forget that the success and online visibility mostly depends on the blog's great content and the links provided in the post.

, If you are an aspiring blogger, then you have to have the love for writing. Maintain a journal and practice writing at any time during the day. Whatever ideas come out may be brain candies but they'll disappear soon enough unless you remember to pen them down. You never know which weird idea helps you create a logical blog. So keep that notebook going at all times!

, Get your aims clear and sorted. Plan what you need to do for achieving your purpose. List down every step you need to take for creating the best blog and chew over the steps before you actually create the final post.

, Say a big thank you to the wide array of different informative online blogs and articles; you will find they each can help you in paving your way. Relentless reading of different online blogs is a great means for opening up your mind to many different ideas. In doing this, you will gain a greater insight into what others are doing and what readers truly like the most.

, The age old adage that “practice makes a person perfect” makes more sense when you actually start practicing your hobby. Look at things with a creative perspective and form an idea that motivates you to write. While reading a blog, shift perspectives between that of a blogger and a reader so that you get clarity as to how you can write a similar topic in a better way.

, Without doubts, a topic is never clear. Write down each and every question that strikes your mind and find out the ways in which these questions can be answered. After you clear your doubts, you can frame creative ideas and use them to create an attractive blog post.

, By associating an event, object or knowledge to real life experiences, ideas will keep flowing. Look for inspiration in these associations for creating a successful blog post. In short, visualize and feel the topic with all of your five senses.

, There are no limits to thoughts or creativity. By consciously following these steps, you can experience this world in an all new way which will be reflected in your blogs. Plan the process properly and the rest will follow. Good luck!"

Be a good writer.,
Advertise your blog.,
Comment a lot on other people's blogs.,
Join a Pretty Committee.,
Be creative.,
Be kind to others.",How to Make a Clique Roleplaying Blog Popular," No one wants to read short, choppy posts with grammar errors and bad punctuation. If you're on WordPress, they have a button that checks everything for you. Also make your posts long, at least 500 words. Cliffhanger/cutoff posts are good too. They are posts when something dramatic or surprising happens in the end, but then the post is cutoff so you'll be left wanting to read the next one, like books do in a series.;
, In comments, make a little subtle advertisement, like, ""I'm new, maybe you can give me an advertisement?"" or ""New post, check it out?"" The key is to be subtle. You'll look like a desperate loser if you say, ""Please give me an advertisement please I'm new and I have no views and you have so much I just want to be like you please please"" because that is just annoying. Remember: subtle.

, People won't comment on your blog unless you comment on theirs. Make sure your comment is something related to their post, not just like advertising, because as said above, that is annoying.

, It is fine to be a solo blogger, and there is a couple solo Clique blogs out there, but blogs with PCs tend to be more popular. If you have a PC, you can also make many friends.

, Usually the pages people use are ""About Me,"" ""Contact,"" ""CSOTU"" (for Massie's) ""Closet,"" and ""Contact."" Be creative and make up your own pages too. Also make up your own post ideas, like new characters. Never copy from someone else without permission though, because that is rude and shows you have no originality.

, If you're always mean and bossy, no one will ever like you, and they will go against you, ruining your blogging reputation. Always be willing to give advice to other bloggers and they will be kind to you in return.

Switch Blogger back to custom domain.",How to Move a Blog from Blogger to Paid Hosting Using WordPress," Do this on your old site before you even migrate. You can create a blog post to let everyone know that you intend to shift to a new site and of course, provide the link to your new blog. Also let your readers know of the tentative date that you are migrating and do not shut down your old blog at least until a much later time down the road.;
, Look around for the paid hosting site that fulfills your blogging criteria. Paid hosting sites that you might want to keep a look out for are those that offer Fantastico or Simple Scripts installers so that you can easily install most popular applications easily. Also, keep a look out for extra features such as free domain names and free advertising credits. And of course, compare the price and the memory space offered.

, You need to install WordPress on your new server. Make use of installers such as Fantastico or Simple Scripts on your web host's control panel. Click on it and follow the steps to setup WordPress.

, To do this, you first need to login to WordPress admin panel at www.yoursite.com/wp-admin/. Click on ""Posts"" from the left navigation panel. Click on the ""trash"" link immediately below the ""Hello World"" default post.

,


Select Tools from the left navigation panel, click on Import and select Blogger from the list.
Click on ""Install Now"" in the popup window.
Activate the plugin. You will be prompted for access to your Blogger account. Once access is provided, you will be redirected back to WordPress where you will be able to see your blog name or a list of them if you have a few.
Click on the Magic Import Button beside the blog that you want to import to WordPress. Complete the steps as instructed.

, The final but most important step is to do this, which will redirect all traffic from the old blog to the new one. In the admin panel, go to Settings and choose Permalinks. Click on ""Custom Structure"" and paste the following in the text box.


/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%.html

,, At your Blogger blog, set the custom domain by selecting Settings, then Publishing and click ""Custom domain"". Key in your URL and save the settings. Failure to do this step will result in an error message on your Blogger blog if it is accessed; readers will not be directed to your new URL.

Sign into your WordPress account.,
Choose your email settings.,
Go directly to your Dashboard to moderate your comments.,
Download a desktop moderation application, if you use a privately hosted WordPress.org blog.",How to Moderate Comments on a WordPress Blog," Click on the specific blog name that has comments you want to moderate, if you have more than 1 blog. Activate WordPress blog moderation in 1 of the following ways:


If you are activating a privately hosted WordPress.org blog, have an administrator go to ""SiteAdmin."" Then, have them click on ""Options,"" go to ""Blogs,"" and look for the ""Awaiting Moderation"" activation link. Click on the link. When you registered a new blog, your WordPress administrator may have also received an email with this activation link.
If you are starting a hosted WordPress.com blog, go through the new blog registration process, and then go to your Dashboard. Click on the ""Settings"" tab and the ""Discussion"" option. Look at the options for ""Other Comment Settings,"" and choose if the person commenting is required to fill out a name or email, or if they must be a WordPress member. Also, in the ""Before a comment appears"" section, click on ""An administrator must always approve the comment,"" unless you want comments to go up without your approval. You can also decide whether WordPress should try to weed out spam comments.;
, In your Dashboard, under the Settings and Discussion sections, you can choose if you get emails every time someone comments on your blog, or every time a comment appears in the ""Comments"" section of your Dashboard.


This is a good idea if you have infrequent comments, if you travel often, or you have created strict rules on commenting. You can also check a box that says you can reply to this comment via email. If you are moderating a number of blogs, this is not recommended, because it may overload your email inbox.

, Click on the ""Comments"" section in your Dashboard list, and this will take you to the page that holds all your comments awaiting approval. Above the list you can choose to see all comments, pending comments, spam comments or trash.


Click on ""Pending,"" to see all the comments that are awaiting moderation. Hover over the comment with your cursor, and you will see options to approve, disapprove, mark as spam, or throw the comment in the trash. Choose the action that best fits the comment.
You can also choose to take a bulk action to your comments. You can click the box to the left of the comment. Click on the ""Bulk Actions"" drop down menu above and choose to approve, disapprove or delete (trash) all the selected comments. This will save time when dealing with many comments at once, especially to weed out spammers or approve comments from frequent readers.
If you mark something as spam once, all the comments from the same email will be marked as spam.

, If you manage many blogs or 1 popular blog, you may not have the time to log into the WordPress Admin section throughout the day. Choose a plugin to download onto your computer so that you can check on comments without using a web browser.


Go to WordPress.org and click on the ""Plugins"" tab. Search for popular moderation plugins, such as DiscussIt Moderator. If you use Windows Live Writer, you can also choose a Windows Live Writer plugin that will create a page for your blog on your Windows Live Writer.
Check on the right hand side to make sure your WordPress version and other system requirements are up to date, in order to run this plugin. Download the plugin. Open the zip file on your computer. Choose the ""Plugins"" section of your Admin Panel to activate the plugin.

"
"
To start, find a plugin you wish to add to WordPress by visiting http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/;
,
Once you have found the right plugin, make a note of its URL slug (the part of a URL that identifies the page using human-readable keywords.),
Next, you need to locate the plugin’s Subversion repository.,
Now, you need to work out what the latest version of the plugin is.,
At the top of the ‘Read Me’ file, you should see a ‘Stable tags’ line with a version number.,Now you are ready to checkout the plugin using the ‘svn checkout’ command: svn checkout http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/(URL-SLUG)/tags/(version number) (/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name) In this example, the command will look like this:


,
Subversion will now begin to checkout the files into a folder called ‘buddypress.’

,
You can now go to the administration panel in your WordPress account, and activate the plugin!

,
It is also possible to easily upgrade plugins that are installed in this manner.,
Run the ‘svn switch’ command with the new version number to upgrade the plugin: svn switch (plugin URL) For example, if you were upgrading to version 1.6 of Buddypress, the command would be:

,
Subversion will now switch your working copy to the new version of the plugin!

",How to Manage WordPress Plugins With Apache Subversion,", In this example, we will install the ‘Buddypress’ plugin, which has a URL of http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress/ and therefore a URL slug of ‘buddypress.’ (If you wanted to add the ‘WP Super Cache’ plugin, the URL would be http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/ and so the URL slug would be wp-super-cache)

, The standard repository for WordPress plugins, is http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/ Simply add the URL slug to this address, and you have the location of that particular plugin’s repository. In this example, it will be http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/buddypress. Enter this URL and you will be taken to the repository.

, The quickest way to determine this, is to open the ‘Read Me’ file in the ‘trunk’ directory.

, This is the latest stable release, and it is the version of the plugin you should checkout. In this example, the latest release is 1.5.3.1. Tip: if you can’t find the ‘Stable tags’ line, the ‘trunk’ directory should contain the latest stable version.

,,,, Simply find out what the latest version number is (repeat steps 4 and 5, if you do not already know the version number.)

,,"
"
Go to the Plugins section and click 'Install Plugins' in the top right hand of the page.,
Type in 'WP-O-Matic' in the search box, and click Install on the right hand side of the description.,
After the installation you should receive a message stating the installation was successful.,
Now head further down the Settings list on the left hand side of the navigation menu to WP-O-Matic.,
Once you are on the dashboard menu click on 'Add Campaign'.

,
Under the basic tab you are asked to include a title.,
You will be now asked to add a number of Feed URLs.

,
On the Feed URLs page in Wordpress you can also change the Frequency from 1d 5h 0 to 0d 0h 5m and then click Submit.

,
While still on the WP-O-Matic dashboard click the Options link on the left hand side.,
With this address copied you need to go back to your websites control panel.,
Scroll right to the bottom and under the Advanced Box is the Cron jobs option, and click this.

,
You will then be asked your experience level.,
Set the timing of Entry 1 to those that you see above.",How to Make an Autoblog with Wordpress,";
, Click on the red 'Install Now' button on the right hand side.

, Once you see this click 'Activate Plugin'.

, For now just click next for the next four screens without paying attention until you are at the WP-O-Matic dashboard.

,, It doesn’t matter what you choose but something like 'Hypnosis RSS' would be appropriate if you were running a hypnosis site. Once you have done this click on the Feeds tab.

,,, You might see a red warning box but it is nothing to worry about. Copy the web address underneath the WebCron-ready URL.

, This can be found using the following address with your relevant login details. www.YOURWEBSITE.com/cpanel

,, Choose Standard. Once in the Cron Manager you will see a box where you are asked to enter an email address. I would not recommend doing it, as you will receive an email every time a cron job runs.


Underneath is Entry 1. In the box to the right of Command to run is an empty box. Here is the box where you need to paste the Webcron-ready URL you copied earlier. When you have done this, click on the box and type in the word 'curl' and then leave a space between curl and your Webcron-ready URL.







, This means that the cron will check the RSS feeds every five minutes every day for the latest content. Click 'Save Crontab'.

Obtain a domain name and hosting package.,

Skip the unnecessary plugins and widget.,
Do not add an RSS counter.,
Add a video.,
Pay attention to your formatting.",How to Not Seem Like a Newbie Blogger," Get these from a web hosting provider in your area. Look for a site, such as Bluehost, that allows you to easily build your blog with an associated blogging platform without having to take the blogging site's address. By having your own name and domain, coupled with blogging software, you’ll have the benefit of looking professional from the beginning.


So, instead of yoursite.wordpress.com or yoursite.blogspot.com, you’ll simply have: www.yoursite.com. While the free blogs you can setup on wordpress.com, blogspot.com and the like aren’t bad, they're not viewed of as independently professional anymore. If you’re planning to be a successful long-term blogger, then you might as well start on a self-hosted site. This will save you having to migrate to your own domain name later, should you decide to do that.;
, The favicon is the little 16×16 icon that appears next to your web address at the top of most browsers, and it sometimes shows up next to the tabs or in the bookmarks section too. Using the default icon screams “Newbie” to a lot of visitors. Spend five minutes to update your favicon and make it original; it can be a small detail that makes a big impact.


To update your favicon, you’ll need to place a 16×16 pixel icon (named favicon.ico) into your website’s root folder.
For WordPress users, that’s directly into your public_html folder.
You can create a picture file in Photoshop and simply rename it to favicon.ico, or you can create one easily for yourself on a website such as Favicon.cc.

, The permalink is the URL that your blog creates when you publish new blog posts. By default, they usually come out looking ugly, like this: www.smartpassiveincome.com/?p=123 (where p=123 simply means post #123) Not cool, and it definitely doesn’t do any good for search engine optimization.


Before you write your first blog post, change the permalink settings to simply be the name of the post that you create. For WordPress users, it simply means doing exactly what the picture below shows:

, This will resolve the ugly URL rendering, and now you appear to the world to know what you’re doing.

, It's nice that WordPress has tons of plugins and widgets to choose from that can do a wide variety of things for your blog, but a lot of people go overboard and add too many, creating clutter. Not all plugins and widgets are useful. Be conscious about what plugins and widgets you’re placing on your site, and remember that often, less is more. (What good does a calendar on a blog do anyway?)

, New blogs should never include an RSS counter, because a counter with only nine subscribers is a huge flashing sign that says: “Hi! I’m new at this!”. Leave it out until you have over 100 subscribers (at least), and then you can incorporate it into your blog if you really want. In the meantime, work on your content and on making other parts of your blog awesome.

, A quick and easy way to establish yourself as someone who knows what they're doing as a blogger is by adding a video on your blog, preferably somewhere in the sidebar.


A nicely recorded welcome message, or even a quick tip to share with new visitors can definitely make you stand out from even the more experienced blogs in your niche.

, Newbie bloggers almost always write excellent material. However, the format of many newbie posts almost always ends up looking the same: a long, undivided post that resembles an essay. Avoid this by including headings, subheadings, bold keywords, italics, lists, white space, pictures, charts, diagrams, and even links! Make it easy for your readers to get your flow of ideas in small chunks with breather spaces in between.

There are so many blogging platforms out in the market to choose from such as WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr, and Medium, Weebly etc. Try one out; if you are not satisfied with its offered features, then you can move to another, there are countless options some are free and some paid.;
, Even if you don't have a passion, writing about your daily life can make for a good read, depending how you word it. If you are going to blog about what you did today, make it interesting. People are looking for a funny story or your opinion on a debatable subject. They may not be as willing to read how you changed a lightbulb today. Using photos can help enhance the reading experience and engage readers more.

, This simply means you need to go through other bloggers' posts, which helps to improve your writing skills and exposes you to new ways of writing. You must always be a student and ready to learn. You can read about topics of your interest., If you are blogging about fashion, travel or food, then you can choose interesting or attractive themes related to this, which helps to attract readers. Try to make a simple, stylish and professional design.

, The very basics of this is knowing which keywords to focus on. These are what people are searching for in the search engines, and how they might find your blog. Some of these keywords get a lot more searches than others get, so it's in your best interest to eventually choose the ones that do get searched for often. Keep in mind that these are often more competitive than ones that are searched for less -- but you might get lucky.

, Choose a big one that will take longer to reach, as well as three to four additional terms you're going to try to rank for. These should all be similar! Then, you're going to include these keywords in each blog post you make in various combinations. Always focus your posts on one term, and include the others only if they make sense. As you focus on these similar keywords the search engines will start to rank you more highly because your blog is tightly focused and relevant to what you're targeting.

, A lot of ranking decisions are based on how many backlinks you have coming into your website. You can get these links by writing articles to submit to directories, writing guest blog posts on other high traffic blogs, using social networking sites, using social bookmarking sites, and buying links (be very careful with this tactic).

, Google seems to favor domains that have had some time to age and that are going to be a good bet for their visitors. Remember -- Google's (and other engines') goal is to provide the best experience possible for the people who search with them. If your blog is going to be a good match for your search terms it will be easier for you to rank and stay there.

, If you are blogging about music, then don't make a post about twilight or something. If you don't stay on topic it will change what visitors think of your blog.

, Make your posts something you can't get on other blogs. Try to change your format. Also try to organize your post. The better your post is organized the better the post will seem. The better your posts seem the better your blog will seem.


Make sure that you're always posting amazing content. The better your content and the more interesting your blog, the more people will link to it. There is nothing better than getting free links just because people liked what you have to say! Keep your mind on the SEO side of things, but also remember that you are ultimately catering to the needs of the people in your niche. If they like you, the search engines will like you.

, When you start only you will know about the blog. Only start promoting your blog after you get about 15 posts or so. If you promote it before people will think your blog isn't good enough. Don't spam your link. There are plenty of ways to promote your blog.


Use different social media platforms.
Add tags to your post. That will make your posts show up in search engines like google.
Add a link to your site on a forum signature. It will be better if the forum and your blog are the same topic. Make sure you post on the forum though.
Exchange links with others sites. Make a blog roll.

, Don't take a break every other week though.

, When readers leave comments, it means they're interested in interacting with you and getting your feedback. If you ignore them, there is a risk that they'll feel unappreciated and will stop reading your work

, This may show the interest of your reader on your post and also helps in building a healthy relationship with other bloggers. Always give a reply to your reader's comment, so, that they cannot feel ignored from your side..

, There are many ways to do this, such as surveys, polls, quizzes and even competitions.

Get a web host.,

Market your website.",How to Make a Website Using Wordpress," Although you can have a ""free"" website these days, free means many limitations. Free sites will limit your design and function abilities, and there may be ads placed on your website. You will get a sub domain with a free website, instead of a domain. In other words, instead of yourspace.com, you will get yourspace.freesite.com. Why does that make a difference? First of all, everyone has come to recognize these sites as free websites and they will assume that they are inferior. Most importantly, these free websites will not generally get the respect of the search engines. Your free website will not get much traffic from the search engines. So, get yourself a web host.;
, Create the website with Wordpress. Wordpress is a great program to make websites and blogs, and it comes with your web hosting plan. Wordpress is a new breed of website creators known as ""CMS"", or ""Content Management Systems"". These web creators require no HTML or any other programming language. Most of the design elements of the website are controlled by an intuitive menu, or icons.

, Plug in the content. The bottom line here is that you can create a very professional looking website that will generate traffic, without having to learn any programming languages. Instead, you can work on the content of your website. That is the two steps to creating your own website. Instead of needing professional help and paying thousands, you can create your own website in a short time, and pay as little as forty dollars or less. Your website can be as professional looking as any you've seen, and if you wish, this website could very well become a source of income for you.

, Wordpress takes care of some of the SEO work automatically. It broadcasts every addition you make to your website and Google search is known to like WordPress websites.

Text Link Ads or a similar online advertising program may decide to pay you for changing the words ""auto repair"" in your blog into a text link that leads to the website of the auto repair company that is paying for the advertisement. 1 great benefit of text link ads is that they don't use any additional space on your blog design to add ads to your blog, you merely change the text that already exists into a link.

A common issue to crop up during installation is that the configuration.php file is not writable. To resolve this, you can either create a completely empty text file, save it as configuration.php, and save it to your joomla_root/ directory before beginning the installation or, if installation has already begun, continue with the installation, wait for a display of necessary settings to appear at the end, copy and paste them into a new text document, and save it as configuration.php.

, The FTP layer is used to handle file manipulation and enable Joomla! installers on Linux and Unix systems or when there are PHP Safe Mode restrictions. If you have a Windows OS, FTP is not required.

Pay attention to the title of your blog.,
Look at it from the viewpoint of starting with the conclusion.,
Use headings.,
Make lists.,
Rely on good formatting.,
Use links, but don't overwhelm your reader with them.,
Use images.,
Write short paragraphs.,
Keep your word count down low.,
Enjoy the rewards of working on scannable content.",How to Make Your Blog Content Scannable," Don't put lots of thought and effort into your blog and blow off the title. That will leave your great article... unread. First impressions really matter, and titles are the ""hook"" to get your reader interested. Even if you spend a long time getting the title ""just so"", the rewards for your effort will be better.


Think about how the title will look in the RSS feed. What titles make you click on RSS headings? Aim for the curiosity, interest, and even question angles.
Keep the title as simple as possible.
If you use shocking, controversial, or big claim titles, make sure the content meets the promise.
Think about meeting a need.

Titles that express what people often worry or think about are popular. For example, ""Losing weight without trying"" would interest a lot of people!
Indicate the general topic, for those new to the subject or accumulating a broad base of information and reasoning. There will be a lot of these readers, but they'll probably just skim your article. Also indicate the specific topic, for those facing a specific issue. There will be fewer of them, but they'll need to read your special information carefully and may return for more. For instance, ""Losing Weight with the Cabbage Soup Diet"".


Apply these principles to the title of each post, too.;
, The idea of this is to lead with the essential point you're trying make, allowing the remainder of the article to expound upon it. Making the point clear from the outset is better with web writing than leaving the ah-ha! moment until the conclusion. Remember, your reader may never get to the end to discover your pearls of wisdom. Give more up front to avoid your readers dashing off before reaching your brilliant finale.

, The wonderful thing about headings is that they help to guide your writing initially (fill in this bit, then this bit...) and they allow your reader to quickly look through the body of the post to see if the read is something they want to pursue further. Headings draw the eyes downwards,which is just what you want your reader to do when reading on screen.

, Lists break up large blocks of daunting text into manageable bits. Look around the Internet and you'll see that just about everyone uses lists in some type of way to get their message across.


Indeed, although not a blog, wikiHow uses bulleted lists, as you can see from the style used right here. Whether bulleted or numbered, lists allow your eye to quickly run down the list of points.
Lists carve out the text for you, something that makes screen reading a lot more enjoyable – and fast.
Lists get your articles and posts linked to and read more than essay style posts; research done by Darren Rowse and Chris Garrett has proven this., Bold, italicize, and underline your text, without overdoing it. Use these elements of formatting to emphasize points. And changes in the size, style, or color of font can help make content scannable.


Like using highlighter, if you go overboard with it, it no longer serves its purpose.
Underlining should be used with care because it can lead the reader to think they can use it as a link and they'll get frustrated when it doesn't open to a new page.
Some people groan inwardly at bolding or italicizing in places where you wouldn't see it in a book. Getting used to this different style can take a leap of faith but it helps to remember that the Internet is not a book and the rules differ because reading on a screen differs.
Block quotes are neat. Just as they're used in magazine and newspaper articles, block quotes can highlight a particularly juicy, interesting, or profound part of your post, making the reader keen to dig deeper to find out what provoked that quote.

, While a certain amount of links are desirable, you can lose your reader to them too.

, Remember, a picture is worth a thousand words and it certainly helps to make a text 'heavy' blog more interesting.

, Three to five sentences is fine and sometimes, you can even get away with less. Shorter paragraphs also have the benefit of encouraging a reader to keep reading a longer post because each bite sized chunk is easy to digest.


Leaving space is good. Don't seek to cover every part of the post – allow white space to form a regular part of your post's overall appearance.

, Don't let your writing run away from you. Mark Twain once said: ""If you want me to give you a two-hour presentation, I am ready today. If you want only a five-minute speech, it will take me two weeks to prepare."" Finely crafted less words can take a lot longer to produce than a spiel that rolls off your keyboard without nary an editorial input. You'll get better at writing pithier copy without strain as time goes on but for now, put in the effort to learn how to keep the writing shorter and the message punchier.


The key element is to reread it several times and anything, anything at all, that doesn't make sense, sound right, or add to it, comes out.
Read your copy out loud. Nothing substitutes for reading out loud; you'll pick up errors you haven't spotted reading silently and you'll note rambling that isn't so evident from reading.

, The benefit of making a blog post scannable is that your readers are more likely to stick around and even spend time reading your longer posts. It may feel like hard work initially – and it is – but once you're in the habit, you'll wonder how you could ever have done it any other way.

Try Google AdWords.,
Advertise with Bing Ads.",How to Advertise Online1," Google AdWords is one of the leading pay-per-click ad services available on the Internet. You only pay for the ad when people click on it and visit your website, making it a fairly cost effective means of advertisement.


Get started by calling 1-800-919-9922 or by visiting https://www.google.com/adwords/

When you sign up, you'll choose a daily budget you're willing to pay along with the maximum bid you are willing to make for each prospective click. A larger bid will put your ad further up in the search results page. You are not charged for the number of times your ad is displayed, however; you only receive a charge when your ad is clicked.
You'll choose search terms that apply to your ad as you create it. When people search those terms, your ad appears next to or above the search results.;
, While Google is still the most popular search engine, Bing has its own set of followers, and as such, it can be beneficial to purchase space through Bing Ads, as well.


The service provided through Bing is pay-per-click, just like Google AdWords is.
Begin the process by visiting: http://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/

When starting out, you can also sign up for free coaching, which will lead you through the process step-by-step.
On the website, you will get started by creating an advertising campaign. You'll set keywords that match the content of your ad, and whenever a person inputs those keywords into the Bing search engine, your ad will appear somewhere along the top or side of the results.
Ad space is limited, so you will need to place a bid for space. A higher bid will buy you a better slot within the search results.
The bid price you set will be the price you pay each time an ad is clicked. You will only pay when someone clicks on your ad.
You will also be asked to set an overall budget for your advertising campaign. You can set a budget for a daily or monthly basis.

Create as many social media pages as possible.,
Create a Facebook ad.,
Make an ad via Twitter.,
Use ads on LinkedIn.,
Try StumbleUpon.",How to Advertise Online2," Creating a page for your business on each social media site possible will expand your audience while also securing your brand name among competitors. Maintaining an active presence on each website is preferable, but at the very least, you should secure the space as soon as possible.Facebook and Twitter are probably the most obvious social media sites for you to use. In addition to those, however, you should also consider starting a YouTube channel, Pinterest profile, SlideShare profile, Flickr profile, and Instagram profile.
Make your company handle as consistent throughout each channel as possible so that your brand is easier to find from medium to medium.
On a special note, you should definitely create a LinkedIn company page. A company page allows you to grow your company's network and visibility in the professional word. You can set target markets, craft target-specific messages, and add documents, video, and pictures. Like most other social media sites, a LinkedIn company page is free to create and manage.

, If your business does have a Facebook page, you can pay Facebook for ad space on their website.Begin the process by going to your business's Facebook page and clicking the ""Ads Manager"" button on the Admin Panel. You'll immediately be asked to set your budget. From there, you will be lead through to process of setting up a funding source and narrowing the specifications of your ad. You'll be asked to set your audience preferences. You can choose to limit the audience to users living in your town, or you could expand that to state-wide and nation-wide users.
Alternatively, you can go to the ""Build Audience"" link in your Admin Panel and click on ""Create an Ad"" for more advanced options. From there, you can promote your page or even a specific post. You can direct people who click on the ad to your Facebook page or to your website. You can also set more advanced audience options, including an age range, gender options, advanced location options, and interests.
Facebook ads can only have 25 characters in their headline and 90 characters in the body of the ad. You'll also get to add an image.
You will be charged per view, not per click, and you'll pay based on the daily budget you set.

, If your business has a Twitter account, you can pay to have your tweets displayed in front of more people.


Begin by clicking on your settings icon in the top right corner of the page. Select the ""Twitter Ads"" option from the drop-down menu and navigate through the on-screen set-up process.
You'll be asked to set a target audience based on geographic location. Afterward, you should set a budget for your promotional tweets. Twitter recommends a bid of $1.50 per click, but the price you pay can be higher or lower. A higher bid will give your ad more visibility on the site, but you will only be charged per click.
You'll need to manually select the tweets you want to promote. Choose those that link directly to your blog or website.
After you set up your ad, you can also choose to have your Twitter account displayed in the ""Who to Follow"" box on the Twitter home page. You will pay per new follower, and Twitter recommends placing a per-follower bid of $2.50 when you sign up.

, Ads displayed through LinkedIn are similar to ads placed through Facebook. Once you set up your business's LinkedIn page, you can create an ad campaign by clicking the blue ""Edit"" drop-down on your company's page and selecting the ""Promote this Page with LinkedIn Ads"" option.


Most ads link to outside websites, but you can either direct the ads to an outside website or to your LinkedIn page. You can also create multiple options.
Ads have a small thumbnail image. Headings can be 25 characters long, and the body of the ad can only be 75 characters.
After setting up your initial options, you'll be lead through a large number of targeting options. You can narrow down your audience based on geographic location, job title, age, gender, company history, and educational history.
The final step is setting your bid. You can either pay-per-click or pay-per-impression. At minimum, you will need to pay $2 per click or $2 per 1000 impressions, and your minimum daily budget is $10.

, This social media website directs users to other websites throughout the Internet. It has grown in popularity, recently, and is viewed as an entertaining way to share content.


Start the process by visiting this page: https://www.stumbleupon.com/pd

Click on the ""Get Started"" button and create your own campaign account.
You will not provide any ad copy. Instead, you only provide your website's URL, and that URL is inserted into the StumbleUpon flow. Users will then ""stumble upon"" it as they play with the website.
You will set the number of unique visitors you want each day and pay in advance. Each unique visitor will cost you 10 cents by default. You can pay more or less, though. Paying more gets your ad into more active users' feeds, while paying less restricts your ad to less active users.
You can also indicate preferred audience data, including demographics and user interests.

Start a blog or website.,
Harness the power of SEO keywords.,
Cross-blog with other companies.Locate other blogs, companies, and outlets interested in news related to your chosen industry.,
Use reciprocal links and banner ads.,
Submit your website to directories and listings.,
Start an e-mail list.,
Join online communities.",How to Advertise Online3," If you have not done so already, set up your blog or website before you embark on any other step mentioned in this article.


You will need some sort of URL for your ads to link to. Moreover, setting up a blog allows you to interact with potential customers and others in the industry more efficiently.
If you are actively selling a product or service, you should consider having both a website and a blog. Websites are fairly stationary existences, only receiving updates when new stock arrives and similar events happen. This stability makes it easier for customers to make purchases. On the other hand, a blog is most effective when updated regularly and may contain content that relates to your company both directly and indirectly.

, SEO stands for ""Search Engine Optimization."" Essentially, SEO keywords allow your website or blog to appear higher within search engine results, which increases its exposure to potential customers.


Pick out keywords that accurately relate to your company and include these keywords in the HTML ""META"" tags on each of your website's pages. You should also repeat these keywords throughout blog posts and the text of your website's homepage.Keywords should describe the content of your website and the content of any post or page you apply them to, but in order to get the most out of the keywords you use, you should also choose terms and phrases that people are likely to search for. Something too generic will cause your page to get lost among search engine results, but something too specific will limit the number of people who stumble across it.

, On occasion, you should forward a few of your own blog articles to these outlets and ask if they might be willing to consider posting that content on their website. In exchange, offer to post some of their content on your blog, as well.


In this manner, you benefit from their customer base and they can benefit from yours.
The more your business's name appears throughout the Internet, the more familiar people will become with it, and the wider your customer base will spread.
The posts you exchange should not be blatant advertisements for your business. Instead, opt for posts on how-to topics related to the company, stories about your business successes and failures, and lessons you learned while building and running your business.

, Reciprocal links and banner ads harness the same principles as cross-blogging. By exchanging links or banner ads with company websites that share a similar target audience, you benefit from the other company's customer base while it benefits from yours.


In exchange for inserting links to your products on their website, you will need to find space on your website to insert links for products sold by that same partner company.
Similarly, you can directly ask another company or blog to do a banner ad exchange. Offer to place a banner ad on your website for the other company as long as that other company places a banner ad for your website on theirs.

, While directory listings tend to be fairly plain and simple, they are still an important means of advertisement. People search directories with a specific concept or desire in mind, so there's no need to ""pitch"" your product or service here. You only need to let others know that your company exists.

Search out all online yellow pages and similar online directories and submit your business's contact information directly to them. If your company has a physical location, make sure that you list it under online travel directories, as well.
You can also do an Internet search for individuals, business associations, and industry associations that maintain popular lists of resources applicable to your business. You should also create an entry for your business on those specialty listings.

, Do not neglect your old customers in your ongoing search for new ones. E-mail lists are a good way to advertise to repeat customers or potential customers who have demonstrated an interest in your business. Place a link on your website that allows interested parties to sign up for updates on your business's news and promotions.


Periodically send new product announcements, information on special offers, and coupons. You should also include any useful information directly related to your business.
You could also allow customers to sign up for a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly e-zine in which you write about your company, your products and services, and your overall industry (even when it does not connect directly to your company). E-zines tend to be a little more in-depth than standard promotional mailings.

, Online message boards and similar communities allow you to interact with other people who share your interests. Choose an interest or topic that directly relates to your business and join online communities that address it.


You can advertise your business through these communities as long as the community rules do not forbid it.
Make sure that most of your interactions within these communities are personal rather than business oriented. If you are permitted a personal page or tagline, include all of your business information there. Most of the actual discussions you have with people through these communities should not directly refer to your business, however. If you push your business too much, you might lose community members' trust.

, Let the owner know you are interested in advertising and ask how to advertise on your favorite websites. Give information about your products and what you'll be advertising, and ask about rates and ad placement.

, If the site is a blog, see about adding your blog to its blog roll; you should add a link to the site on your blog roll to reciprocate.

Can they? Double-check the page appearance in different browsers, paying special attention to video and flash, as they not only create distraction, but also build additional barriers for the user to overcome. Social media sharing buttons on a landing page are distractions too, try to eliminate them or keep those in the footer.

.
, Check your headline. There’s not always a perfect headline, but there are a lot of bad ones. Most users will make the decision to stay or go within seconds of visiting your landing page. Your headline must catch the user’s attention immediately and compel them to keep reading. Unlike traditional website navigation, landing page navigation should make it difficult for a user to easily leave the page. Allowing website navigation on the landing page offers more exit options and may hurt the conversion rate. Another reason to remove the standard website navigation is to gain better control over what the visitor sees and interacts with on the page.

, It’s recommended that any folds on your landing page be eliminated. However, if a fold is unavoidable, make sure it does not take away from the call to action – keep all important components above the fold. In addition, it’s okay to have multiple CTAs (calls-to-action) on one page, as long as the primary CTA is in the top position above the fold.

, Poorly constructed and unreasonably lengthy forms are still surprisingly common in today’s landing pages. Remember to keep the user in mind and optimize your forms to provide the best experience. Evaluate each form field to determine if the information requested is really necessary. To make the form better, allow:


The input cursor to hop to the next field after the current field is completed;
the user to tab around fields,
fields to be auto-populated where possible.

, Studies show that white space improves the user experience and allows key messages to stand out. Your landing page should do the same. Evaluate every element on the page for its contribution to user conversion rate. If you don’t need it to get your message across, remove it. It may seem like more is always better. But if you take a step back and really give it some thought, is more really better? Don’t overload your users.

, Testimonials and privacy policies help create the necessary levels of trust required for today’s online businesses. Would you purchase an item from a site that did not have this information? In addition, if you have any awards or other forms of recognition, a landing page is a great place to highlight them and boost your corporate validation.

, All buttons on the page need to be big, use full color, and be located above the page fold. Test to learn what colors and sizes work best but take baby steps and test one thing at a time, or you risk not understanding what exactly worked the magic.

, Pages that take too long to load produce “barely there” conversion rates, a poor user experience, and Google quality score issues. Use tools to check your page load times and make sure it takes less than 7.5 seconds to load. For a start, you can use Google Page speed insights and Pingdom website speed test tool and analyze bottlenecks and fixing them for reducing load time.

, Images are probably the most controversial element of any page, but even more so for landing pages. Try testing stock imagery versus amateur photography. An image should compliment your messages, making the entire page look more professional.

, If you are creating multiple landing pages with only slight variations in text, it’s wise to ensure that these pages are kept away from search engine spiders. To prevent duplicate content penalties from search engines, make your general purpose landing page available for indexing, but use robots.txt or a robots meta tag to exclude other pages.
