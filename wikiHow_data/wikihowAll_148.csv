Its learning site, http://learn.wordpress.com/, includes a number of features, including the following:


Get Going Fast: A quick-start guide/checklist to refer to when creating a website or blog to make sure you’ve covered all your bases.
Get a Home Page: Explains how to use WordPress to create a home page and customize navigation, among other features, in more detail than Get Going Fast.
Get Lingo: A glossary of WordPress-related terminology.
Menus at the top of each page with links to each section so you can link directly to the information you need.
Generous use of screenshots to illustrate how Word Press’ features work.
Links to WordPress.com Support, a knowledge database.;
, WordPress actually has two websites, wordpress.com and wordpress.org; the WordPress Codex is part of the latter site. The Codex is the online manual for WordPress, with links to instruction in downloading WordPress, designing blogs, using themes, and creating and using plug-ins., WordPress offers several support forums, accessible by hyperlink from the WordPress Codex. In these forums, you can post questions about a particular WordPress feature and receive answers from any of a number of volunteers.


You may find the forums more useful as you get more familiar with WordPress, while initially you may find the answers as complicated to understand as the questions., In addition to the written resources on the WordPress websites, there are also a number of third-party blogs by WordPress users, as well as by webhosting companies.There are also online magazines with articles about or devoted solely to WordPress.Good places to learn WordPress include the SpoonGraphics website and WPTuts+., Although thought of chiefly as an entertainment venue, YouTube also has thousands of instructional videos on many different topics, including WordPress.You can type the specific aspect of WordPress you want to learn more about into the YouTube search engine, or type the general term “WordPress” and select from one of the suggested search terms., Online courses offer the convenience of Internet classroom access with the structured approach of a physical classroom. Most classes take you through the process of building a website in WordPress from start to finish; some, such as Lynda.com, cover some of the skills outside of WordPress itself that can enhance your experience. .Some online classes are offered only live at certain times, while others offer recorded modules you can review if you can’t tune in at the scheduled class time.

, Some of these are offered in conjunction with online classes, while others are independent of classes. Some support groups offer face-to-face meetings, while others meet through social media sites such as Facebook or LinkedIn., Although WordPress automates a lot of the creation process, knowing a markup language such as HTML (HyperText Markup Language), XML (Extensible Markup Language), or XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) lets you create your own themes and modify existing ones to better suit your needs.

, A cascading style sheet (CSS) is a way to specify how a document written in a markup language appears. It allows the markup language to address the document’s content, while it governs the document’s appearance.WordPress uses it in conjunction with HTML and XHTML to create themes., WordPress uses the scripting language PHP (standing for “Personal Home Page”). Scripts are used in creating WordPress plugins, which add functionality ranging from displaying weather reports to spellcheck., Most websites use images to one degree or another to illustrate the message contained in the website’s text or to carry the message itself. You should be comfortable using an image editor program to resize, crop, and adjust the pixel density of images you plan to use on your website or blog.

, Each person has his or her own best way of learning something. Knowing how you learn best and choosing a method for learning WordPress that fits your learning style can help you master it more easily. A list of learning styles is given below, along with available methods for learning WordPress for you to consider:Aural: You enjoy learning through sound and music. You might like to learn WordPress through classroom lectures or podcasts.
Logical: You enjoy learning opportunities that require you to think things through. You might want to attend WordPress classes that focus on figuring out how to do things in WordPress.
Physical: You enjoy “hands-on” learning. You’ll want a class with ample time to practice what you’ve just learned or else pause the video frequently to try out the concept you see displayed.
Social: You enjoy learning with other people, working in groups when possible. You’ll want to be part of a WordPress group that meets in person.
Solitary: You enjoy learning things on your own. You may learn best from the WordPress sites, a third-party blog, a YouTube video, or some combination of these.
Visual/spatial: You like to learn from pictures. You’ll want to refer to the screenshots in the WordPress pages and in YouTube videos frequently to help you learn.

Create your first post.,
Give your post a title.,
Start writing.,
Customize your text.,
Add an image to your post.,
Adjust the post settings before publishing.,
Preview your post.,
Save the post for later.,
Publish the post.",How to Create a Blogger Blog2," Your blog won't be a blog until you start writing, so you may as well get your introductory post up right away! You can worry about more detailed customization. To start writing, click the ""Start blogging!"" link underneath your blog's title, or click the orange Pencil button. This will take you to the post editor., At the top of the editor, you will see a ""Post title"" filed. This title will appear at the top of the post on your blog, and will show up at the top of the window when the post is selected. Make your title catchy, because it needs to draw the reader in.


Generally, your first post should be introductory in nature. Talk about yourself and your goals for the blog, or dive right in to the content you want to create.

, There are two main ways that you can create your blog post: composing the post using the built-in word processor, or writing the post in HTML. Use the buttons at the top-left corner of the editor to switch between the two modes.


If you are unfamiliar with HTML, the word processor will give you plenty of options for customizing the text of the post, and easily allows inserting links, images, videos, and more.
For more instructions on using HTML to create custom blog posts, see this guide.

, Use the toolbar at the top of the editor to adjust properties of the text. You can change the size, color, alignment, and more, much like a standard word processor.


The ""Normal"" drop-down menu allows you to change the formatting based on the type of content. You can choose between ""Normal"", ""Heading"", ""Subheading"", and ""Minor heading"". Not only will these affect the size of the text, but they will also factor into the way search engines process your page.
You should generally try to ensure that your heading formatting is correct and easy-to-read. Section titles or chapter breaks should get the ""Heading"" format, with smaller sections using the other two heading format styles. The content of your article should have the ""Normal"" format.

, Images help grab the reader's attention, and generally make posts more interesting to look at. You can quickly add images to your Blogger post by clicking the ""Insert Image"" button in the toolbar.


You will be given several options for adding pictures. You can upload them from the computer you are working on, link to other pictures already on your blog, link to pictures in any of your Picasa web albums, take a picture with your webcam, or link to the URL of a picture elsewhere on the internet.
If linking to an image from another site, be aware that if the picture is removed from that site it will not display on yours either. Some sites do not take kindly to links to their pictures either, as it costs them bandwidth every time it is loaded on your site.

, You will see a list of options in the menu on the right side of the post editor. These allow you to change the settings of the post before it is made public.


Labels - These are tags that are added to your posts, which allow posts of similar content to be grouped together. These are useful when you have a lot of posts, because it helps readers find similar posts on your blog. Tags also help search engines find content that matches a user's search. Make sure that your tags are accurate, short, and helpful.
Schedule - You can either have your post published immediately, or you can schedule it to be posted at a future time and date. This can be really useful if you are on a roll and are creating lots of content at once, but want to ensure that it is drip-fed to your audience.
Permalink - This allows you to set the address that links directly to your post. By default it will be based on the post title, but you can change it to whatever you'd like.
Location - This allows to to tag your post with a location. This is especially useful for travel blogs.
Options - You can adjust various other options for the post here, including whether or not readers can comment on the post and how the HTML code is interpreted.

, You should preview every post you make to ensure that the formatting looks correct and that all your content is displayed how you want. Click the ""Preview"" in the upper-right corner to get a sneak-peek.


Proofread your blog post and then proofread it again. Grammatical errors will quickly turn away readers, so male sure that the post is error-free.

, If you need to leave before you finish writing your post, click the Save button to save a draft that you can easily return to later. it is always wise to save your work often in case something unforeseen happens.

, You've written the post, perfected the formatting, proofread for errors (twice!), and added the labels. Now it's time to send it out into the wild. Click the ""Publish"" button at the top of the editor. You will be taken to your Posts page, and the post will appear at the top of the list. Congratulations! Now it's really time to get to work.

Update regularly.,
Find a niche.,
Interact with your readers.,
Advertise your blog.,
Enable ads on your blog.,
Customize your blog.,
Track your stats.",How to Create a Blogger Blog3," The number one key to a successful blog is regular, quality content. If you want to retain readers, your blog needs to be updated on a consistent basis. You should strive to post at least once a week, more if your content allows it. While you don't want to deluge your readers with content that they'll never get around to reading, you'll want to ensure that they have a steady stream that will keep bringing them back.Try to set a schedule that you can stick to, and mark it in your calendar. Tell yourself that you need to have your blog updated by a certain time on a certain day of the week, and try to keep from procrastinating on content.
You can always write multiple posts at once and schedule them for later dates if you're really feeling on a roll.

, Successful blogs find a niche, or interest, that they can become an authority on. This helps you build a cohesive audience and if you update regularly and with good content, you can quickly become a top source on major search engines. Take stock of your interests and see how you can leverage any of them into a successful blog., As you start to gain an audience, you will most certainly begin to receive comments on your articles. If you take some time to respond and interact, you'll build a community around your blog. As the community grows, so will the loyalty of your readers, leading to more and more guaranteed views.


Make sure that you spend some time moderating your comments, as the internet has a tendency to get nasty at times. Keep your comments civil and your community will grow quickly.
You can review and respond to all of your comments by clicking on the ""Comments"" option in your Blogger menu.
Blogger will attempt to identify and remove spam comments, so make sure to check the ""Spam"" section of the Comments page to ensure that legitimate comments aren't being removed.

, While good content is essential for bringing readers, so is a little promotion. Letting people know that your blog exists can help your blog stand out amongst the incredibly large crowd. Use social networking to your advantage to create a presence that can't be ignored.


Create a Twitter account and use it to post a headline and link to each new blog post you create.
Blogger allows you to quickly integrate with Google+, which can bring in lots of new readers. You can enable Google+ integration by clicking the Google+ menu option in the Blogger menu. Integrating with Google+ means that your Google+ profile will become your Blogger profile.
Make sure to let friends and family know about the blog through Facebook, but don't fill their inboxes! No one responds well to having blog advertisements shoved down their throats.
Comment on other relevant blog and forum posts with links back to your article. This is one of the basics of back-linking, an essential search engine optimization practice.

, Once you meet a few criteria, your blog will be eligible for AdSense ads. You will receive payments based on clicks and impressions made by these ads.


To qualify for AdSense, you must have an active blog for at least six months, be at least 18 years old, and ensure that the content of your blog doesn't violate AdSense policies.
You will need to create an AdSense account and then decide how you want the ads displayed on your blog. See this guide for more detailed instructions on enabling ads and placing them in your blog.

, Blogger has a lot of templates to choose from, but you can go a lot deeper and truly make your blog your own. From changing the blog's icon to completely rearranging the site, customizing your blog will help you create a unique brand for your blog.


Click the Layout option in your Blogger menu to adjust the content block son your blog. You can move them around to suit your style.
Click the Edit links in the content blocks to change their titles and other options.
Add more interactivity to your blog by clicking the ""Add a gadget"" link in the Layout section. You can choose from a variety of add-ons, from basic Blogger-created extensions to hundreds of user-created add-ons.
Customize your template by clicking the Template option in the Blogger menu. You can choose from a variety of preset templates, each of which can be further customized by clicking the orange ""Customize"" button after selecting them. This will allow you to change backgrounds, content widths, and text options.
If you're comfortable with HTML and CSS, you can dive into the code and create whatever you'd like by clicking the ""Edit HTML"" option. This will give you full control over the look and feel of your Blogger site, but is likely to be more than most bloggers need.

, The Stats option in the Blogger menu will allow you to monitor the traffic on your blog. You can see which articles are getting read, see where readers are visiting from around the world, track page views over time, and more.


Use your page views to help determine why certain articles are getting read more than others.
Your global audience will help you tailor content to match your audience's specific needs. You can also time your blog post publishing to correspond with the prime reading times for that particular audience.

, Before starting the upload, you need to know that the standard FTP software takes more time than the PC file manager, so, be patient and prepare yourself for some time that can be 30 minutes or a few hours depending on your plugins file size and your internet connection speed.
When you launch Filezilla, you will get 4 boxes at the top of the screen where you need to add your ftp login details there, forget the last box that says ""Port"" simply because it's always 21 in the majority of servers and you can leave it blank.

Now, you have your ""plugins"" directory and you can start moving your files.The upload is simple, just move the files from the left section that's your local machine and place them to the right section that is the hosting server. You can also copy and past your ""plugins"" files as usual. You can upload your plugins one by one or simply delete your blog folder called ""plugins"" and put all your local plugins in a folder called also ""plugins"", so WordPress will recognize your plugins later.

, When the upload complete (that will takes some time) you will have the plugins installed and not active, so you need to login to your WordPress dashboard and click on ""Plugins"" then, activate theme one by one or all at once. Now, you should have plugins that works normally after the upload process using Filezilla.

Try some of these ideas to get your creative juices flowing:



Gaming. Nowadays, many people play games. You can write about games you play and post updates and/or cheats/hints.

Politics. Sure, everyone has an opinion about politics, but you may have a unique point of view that needs to be heard.
'""Fashion/Style/Beauty.""' Blog about fashion and what new trends are in for fashion. For style, blog about different ways you can wear that new scarf you just bought. For the topic on makeup, talk about what new trends are in, and/or different ways to style your eyeliner.

Food. Who doesn't love good food? Share your recipes, start writing reviews of the local cuisine scene or write about how the food that you ate in China was nothing like the food that Chinese restaurants serve in the United States of America.

Reviews. Reviews of movies, games, products, and anything! It doesn't matter how old it is or what it is, just give your general opinion on whatever your reviewing, and at the end, give it a rating. If you keep it fresh by adding clips or photos and pulling from sources that nobody else is using, you could have a hit blog on your hands.

Cars. Are you a car enthusiast? Post pictures of your favorite new models or reports from car shows.

Love. Everybody needs some love! Maybe you can give advice about how to get a date! If you're a little more inappropriate maybe be a little sexual to get more men or women followers.

Your business. Your blog doesn't have to be a hobby. A blog can be a fantastic tool for connecting with your customers and for providing them with helpful information.;
, While you want to know your broad subject area, you need to focus your blog topics more narrowly, so that it has a clear purpose. Here are some ideas for ways that your blog can connect with your intended audience:



Teach something. If you're passionate about a particular subject, and you have a lot of experience in that area, then you can offer your knowledge to both people who are new to the subject and others who are as experienced as you are.

Provide the latest news and trends. Write about the latest developments related to your topic. You want to be someone who's viewed as the ultimate insider so that you can continue to increase your blog's readership.

Make people laugh. Are you the funniest person you know? No matter what your subject area, you can present your experiences and thoughts in a humorous way that will really resonate with people.

Inspire others. Have you overcome an obstacle, such as a serious illness or a difficult life experience? Do you want to turn your challenges into something that will inspire others to overcome their problems? If that's the case, then make your blog inspirational.

Know what not to blog about too. Your workplace, your coworkers, your family members, etc. may take a dim view of anything on your blog if it blows open secrets, shares confidential information, makes fun of people you work or live with, or causes other people trouble. Know the limits––check with your workplace what is and is not permissible by way of personal blogging and ask your friends and family before including them in your posts.

, Take a look at other blogs on your topic to see what other people are already doing. Ask yourself what you have to offer that is different from what other people are already doing. Identifying your niche will give your blog an angle that distinguishes it from your competitors.

, Try brainstorming a list of names and writing them on a piece of paper, or talk to friends and family to get ideas. You can also try freewriting to see what comes out of your mind as you free associate about your topic.

, Go to a keyword suggestion scraper site like http://ubersuggest.io/


Enter items that are relevant to your topic into the appropriate search field. You can search by word or phrase, by website or by subject.
The tool will generate words or phrases associated with your topic. Pick the words that have a high number of monthly searches but have low to medium levels of competition. Try to include them in your blog name.
Check these keywords from time to time when you're writing a blog post. If you fit the keywords into your posts in a natural way, then search engines may be more likely to pick up on your blog and show it to people who are conducting searches about your subject.

, Blogger and WordPress are 2 of the most popular blog creation sites on the Web.



Blogger: Google owns Blogger and has set it up for ease of use. Your blog will be extremely easy to set up and maintain, and you'll have Google's traffic management tools at your disposal. You can purchase a custom domain name for US$10 per year or you can get a free BlogSpot domain name such as yourblog.blogspot.com. If you already own another domain name, you can use it for no cost.

Tumblr.com. This is a very handy, world-wide micro-blogging site. It provides a very friendly user interface and even helps place ads on your blog page to get you money. For more information read this article on how to create a Tumblr account.

WordPress: With WordPress, getting started will take more time. However, you'll find that WordPress has a wide variety of more sophisticated tools for enhancing and promoting your blog. You can purchase a custom domain name on WordPress for $18 per year or map an existing domain name to WordPress for $13 per year. If you want a free domain, you can use something like yourblog.wordpress.com.It is also important to note that there is a difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. Using Makeblog.org is a great way to start your blog. They are both free to use. Meanwhile, with Wordpress.com, it is hosted by the Wordpress organization, so your domain will be on a subdomain of Wordpress.com. Meanwhile with Wordpress.org, you are self hosting it, so your domain will be on your selected name. The former restricts bloggers from making an income and while the latter does require set up on your own host, it then allows full access to your blog's backend, full suite of features and improved SEO performance. Webs.com: Webs is a website builder that has been around since 2001. Everything about this website builder is customizable with their drop-n-drag feature. What's even better about this builder, is that you do not need any technical skills. Everything you need to know about what you want included in your blog is in front of you with easy to see/read options. Personal sites start free with no trial period. Of course, if you want some enhanced features, you will need to upgrade for an affordable fee.

You can choose a template from the options on the screen, or you can choose a template later if you want to see more options.
Click the orange ""Create Blog!"" button.

,, When you're done, click ""Publish.""

, Click on the ""Get Started"" link.

, In the last field, type the proposed web address for your blog.


The web hosting will do a quick lookup to see if the name appears on their system already. If your desired name is taken, WordPress.org will display a series of available alternatives. You can choose 1 of those options or try a different domain name until you find something that works.
Scroll to the bottom of the page and click ""Create Blog.""

, When it arrives, click the link and then sign into WordPress with your username and password.

, Your Theme determines the layout and appearance of your blog. You can either search for themes after clicking on the ""Find a Theme"" button or you can browse Themes based on criteria like what's trending or what's most popular.

, If you want to, you can upload a photo of yourself by clicking the ""Choose File"" button in the gray ""Blog Picture/Icon"" box.

, Do you want any Internet visitor to be able to read your blog, or do you just want your friends and family to be able to read it? Pick the appropriate setting by clicking on the ""Reading"" link beneath the ""Settings"" tab.

, Click the ""New Post"" tab and enter your title and the body of your blog. You can also add photos, videos or links by using the appropriate buttons. When you're done, click ""Publish Post.""

, You can promote your blog on your personal social media accounts or on your business accounts.


Most blog hosting sites will automatically publish a link to your newest blog post on Facebook or Twitter. Look for sharing settings or buttons when you publish your post. For instance, WordPress lets you control sharing by going to your Dashboard and clicking ""Sharing"" under the ""Settings"" tab. Blogger has social media buttons on the bottom of your post for sharing.
Add buttons to your posts. Your readers can click these ready-made buttons to share your blog on their Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or other accounts.

, Add an ""About Me"" page on WordPress or click ""Layout"" and then ""Edit"" under ""About Me"" on Blogger. Promote your expertise related to your topic as well as including any personal information or background information that you want to share.

, You can add a Blogger site to Blogger's listings. You can also list your blog with directories like Technorati or Blogdex.

, If another blogger ""Likes"" your site, then go to his or her site and either ""Like"" a post or follow the blog. Also, comment regularly on other people's blogs. People will get to know you from your comments and will come to appreciate your expertise.

, You can also add the address to your business cards.

, If your blog is full of grammatical errors or looks unattractive, you aren't going to draw regular visitors. You also need to make sure that you publish regularly so that your content is up-to-date and fresh for your readers.

Love your readers and give back to them.",How to Avoid Common Beginner Blogger Mistakes," More than anything else, what really matters about your blog is that it represents you and is genuinely unique. While you still need to attune your messaging to what people want to read, whatever you write must be infused with your unique take and style. Discard any notions that it's alright to harvest a bunch of news stories and drop them straight into your blog; nobody will want to read that when they've probably already read them somewhere else. Instead, take those news stories and add your angle to them – give people your opinion on the news story, providing your conclusions about the consequences or moral involved.;
, Directly related to being original is the issue of not copying. Don't assume that no-one will recognize ""borrowed"" material; they will without doubt. And think of it the other way around – would you want someone ""borrowing"" your hard efforts? It's common courtesy (and the law), to tell your readers where you got your information from. Blog readers are both discerning and widely read; they'll spot a copied story a mile off and won't appreciate it. Although it can seem very tempting when you're starting out to use the words of others, resist doing so and persist with writing original content. Start small and get into a rhythm; over time, it'll get easier.


Being original with your content increases your reader's trust in you. Your readers will soon grow to know, appreciate, and expect your writing style.

Cite your material. Not only is this decent morally but it also takes care of potential copyright problems - if you want to copy, do so by using quotes or paraphrasing with the referencing made very clear. Another benefit of referencing is that it enables readers to visit your sources and learn more for themselves, something that many blog readers appreciate and expect.







, Even if you're not a lawyer or a journalist, it's vital to understand how you might accidentally walk into a legal minefield if you make certain errors. The basics of main importance to grasp include copyright, trademarks, defamation, and illegality.


Another potential minefield is trusting one research source without backing it up with another one - basically, adding hearsay upon hearsay. If you're not sure, keep researching to have several sources boosting your assertions.
Check out the Electronic Foundation Frontier for good layperson's legal information on blogging., If you're absolutely serious about becoming a good blogger, it's important to learn from bloggers who have already trodden this turf well and worked out what does, and does not work. If you're targeting people other than your very forgiving family and friends, knowing what other bloggers have done is vital. Read what the best bloggers have to say about their experiences of blogging and their advice to new bloggers. Some good bloggers to check out include:


Heather Allard, Darren Rowse, Chris Garrett, Corvida Raven, Tim Ferriss, Leo Babauta, Jessica Faye Carter, Dan Zarella, Seth Godin, Chris Brogan, Meryl K. Evans, Men With Pens, etc. There are plenty more great bloggers out there but this should be a good start for you!News blogs are also good to learn from. News blogs such as The Huffington Post, etc., take news stories and provide their opinions on the story. You'll need to discern for yourself the political and other agendas behind each blog. Sometimes the best blog is one that aims to be neutral or seeks to reflect both sides of the spectrum - look around before deciding how you'll approach your own blogging.






Do a search for ""Top Blog Posts"", or ""Top Blogs on Cars/Dogs/Babies/Skiing"", ""Top women/men bloggers"", etc. Whatever your interest, there will be someone blogging on it already. You can also search for fields such as ""Top mommy bloggers"", ""Top daddy bloggers"", ""Top celebrity bloggers"", ""Top farming bloggers"", etc., to see who readers are voting as the best in their genre.






Note that some bloggers are more willing to discuss their craft than others; keep an eye out for the bloggers who take the time to share blogging advice. Where possible, look for blogs that give advice without trying to sell you all the answers (it happens even with the best, so be prepared to cherry-pick and cobble together your advice tidbits!). Whether or not advice is offered, at least learn from reading the popular blogger's writing styles to work out what keeps them connecting with readers.

, If you're used to writing in a technical, academic, or formal way, blog writing might come as a bit of a shock. Blog writing style tends to be more conversational, peppered with a lot of your own opinion (however outrageous!), and above all, it needs to be interesting. The writing style best suited for you will come down to the content of your blog and its likely readership. Clearly, a blog that is more technical in nature can carry more technical writing but even then, your readers will want you to break down the latest techno-whizz gadget to terms that they can understand and digest quickly.

Be careful to avoid preaching at your readers. For many blogs, readers are looking for you to meet with them eye-to-eye, not to sermonize, scold, or seem superior to them. Treat them as equals. Expect to be humble, and to share foibles that each of us experiences in daily life. A sense of humor and humility are always important for a good blogger.






Political blogs can easily become bogged down in angry rants or intolerant tirades if you wear your heart on sleeve without involving your head. Seek to maintain a serious tone in such blogs without resorting to name-calling and deprecating comments.
Be very careful when cursing. If your blog fits cursing and the occasional ""eff"" word makes great sense in the context, then fine, go ahead and use it. But a blog peppered with abusive commentary and little else than cursing will put readers off. Letting off steam is one thing, being a swear-o-holic is quite another. And cursing all of a sudden when you've never done so before will lose some of your readership.







, Do a lot of research on this to find what works best. Use the lessons others have already learned; some key things to get you started include:



Genre: Generally it pays to stick to one genre per blog if you're an individual. For example, unless you have an amazing knack, readers are less enthused by a blog that combines political opinions, recipes, an examination of existential angst literature, your latest movie reviews, and how to sew clothes for kids all in the one blog. The exception is for instructional sites that put themselves out into the blogosphere with a cadre of writers writing across different fields. If you want to spread yourself more broadly, there are two avenues - either have a variety of blogs if you have the time to maintain them, or dedicate one blog to the ""self-introspective"" stuff for a hobby and maintain another serious single genre or topic blog separately, with an eye to making it popular with readers.

Length of posts: There is no hard and fast rule because it depends on the content, the quality, the message, and the audience. Certainly, a lot has been written about brevity being important but so is getting the full picture where this is warranted. Keeping in mind that most online readers have fleeting attention spans, judge length by how your readers respond, the utility of your information, and the subject matter. Consider mixing up lengths of posts, to give readers a break in between the more lengthy and ""erudite"" ones!

Layout: Headers are useful; subheadings help break up large topics and pictures and give the eyes a rest. Block quotes can work well, and leaving space allows the reader to feel relaxed, not rushed or overwhelmed. Try to use short paragraphs, no matter the length of the post. Use bolding to draw out important points and to capture the attention of the reader (bolding also interests the search engine but that's another matter).

Frequency: Too few posts and people will think you've wandered off; and so too will they. Too many and you'll wear readers out – remember that they have other things to read and do! Reader and writer burnout is a real issue when you over-post, so think through carefully what works best for you. Keep in mind the reality that search engines like a good frequency of regular posts.

Editing: Check your spelling and your grammar. Never underestimate the importance of this. Your expertise in the blog content won't shine if your spelling is questionable.







Revise, revise, revise: Cut it out if in doubt and say it with less. The polishing aspect can sometimes take longer than the original write-up but it's worth the effort to ensure that your readers remain captivated.







, Even if you're a brilliant author, words alone won't make a blog. Most readers expect the blog to look impressive, and to be accompanied by at least one photo or image. Visuals add sparkle and capture people's attention. As with anything, don't overuse them – just seek to get the balance right.


Use your common sense when assessing how much is too much – if you're adding a photography, how-to, or recipe post, you'll be able to get away with more photos than say, a political or opinion piece blog post.

, You could have the most relevant information on the topic, but if it has a boring title, it won't be read. Use headlines that draw in readers and that search engines latch onto. The search engine element is an art in and of itself which you'll eventually find yourself learning more about. For now, however, some key pointers to bear in mind include:

Use words that marketers use to capture attention. There are several ""Top 10 English Words"" lists available online used by marketers to grab attention (do a search for one). Adding words like ""you"" to the title may sound banal but according to marketing research, strategic use of the top 10 words can bring readers to open links to your post.







Ask questions in headings or create dangling information that has the reader wondering what the next piece of information will be. Make your heading tantalizing so that it prods the reader into wanting to read more - if your heading speaks to a need in a reader, then they'll love it. Top of the list is ""How to...""!
Keep the title simple. The simpler, the better, and try to keep the title less than 40 characters and the search engine will also love your blog!







, People will read your words of wisdom but they won't tell you what they think because the majority of people (and that means around 99 percent) won't unless prompted. You'll get a significantly larger number of comments if you ask for them.

Don't close down your comments feature. It's important not to fear comments - they're a pulse on your blog, letting you know that people are responding to your blogging, whether negatively or positively. If your blog is really good, you'll get both sides of the responses, which is ideal!






Make it easy for your readers to comment. Readers don't want to jump through hoops. Balance making them sign in and using CAPTCHA fixes before they can say a single line with the fact that this will cause many of them to not bother at all. The fewer hurdles, the better, especially where personal information is concerned.






Always end your blog posts encouraging comments by asking questions, or asking for experiences and suggestions from the reader.






Without fail, respond to your commenters. Not only is that polite to the person who took the time to comment but it lets other readers know that you care and engage with them. They are looking! An obvious exception is spamming or flaming, in which case, either remove the comment (spam) as soon as possible, or let it stand on its own lack of merits (flaming) unless you have a witty and kind response.
Remove spam as soon as you can. It looks unprofessional. Invest in a way of keeping spam off - there are plenty of programs available. Find good ways to clean up spam that don't involve chasing off your genuine readers.

, Use today's social media to the max. There are many platforms to choose from. Use one, or preferably, many of them. Twitter, Facebook, Digg, and Tumblr are just a few.


Take time to visit other blogger's blogs and leave comments with your name and link in them. Get known as someone who cares about what other bloggers are saying and creating, and they'll repay the favor.







, Guest posting is an excellent means for getting well-known, quality bloggers to increase the profile of your blog. Offer guest posts in return, so as to get your blog's link into other people's blogs.


Guest posts increase variety for your readers. And if you get well-known bloggers on your blog, this will help your readers to connect you with the guest poster, which will increase your profile.

, Show your readers that you appreciate them. Give back to them by:


Responding to your reader's comments promptly.
Visiting your reader's blogs if they have them. Leave supportive comments and even suggest they guest blog for you now and then.

Remember that fellow bloggers are also readers.,
Provide quality content.,
Make time for fellow bloggers.,
Chill on disrespecting other bloggers.,
Know and respect the blogger's code of ethics or code of conduct.,
Be honest about your information sources.,
Use your own bandwidth.,
Learn from constructive criticism.",How to Earn the Respect of Other Bloggers," That means, when you're aiming to earn their appreciation, you're aiming to provide information that readers will want to read as well as share with people they know. Fellow bloggers are readers-with-benefits; if they like your blog, it's probable that they'll try to connect with you, share your content, and promote you. They may seek to get you guest blogging for them, or they may ask if they can guest blog for you.;
, As noted in the previous step, your fellow bloggers are also potential readers. As such, respect from other bloggers will come when they realize that you're providing original, interesting, and consistent content. While this might seem self-evident, there are many blogs out there that don't match this single most important requirement, such as blogs the simply regurgitate the news, other people's blog content, or don't even try to present something interesting to the audience. Other blogs overstep the mark by being nothing but a marketing vehicle for a single product that smells awfully of pyramid selling or a fly-by-night operation. None of these things attract the respect of other bloggers. Things to bear in mind when creating quality content include:


Use original opinions to put an interesting slant on the information you're providing. Even if everyone has read it before, a new slant with original thought can have people thinking again.
Use references. Don't expect other people to just take you at your word for factual statements; provide them with the evidence. As part of this, be sure to make it easy for them to find the resources that you used – no wild goose chases or made-up stuff.

, Take the time to answer their questions about your own blog. Visit their blogs and read and comment on their efforts. Create reciprocal relationships by being involved in what they're saying and doing too.


Ask your favorite bloggers if they're like to share a guest post on your blog. Offer to guest post on their blogs as well as offering them guest post opportunities on your blog.
Network with other bloggers continuously. Stay in touch with what they're doing and spread it via your Twitter and Facebook accounts; this shows that you care about what they're saying. Attend their online and real life talks and seminars if you can. And join social media network groups; a number of these are set up on sites such as LinkedIn. And develop a plan for how you will cultivate and increase your contacts.Be interactive with reader's comments. Bloggers leave comments too, and you may or may not know that those who have left comments are bloggers. Regardless of that, it's just good etiquette to respond to comments where you're able to, as it keeps readers engaged and alerts other bloggers to your blog being an interactive one (meaning it's well tended and cared for!).

, If you start singling out bloggers and picking on them, or being negative about them, you're taking a very big risk. Maybe this is what you want from your blog but bear in mind that the following problems arise from this prickly approach:


Bloggers who support the attacked blogger will band together. And together they are a much wider source of spreading negative information about you if it's clear you're being spiteful, untruthful, or intimidating.
Being in a war with another blogger or group of bloggers does not make for interesting reading. You stand to lose a lot of readers if this is what your content ends up reflecting.
It's hard to trust someone who appears as if they can turn at a mere moment and start undermining you. By attacking another blogger, other bloggers won't know whether this is something you'll turn around and do to them or not.
Know the difference between constructive criticism and outright damnation and unkindness. You do have a role in pointing out errors and misunderstandings in a reasoned and evidenced way, but your don't have a role in dragging the person through the mud. Always focus on the issue, not the person.

, There are several variations of this idea floating around the internet but the basics can be filtered down to some of the following listed next. The important thing is that by following this code, you're likely to increase the potential for respect from other bloggers because you can demonstrate that you remain dedicated to using the blog as an informative, considerate, and non-combative medium. Some of the ideas involved in the various codes include:Be responsible for what you opine. If you think something, make it clear that it's you who thinks it.
Monitor your blog comments. Remove those that are hateful and inflammatory towards others.
Be honest and fair, don't plagiarize, avoid distorting images, and make lack of certainty or fact evident. Avoid publishing inaccurate information (do your research).
Don't misrepresent fact. Make it clear when you're writing opinion, fact, commentary, advocacy, or conjecture and avoid mixing them up.
The facts do matter even if they get in the way of a good retelling. Check your facts.
Don't hide advertising in your commentary or general write-up. Be open about what's marketing and advertising.
Be considerate of those who might be harmed by what you're writing. Think about privacy, respect, defamation, and intent when ""exposing"" people or activities.
Be sensitive when discussing minors, lurid issues, tragedy, or grief; err on the side of protecting private people's privacy and not crossing the boundaries of good taste.
Admit it when you make errors and do all you can to remedy them and repair your relationships to rebuild trust. Publicly correct misinformation that you've blogged; go back to the errant post and make it clear with a postscript that you've retracted the errors too (for example, strike through erroneous information).And don't feel you have to be ""perfect"" – nobody is and to expect that is unrealistic.Indeed, when you fluff up, you seem more real than ever and that's reassuring for most readers.
Disclose conflicts of interest, affiliations, and personal agendas. You can still have a field day with your personal affiliations provided people know where you're coming from.
Don't be unethical and don't stand for unethical practices in other bloggers.

, Not being honest about sources upsets other bloggers a great deal; ""borrowing"" (or to put it more bluntly, ""stealing"") their material, whether it's text or images, is infuriating. If you do this and you refuse to acknowledge where the information came form, you won't ever earn their respect. The best approaches are as follows:


Give credit where credit is due. Always credit your sources, even if they are just a source for ideas. It will be seen by other bloggers and the favor will be returned.
Make original source links clear. When you do put in the link to the original source, don't hide it. Allow it to be seen without it having to be looked for.
Don't watermark the images you use with your blog link. Doing this is cheesy. If it's a photo blog, you'll want to find some ways to protect yourself. As the original photographer, this is certainly acceptable. However, if they aren't your images, use hotlink protection for those images that you want to protect that aren't yours.

, Something that has worn out numerous website and blog owners over time is the use of their bandwidth. This has resulted in many people closing down their sites or blogs as a result of it not being affordable. Support your fellow blogger by hosting the images that you're using and not linking to theirs. And acknowledge where the photos hail from.

, You will receive criticism as a blogger. See it as a learning experience, and try to improve your blogging approach, especially when the suggestions come from another blogger. In fact, other bloggers are an amazing pool of knowledge and resources for you to tap into, so if they do offer you advice on what to do better, consider this free training!


Nasty criticism from another blogger will be seen for what it is. Don't take it to heart, keep a sense of humor and make up your mind whether to reply at all, or just to give a brief reply that doesn't engage the nastiness but merely concedes the point of what could be done better, or brushes off the attack in a kindly, amused fashion.
Respect your readers. Don't be condescending to them (unless that is your 'thing' and it's what the readers expect and enjoy about your blog). Treat them as equals.
Show the same respect to others that you are trying to earn.

Register a Domain Name.,
Find a Host.,
Install Joomla.,
Now that you have your DNS record and Folder in place, you will need to actually perform the Joomla installation.,
Once your Joomla site has been installed and is capable of being surfed to.,
Once you have logged into the ""back-end"" of your site, you should see what's called the ""Control Panel"" (not to be confused with your host's C-Panel)...but once logged in you should see a similar image:

",How to Create Your Own Website With Joomla,"


Registering a domain name can be done through numerous Registrar's, just do a Google search and make sure it's a suitable available name . One that you are committed to using.

Example Registrar: http://www.godaddy.com

Example Registrar: http://www.tucows.com


;
, You'll need one unless you are planning on hosting your own server.


You will need a Hosting environment. The hosting environment is basically the place you store your files and folders.
You can create your own hosting servers and even DNS servers if you wanted to but that involves hardware you might not have.
This can be done by finding a suitable ""Host"" via a Google search, just remember to compare prices. (If you are opting to purchasing a Hosting service sure to get a host that offers a C-panel or c-panel like interface to your service. Some Registrar's even offer hosting too.)

, After you have your domain name registered, your host access, & and a few minutes to spare, you are ready to install Joomla, but before we actually install we will need to do 3 more simple steps.


Login to your Host's Server (At this point everything is kind of assuming you have a UI similar to C-Panel)
Create a directory (folder) in your hosting environment via your C-Panel interface to your server (the host) ., Call the folder whatever seems relative, then remember it. FYI the stereo typical will be: /htdocs/new folder or w/e
Create your DNS pointer record to the folder we created, This can also be done via the C-Panel, just look for Domain control or something specifying your administration over your domains. Once there, update or create a new pointer record stating: (Usually via a Drop Down Menu field and a Text field.) .....www,yourdomainname,com -is equal to- /htdocs/new folder ... Save the pointer record.

, This is fairly automated in most cases when using C-Panel and extension's ""Simple Scripts"" or other CMS installers.


Find your Installer script in your C-Panel, when installing you are just going to specify a few data fields. Specifically your Domain Name you wish to be installing Joomla for, (selected usually by a drop down menu list compiled of all your domain names you have records for)

Define what domain/folder your going to install Joomla into.
Define which Mysql Database you are going to use for your site, (This is usually done more or less automatic, just need to fill out a few fields of data during the scripted installation, basically defining the database name & database admin username & password)


Provide Admin Login Data. (Obviously be sure to remember this) & Basic Site Data..
SELECT WHAT VERSION YOU WANT TO INSTALL
Submit/Save/Create/Install w/e the button is called to initializes the script
Once the installer script has ran its course, you should be able to go to your website via your internet browser like anyone else would. (Assuming your DNS record has been properly set)
To make changes to the site, via the ""back-end"" ..Just surf to www,yourdomainname,com/administrator & use your admin log in information you defined during installation.

, Log in to the ""back-end"" as Administrator and you can ...create / install / modify... the following: (OR SKIP TO STEP 6 for Quick Example of How to build a ""Home"" page and a ""Contact Us"" page.

Install the ecommerce extension you downloaded.,

Make your first sale!",How to Create an Ecommerce Website from Scratch Using Joomla," A domain name is what defines your brand on the Internet. Some popular domain names are google.com, facebook.com, wordpress.org, etc. Your domain name should indicate the industry your company or business is associated with. For example, if you are selling used cars in Australia, you can opt for a name such as usedcarsaustralia.com. This is a crucial aspect in determining how effective your business website is in terms of SEO rankings. Use GoDaddy.com or a similar service to buy a domain.


Search for the domain name you wish to purchase. Do not feel let down if you can't find the name of your choice, continue with the search till you eventually come across one that is suitable.;
, As human beings, we are required to have homes for living. Think about hosting as your website home where all data files and databases are located. Purchasing a domain name and hosting service are two different things and need to be done separately. Avoid purchasing a hosting plan that sounds too good to be true (you know the ones that read unlimited everything, very cheap, and all that).


Once you have purchased your hosting company, go back to the GoDaddy domain management tool. Change the name servers on the domain so that it points to your new hosting company.
The hosting company will usually send the name servers through their welcome email. The name servers take some time before they propagate and sometimes you may be required to wait for as long as 48 hours.

, Download the latest version available in the market, which right now is Joomla 3.3. Download the software from a trusted source such as joomla.org. Click on the ZIP link next to the Full Package tab, the first such entry you come across while scrolling down the page. Depending on the speed of your Internet connection, your download process will start.

, Now that Joomla has been downloaded, it is time to upload it to the hosting account that you have purchased.


One way of uploading Joomla is by extracting it locally and subsequently FTPing all source files to the hosting account. If this is the only website you have associated with the particular hosting company, then you should FTP the same over to public_html.
An alternate and faster means of getting the job done is by going to the cPanel on the hosting account. Go over to File Manager, upload the Joomla zip file and then have it extracted under the public_html directory.

, Once Joomla has been uploaded to the server, it is time to create the database where all relevant website data will be stored. Once again, head over to the cPanel on your hosting account. Search for the MySQL Database Wizard under the Databases tag. Click on the same and follow the instructions to install it.


Store important database related data such as password, username and database name in a safe place. You will need them at a later stage.

, Point the browser to your relevant website URL. You will be required to configure Joomla as per your hosting service. Note that in case you are not using GoDaddy as your hosting provider, leave the tab under host name set to local host. Congratulations, your website is now up and running!

, Now that your website has become functional, it is time you add some relevant information to it. Start by designing the website home page, about us page and contact us page before you fill in all other relevant content. Creating these pages is a very straightforward and simple process.


Use a reputed website design company to easily and effectively build a satisfactory website that bears crisp and relevant business information.

, While your website is fully operational and working, you are still in need of a store so that your business can actually prosper. The best way to do so is by downloading and installing an ecommerce solution like VirtueMart. An extension for the Joomla development software, it is available for free download at http://virtuemart.net/downloads. The latest stable version available at present is VirtueMart 2.6.8 which is compatible with all of the latest Joomla development versions.

, Whether you chose VirtueMart or a similar solution, installing the extension for Joomla is a very simple procedure. If you are looking to install a theme for your website, search for a relevant theme on Google search and then install it using the same steps as mentioned above.


Start by going to the Extensions Manager tab. Locate the site where you have downloaded the VirtueMart file in your machine. Upload the downloaded file to the host service website. Once you complete the upload process, VirtueMart will install automatically.

, So now you have a store in place but you still have to include products in it. Follow the Components -> VirtueMart route in the Joomla control panel and set up your eCommerce store. First, create the main setting for your store. This will primarily include the payment options such as PayPal accounts, shipping options, notifications for customers, etc. Then create your store's categories. For instance, in the used cars website example, there may be a category for Spare Parts and one for Services. Finally, add a name, description, image, and price for each of the products that you list on the website.


If you are planning to offer downloadable content for your customers, you need to first upload this content.

, Design a menu item that will serve as a link to your online store. In the Joomla control panel, follow the Menus -> Main Menu path. Click on the New tab on the top right hand corner if you wish to add a new menu item. Then click Menu Item Type and finally choose VirtueMart.

, Once you have followed all of these steps down to the very last detail, you will have an online shop that is ready for business. It is time for you to make your first online sell.

, This can be a phone, a tablet, a point-and-shoot digital camera, or a professional-grade DSLR camera with advanced settings. You should pick whatever falls within your comfort zone and stick to it.


If you want a dedicated camera, read up on your options before choosing one.

, You'll need to transfer them to your computer for the editing and uploading process.


If you have a phone or tablet, you can connect to the internet and upload your photos either to the Tumblr app directly, or to the cloud (iCloud or Google Drive).
If you have a dedicated camera, you'll need a USB cable. These normally come with new cameras. You can also buy one at any store that sells cameras or their accessories, or you can buy one online.

You can also remove a camera's memory card and plug it into your computer if your computer has an SD slot.



, All Windows and Apple computers come with basic editing capabilities in their respective photo applications, while you can purchase more advanced programs like Photoshop from online.



Instagram is a great free alternative available for iOS, Android, and Windows phones and tablets. It includes some basic editing features such as filters and lighting adjustments. After editing, you can save Instagram photos to your phone or computer.
Photoshop is as cheap as $9.99/month, and it provides more than enough tools to extensively edit your photos., To ensure the greatest possible quality, should focus on one specific subject.


Tumblr pictures tend to focus on a single subject in a simple setting, such as a solitary chess piece on a board or a single tree against a backdrop of grass.

, Digital zoom only enlarges the picture on your screen, which leads to pixelation. If you need a close-up shot, simply move closer to your subject.

, Unless you’re shooting a sunrise/sunset or a similar scene, your subject should always be illuminated, not backlit.


When shooting indoors, experiment with your subject placement. Repositioning your subject to be frontlit—illuminated by light from behind you—rather than backlit will increase your photo’s quality immensely. , You should be as still as possible; motion will blur your picture.

, The rule of thirds is a photography technique where you mentally separate your picture into a three-by-three grid, then position important elements of the picture to intersect the grid lines. This technique is deemed more pleasing to the eye than placing a subject in the middle of the screen.For example, if you were shooting a picture of a coast line, the bottom third of the photo would probably be the sand, the middle third would be the ocean, and the top third would be the sky.
You can enable a three-by-three grid for most phones' screens in the “Camera” section of the “Settings” menu., A blurry or darkened subject is very difficult to fix while editing.

, Your subject and any areas you deem important should be the main focus of your picture, keeping in mind the rule of thirds.

, The areas surrounding your subject are also important, since they emphasize the scale and setting of your subject. Though your subject should be the most in focus, it shouldn’t be the only thing in the frame.

, You should take several shots from the same angle, then switch to a different angle and take more. This will ensure that at least one of your photos achieves your desired result.


If you're using a phone, try holding it in one hand while taking the picture with the other. This will increase your stability, which impacts the quality of the photo.

, Almost all digital cameras have an LCD screen on the back that will allow you to view your picture immediately after taking it.

, It's better to take too many pictures than too few. After you're satisfied with your pictures, you can move on to editing and uploading them!

, If you shot on a phone, you can upload the pictures to iCloud or Google Drive, or you can email them to yourself. You can then download from your cloud service.


If you shot on a camera, connect the small end of your camera’s USB cable to the camera and the large end to your computer. Follow the on-screen instructions to download your photos.

, Some criteria to keep in mind are stability of the image, the rule of thirds, and the overall aesthetic appeal. Once you've found your photo, you may proceed to edit it.


You should make a copy of this picture to act as a backup.

, How you do this will vary depending on your picture’s composition and your editing software choice, but you should adjust features such as:


Contrast, which determines the amount of difference between light colors and dark colors. A photo with low contrast will appear dull, while high contrast will have bright colors and black shadows.
Saturation, which is the amount of color in your picture (black-and-white photos have zero saturation).
Highlights, which dictate how bright the light sections in your photo are.

, Brightness, sharpness, and the green/blue/red settings are all standard in photo editing software--explore the different settings to see what effects they have on your picture. You can always start over if you make a mistake.

, Filters are common on sites and apps such as Instagram. They add a specific color theme to your photo without adjusting any composition settings.


For example, some filters wash out all of the bright colors, while others emphasize them.

, Once you save it, your picture is ready for Tumblr!

,, Make sure you log into the account to which you’d like to upload your picture.

, This should be located at the top of the page.,, You have successfully created and posted a quality Tumblr picture!


You can also add text or a description to your photo from this step.

It should be about something you love talking about and know much about. Something fun and creative. Honestly speaking, no one will be interested on how you got through your day. People need help, they need entertainment, and you're going to give it to them.;
, If you wants to be a professional blogger then, make a business plan or road map. To run your blog smoothly it's necessary step that you have to take. Write down about everything you could imagine to do with your blog. Think, How to run your blog? How to maintain the quality of your article? Make some strategies to run your blog for long time.

, Add up good looking templates. Hosts like WordPress and Blogger provide good looking templates which you can use to make your blog look attractive.

, While you blog, make sure you are having fun. Don't blog with the intention of being bored or tired. If you get tired or frustrated quickly, blogging probably isn't for you.

, It would be best if you could post a minimum of one post per day on your blog. People don't like to wait for days for new posts. Make sure you're a regular blogger. This will keep you viewers interested and come back for more and eventually follow the blog! For this you can use reblogged button effectively. This button is very helpful to updated your blog on regular basis. You can copy paste for this also but, with the permission of their original writers and give credit to them for that.

, At times talk to your audience about yourself. If it's about a car, talk to them about your experience. Also having an ""About"" navigation which will tell your audience about your blog is a very great idea.

, Don't expect your posts to go viral in a matter of days. Blogs take months or even years to get decent fans. All you need to do is keep posting and never give up. This has been the leading cause to shut-down blogs.

, Take opinions from your viewers, ask them what they are interested in and how they can help you. Think of it as a community, where you need to get to them and they need to get back to you.

Publish the page.",How to Add a Guestbook to a Blogger Blog1," Guestbooks rely on script files in order to collect and display responses. Since you don't have the ability to upload scripts to Blogger blogs, you'll need to link to a guestbook that is hosted on another site. This will require you to create an account on this site so that you can manage and store your guestbook. There are free and paid options, depending on your needs. You'll be generating your guestbook on another website, and then copying the code for the book into a new page on your blog.;
, There are a variety of different services available that can generate and host a guestbook. Different services will offer different features. A few of the most popular services are listed below, and most are free:


Bravenet - Bravenet.com offers free guestbooks, and you can choose different designs and add smilies for guests to use. The Bravenet guestbook will appear directly on your blog. Bravenet gives you the most control over your guestbook design out of all of the options listed here.
123Guestbook - This free guestbook only takes a few moments to setup,but offers less customization than Bravenet.
Ultraguest - This guestbook has a lot of moderation features, including private messaging.
SnapHost - SnapHost is a paid guestbook service that offers CAPTCHA and anti-spam functions. It's actually a CAPTCHA service first and foremost that includes a guestbook among its features. Choose this option if the other features appeal to you as well, otherwise it's probably not worth it for just the guestbook.

, All of the services listed above require you to create an account. You'll use this account to manage your guestbook settings, since they can't be managed from your blog. This is because the actual guestbook database is located on the guestbook service's servers.


You'll be prompted to enter your blog's address when creating your account. This will allow the service to connect to assign the guestbook to your website so that replies are properly tracked.

, Once you have created your account, you can begin customizing your guestbook. Depending on the service, you may have to open the guestbook's control panel. For example, 123Guestbook will send you the link to the control panel in your registration confirmation email.


If you're using Bravenet, you'll need to click the ""More Web Tools"" link on your dashboard, and then click ""Register"" next to ""Guestbook"".

, Use the guestbook editor or control panel to customize it to your liking. If you're using Bravenet, you can edit all of the colors so that it matches the theme of your Blogger blog exactly. You can typically choose from a variety of preset themes that will make setting up the guestbook quicker.

, Get the code for your guestbook. After you've finished customizing your guestbook, you'll want to grab the embed code for it so that you can add it to your blog. In Bravenet, click the ""Get Code"" link to open a new window. Select ""Get Code to Embed"" and then copy the code from the box.If you selected 123Guestbook, you'll need to create a link to the guestbook's URL. You can find the code for the link in the ""Extras"" section control panel menu.

, Putting your guestbook on a page instead of a post will allow you to easily link to it or create a menu option for it. Log into Blogger, select your blog, and click the ""Pages"" option. Click ""New page"" to open a new blank page.

, This code will embed the guestbook into your page. You won't be able to see it in Preview mode. Turn off Reader Comments in the page's Settings menu to remove the comment box from the page so that it doesn't clash with the guestbook.

, Once you've published the page, you'll be able to visit it and see your guestbook. Any visitor that comes to this page will see the guestbook.


You can link to this page or add it to your blog's navigation bar so that visitors can easily find it. To quickly add a navigation menu, select the ""Layout"" option and then click ""Add gadget"". Select ""Pages"" from the list of gadgets to add a navigation bar.

Know when to use this method.,
Log into Blogger and create a new page.,
Create an introduction.,
Publish the page.",How to Add a Guestbook to a Blogger Blog2," If you'd rather not deal with signing up for a guestbook service, you can actually use Blogger's built-in comment features to create your own pseudo-guestbook. The comments can act as guestbook entries.

, You'll likely want your guestbook to occupy a separate page so that you can easily link to it and add a menu item for it. Open your blog from the Blogger dashboard and click ""Pages"". Select ""New page"" to open a blank page in the editor.

, You'll want to let the reader know that they're on the guestbook page. Include an introduction and a prompt to get the reader interested in leaving a guestbook comment. Ask them to leave specific information that a guestbook would ask for, such as location and personal website. Direct the reader to fill out the Comments field to leave a guestbook response.

, Once you're satisfied with the way the guestbook intro looks, you can publish it so that it's publicly available. You'll want to add a link to it on your home page or add it to your blog's navigation bar.


You can quickly add a navigation bar by opening the Layout section and selecting ""Add gadget"". Select ""Pages"" from the list of basic gadgets, and enable your guestbook page.

Pick a topic with some longevity, something that you can write about regularly. Fresh content needs to be produced on a regular basis if you want to keep your newly acquired readers and be visible in search engines. Be sure to check out your competition before settling upon a subject. You may well be passionate about the news but in reality how many news sites are there online already?;
, Wordpress is an ultra-flexible platform that is free to download and install. All you have to do is find a compatible website hosting provider.

, If you are an experienced web designer, you might choose to do design it yourself. If you've no previous experience or technical know-how then pick a set theme. There are many free options available online.

, There are many weapons available in the internet entrepreneur's arsenal, choosing the right one for you can take time. You could choose banner advertising, Google AdSense, affiliate marketing, e-book sales, product sales, sponsorships, text ads, membership sales; there really are a myriad of different ways to turn a profit online.


Balance monetization and reader enjoyment. That popup banner might make you some money, but if it irritates people enough to leave your site before they've read your content then you've missed the real opportunity.
Be careful not to under-monetize your site. Be sure to test, analyze and review your ad placements and monetization methods.

, This is the important step. Without your unique and useful content, your site is just like the other websites that launch and fail every single day around the world. Add something to the web, don't copy and paste or regurgitate. Your niche might be crowded but you can still establish a unique voice. It goes without saying that proofreading and a bit of sub-editing are key to a successful website. Spelling mistakes put off most readers almost instantly.

If you have your own host, you can install the WordPress software for free.
If you want to run ads on your blog, you will need to host it yourself. This is also true if you want to install custom themes or manually adjust the blog’s code.

HostGator
DreamHost
Go Daddy

, Most webhosts provide customers with a control panel (cPanel) that allows you to control the operation of your website.

, Most webhosts will have Wordpress already loaded and ready to install. Simply scroll down on your cPanel and look for the WordPress installation link. This is usually located in the Scripts category.You will be asked to create an admin username and password for your blog.

, If your webhost does not provide WordPress preinstalled, you will need to upload it to your webserver. To do this, download the script from the WordPress.org website.


Connect to your webhost via FTP. Upload the WordPress files to the root of your domain. If you want WordPress to exist in a subdomain on your site, create the folder for the subdomain and place the WordPress files in that folder.
Open the webpage where you uploaded the WordPress files to. You will see an option to run the installation script. Click the link and WordPress will install itself.

, Once the script has been installed, your WordPress blog is ready to use. Open the blog in your web browser, and log in with your administrator information. This will take you to your Dashboard, where you will be able to control all of the aspects of your blog.

Be relatable to your followers yet be a creative inspiration.",How to Make a Hipster Tumblr,"  In this day and age, it is well known that hipsters like to be original, and will often criticize others for not being so. To help you combat this issue, it is great to start off by setting an appealing theme for both your online and mobile Tumblr.  Most hipster blogs have a theme that is hip, yet simple.  For example, a popular hipster Tumblr has a white background with cartoon-looking cacti all over it.  It's out of the box, but its cool because not many people have it.  It's the perfect example of a  theme for those aspiring hipsters out there.
,  Nothing screams originality better than a witty tittle that makes your followers think, ""wow, this person is super cool and I wish I was that creative.""  The shorter the title, the better.  You want your followers to realize how hip and carefree you are, since hipsters are supposed to be original and apathetic.,  Many hipster blogs like to reblog pictures of random items that are weird, but unique.  A popular example is a picture of boxed water that says, ""Boxed water is better.""  Boxed water makes no sense, but since it's unique and differs from the norm, it's cool and hip.,  If you constantly reblog hipster pictures such as Urban Outfitters clothing and bands that the majority of the population doesn't know about, you will have a successful hipster Tumblr.,  Constantly reblog funny and/or apathetic text posts that your followers can relate to.  If they can relate to your posts, then they can relate to your blog and you will most likely gain followers.  Be creative in the sense that you reblog posts that are cool and fit the hipster aesthetic as it will make you Tumblr famous."

Start off with a clear sheet of white paper.,
Draw a neat circle or square on the paper.,
Fill the circle or square with water.,
Take the brightest colour you want to use and paint a cloud-like shape in the middle of the circle or square.,
Paint around the edge of the square or circle with black paint.,
Take a lighter shade of the bright cloud colour used earlier and add highlights in and around the cloud.

,
Leave the painting to dry.",How to Make a Tumblr‐Inspired Star or Galaxy Painting," It's best to use cartridge/watercolour paper so it doesn't wrinkle up as much or let the water run through. Watercolour paper can be found in pretty much any art store or supermarket.;
, You'll want to do this lightly whilst either using a ruler or drawing around something. This is so you know where the paint and water need to stop - a bit like colouring inside the lines.

, Brush it on lightly and thinly - you don't want too much water as it'll spill cover the line and also make the paint harder to control. However, you don't want to make the water layer too thin, as it'll dry too quickly.

, Don't worry if it runs a bit in the water; that's the effect you want to see. Take a darker shade of this colour and add this to the edges of the cloud, as if defining it. Dot the darker shade through the cloud slightly as well to add yet more definition.

, Paint it black up until you reach the cloud and leave a gap between the black and the cloud. Take a navy blue and paint between the cloud and the black, blending the dark tones with the lighter tones.

,, Once it's dried, Take a watery paintbrush loaded up with white and hold it above the painting. Still holding it over the painting, tap on the paintbrush so small white dots appear on the painting. Keep doing this until the painting looks like a galaxy filled with stars. For extra effect, you can turn some of the bigger dots into shapes like '+' to it looks like the bigger ones are shining.

, Drupal is amazing software, but it's not always the right choice. Using the 'right' software (for your specific project) is always better than using the 'best' software - if that existed., It's worth considering other popular CMSs like WordPress and Joomla, or 'cloud-hosted' CMSs like WordPress.com and Drupal Gardens.

You could also use website-building software to help you build the website from scratch (using a drag-and-drop interface), or you could learn to code the website from scratch, if you have enough time. How to Start Making a Website explains these options well.
If you'd like to test it, you can use simplytest.me. Type 'Drupal' in the search box, choose 'Drupal core', then select the latest (highest) version from the selection box. Then launch it, and have fun!

,,, When you've logged into your site, you'll see the website covering most of the screen, with a black bar covering the top, with a few buttons. The 'Menu' button makes the main administration menu show up just below it. 'Shortcuts' provides a little menu that's all yours (you choose what's in the menu).

You can add or remove a link to any administration page in this menu. Just click on the little star next to the page's title. The button with your name allows you to log out, among other things. The pencil button makes all the 'editable' areas on the current webpage visible with pencil icons in their upper-right corners.

When you have one of the menus open, you'll see an 'arrow and line' icon on the right, which toggles (switches) the menu between appearing at the top, or on the left of the screen.



, This screen shows all the webpages of your website, as well as other kinds of content. You can filter (narrow down) which content is shown on this page. Do this by selecting from or typing into the fields below the 'Add content' button, and clicking the 'Update' button.,
On the 'Create Basic page' screen, you'll see a typical CMS-style webpage-editing screen (it looks very similar to other CMSs like WordPress, and has buttons similar to Microsoft Office Word), so it should look familiar!, You can format the text, insert images, and so on. On the right are expandable sections with more options, like the option to create a link in a menu, and decide whether you want to publish your article or keep it as a draft., The preview option at the bottom lets you see your new webpage the way it'll look when you've saved it (but it doesn't save it yet), and lets you edit it more before it's finished. When you are finished editing, click the 'Save and publish' button, or click the right side of the button with the little triangle for other options., That way, you can understand what they mean when professionals write or speak about them. In Drupal, 'Basic pages' and 'Articles' are called content types, or more generically, bundles of content.

Each one of these (each page, for instance) is called a node. Also, these content nodes, as well as users, comments, files, and a few other things are all called entities. Entities are powerful and useful concepts, because they are all fieldable (meaning, for example, users can have a 'profile picture' field).







, Articles look and act just like the basic webpages, but they should be used in a different way. While the content on a webpage is 'static' (it doesn't change much, and it isn't particularly time-sensitive), articles are similar to posts in a journal or on a blog; they're relevant when they're new and fresh. They're useful for blog posts or news stories.


Articles usually have comments turned on (to encourage visitor interaction), and have a field at the bottom called 'Tags'. Tags allow you to categorise articles so that they're easier to find for visitors. You can add as many tags as you want to each article. Tags are called taxonomy terms in Drupal; they can be edited at 'Structure' > 'Taxonomy'. There, you can add other taxonomies as well (like 'categories'), and arrange them hierarchically (one within another).

,, Blocks are often pieces of content that you can place into special areas on any Drupal page; these areas are called regions. For example, a block could be a snippet or except of an article, or a little gallery of thumbnail images. Blocks can also be interactive elements with specific functions, such as a search box, or a contact form.


When you go to the 'Structure' > 'Block layout' page, you'll see a table on the left, and a gray area with links on the right. The table has bold headings; these are the regions, such as Header, Sidebar first, Footer, etc. Under each region name are the blocks, such as 'Main page content' and 'Search'; these blocks have been created automatically by modules (such as the Views module).

You can rearrange these blocks using the arrow icons or the selection boxes. You can also create new copies of existing blocks using the links in the right area.


You can create new 'custom' blocks by clicking on the 'Add custom block' button; you can add any content you like to a block (text, images, etc.), just like a basic page. These blocks you create are stored in the 'Custom block library' tab.
On the 'Block layout' page, click on the 'Demonstrate block regions' link to see all the regions that your theme provides, and where they are on the page; regions are specific to the theme that is currently active, which is Bartik by default.

, Menus are simply collections of links to webpages (either on your website, or somewhere else on the internet). In Drupal, you can create as many menus as you like, with as many links as you like, and you can place these menus in any region on any webpage as a block (even in the footer).


To create or edit a menu, go to 'Structure' > 'Menus'. Here you'll see 5 menus that have been created by Drupal already; you can click on the 'Edit menu' button beside each to see the links it has.
You can create a new menu using the 'Add menu' button. You can then start adding links directly to the menu, however it's usually far easier to add specific pages (or other types of content) to a menu by using the 'Provide a menu link' option in the 'Menu settings' section on the editing page of that webpage.

, Themes are what defines what a website looks like, and in some ways, how it functions. For instance, a Drupal theme can set the colours, fonts, and icons of your website, as well as each page's layout, and some appearance-related functionality (like changing the way the menu works depending on the device the visitor is using).

Drupal themes are usually either made for the website as it's seen by visitors (called the front-end), or for the administrators when they log in (called the back-end); often called 'admin themes'. While most themes you'll find for Drupal are free, you can find professionally-designed themes that cost money.
To find themes, you can search on Drupal.org (over 1200, all free), ThemeForest (over 200, all paid), TemplateMonster (over 450, all paid), Billion Themes (over 800, paid and free), as well as individual Drupal design studios. Remember to filter the themes to show only those for Drupal 8.
To change to a different theme, see the article How to Change Themes in Drupal.

,

Drupal is made up of modules, and they provide the functions of the website. Almost anything you want your website to do can be provided by a module.

While most CMSs can be extended using modules/plugins/extensions (or whatever they're called by that CMS), Drupal is a little different because its basic setup (when you first install the standard Drupal download, called Drupal core) is made up of 'core' modules. All new modules you find and install on your website are called contributed (or 'contrib' for short) modules. Note that many modules require other modules to work - this is always explained on the module page.
Deciding which modules to install is a difficult task for every Drupaler, especially if you're new to Drupal. Firstly, you can only install modules that are made for Drupal 8. Also, unless you understand and accept all the risks, you should only install versions of the module that are in the 'Recommended releases' (green) downloads table; not 'dev', 'alpha' or 'beta' versions. There are many factors that determine the quality of the module, so firstly try to choose modules that have a well-written description and instructions (always read this).
Finding and installing modules is very similar to finding and installing themes in Drupal. You can either copy the link to the module and install it using the link, or you can download it and place it in the sites > all > modules folder, then turn it on on the 'Extend' page, and finally configure its settings.

",How to Make a Drupal 8 Theme,"


Begin by sketching the layout of the home page of your website using a pencil and a clean sheet of paper; you need to feel free to make mistakes and changes. Draw all the parts of a basic web-page, including the header, navigation menu (which may be just below the header or in a sidebar), the page body (for the content), and the footer. You may have other areas in your design.
When you’re satisfied with your design, recreate your sketched design a graphics program that allows you to design web pages, such as Adobe Photoshop, or even better, Adobe Fireworks.
Then make sure you add all the other visual elements; consider the colours and dark-light contrasts, the typography and how it adds to the user’s experience, the layout and empty spaces (whitespace is important!), and how content will fit in.;
,


Just like in the website design step, it is probably most efficient to only create the web pages of the site that have their own unique layouts, such as the Home page and Contact Us page. Keep the layout as simple as possible, and use modern practices and conventions where possible (such as HTML5 and CSS3). At this point, don't add any server-side scripting (such as PHP), and keep client-side scripting (such as Javascript) to a minimum, in order to not interfere with Drupal's code; this can be added later.

, Download Drupal and move the files to the server you will use to develop your theme (your testing server - recommended - or an online server).


Place the downloaded files into the root folder (if you're using a testing server, it's the www or localhost folder). Use a web browser to navigate to the root folder (e.g. http://www/) and follow the installation process. You should then install any modules that will be useful for theme development.

,


HTML web pages are known as ‘static’ – which means they aren’t designed to have content that regularly changes – and are built using block-type tags such as ‘divs’ (and ‘header’, ‘footer’, etc. in HTML5).
Drupal web pages are a combination of static parts (HTML) and dynamic parts – parts that contain content that is expected to be changed regularly. These dynamic parts are called ‘regions’ in Drupal. An example of a region is a sidebar, where you might want to insert navigational links, a search box, social media buttons, and so on. See the diagram below for a visual representation:
The things that you can put into regions are called ‘blocks’ in Drupal. For example, a search box or a menu are commonly-used blocks. You can insert blocks into regions, re-arrange the blocks, and remove blocks from regions when you log into Drupal on the Structure > Blocks page. Many of the available blocks in a typical Drupal website are provided by the installed modules, but you can create your own blocks on the Blocks page.
The content of each web page (the body text, headings, images, and so on) are also placed into a region: the ‘Content’ region, which is required for all Drupal themes. The content of each web page (or blog post or custom content type) is called a ‘node’, and is packaged into the Main page content block. In other words, the content of the About Us page is saved into node (with a node type of ‘page’, of course), and is output to the Main page content block, which is placed in the Content region.
Note that sometimes multiple nodes are displayed on one web page through the Main page content block; an example is the front page, which by default shows several of the website’s most recent articles (blog posts).
Your theme will control the regions, but not what the website administrators put into them. As the themer, you have inform Drupal which regions your theme will have, and register them in files called templates, which are covered in the next section.

, In this folder create a .info file which contains the theme's purpose and gives information about how it is used. List what goes into it. In the folder add screenshots. and a CSS folder.

,
Drupal ‘template’ files (that have a file name ending in ‘.html.twig’) are used by Drupal to structure the output of each web page. Standard templates include:


html.html.twig
page.html.twig
block.html.twig
node.html.twig
custom template pages
Each web page that Drupal outputs (the ‘Home page’ for example) will use the html template once, the page template once, and the region, block and node templates at least once each.
If you'd like to see the typical PHP code and HTML markup that goes into each of these templates, you can look at the template files in the directory of the core Drupal themes in the drupal > themes folder (not the drupal > sites > all > themes folder).

,
To understand these functions, you first need to understand how drupal saves and outputs content and HTML markup. As you should have seen in the templates in the previous step, all Drupal templates have several variables available to them that they can output using functions like {{ page}}. In that example, the variable content (which is stored in the page array rather than as a variable by itself; its just how Drupal does it) stores all the text that the user typed into the web page's 'body' when the user was logged into Drupal.
Basically, process and pre-process functions allow the themer to modify any of the variables available to the templates before Drupal makes them available for use by the templates. These functions are all written in the template.php file (note that this is not a '.html.twig' file).

Views. Vital for themers, Views allows you to gather almost any content from your website (such as ‘the 10 most recent articles’) and present it as a page or block. Particularly useful for creating a dynamic home page.

, Re-blogging other blogs distracts other users, possibly making them like you less.

, Sometimes users will comment on a post and it will go on and on until you find yourself scrolling for a long time before seeing a post. If you see them add up, delete the comments which do not add value to the discussion. However, if they all make up a funny text post, then just leave it and laugh along.

, Tumblr is the place where everyone is equal. Nobody superior because of their race, religion, sexuality, etc.

, Make up one that is memorable and easy for people to find. For example, let's say you found this amazing blog on Tumblr. Great theme, they're in the Harry Potter fandom, and they're pretty hilarious as well. You decide to follow them, but a few days later when you want to check them out again, you can't remember their URL because it was hard to memorize.

The purpose of websites
HTML and CSS: how they are used to make websites
PHP: what it is, and how it is used to enhance
CMS's: what they are, and how they are used to power websites
Drupal: How to set up a simple website using it
Don't be put off by this list, however. With enough enthusiasm, you can learn what you need to while following this tutorial.;
, In order to develop a theme quickly and smoothly (without internet-connection-related issues), you should set up a developing environment (a code editor program and a testing server) on your computer. The most common way of doing this is to install a WAMP / LAMP / MAMP stack (W: windows; L: Linux; M: Mac, A: Apache, the server software; M: MySQL, the database software; P: PHP, the server-side script) and download an open-source code editor.

,

Drupal ‘template’ files (that have a file name ending in .tpl.php, meaning 'PHP template') are used by Drupal to structure the output of each web page.


Some of the commonly-used Drupal templates include: html.tpl.php, page.tpl.php, block.tpl.php, and node.tpl.php.
Each web page that Drupal outputs (the 'Home page' for example) will use the html template once, the page template once, and the region, block and node templates at least once each.
These templates files contain HTML, PHP, and printed variables within the PHP scripts. An example of a printed variable is <?php print render($content); ?> within the node.tpl.php file. This content variable stores all the text that the user typed into a basic page's 'Body' field when the user was logged into Drupal. The render() function simply makes sure the output of the content variable is wrapped in the appropriate HTML tags.
To see all the variables available in a template file, search for the default Drupal '.tpl.php' file on Drupal.org. If you'd like to see the typical content of one of these templates, you can look at the template files in the directory of the core Drupal themes in the drupal > themes folder (not the drupal > sites > all > themes folder).

,
These functions allow the themer to modify any of the variables available to the templates, so that they will display different output when they are printed in the template files. The difference between process and preprocess functions is simply that all preprocess functions are called (in a specific order set by Drupal) before all process functions; they are the same otherwise.


These functions are all written in the template.php file (note that this is not a '.tpl.php' file). The name of all preprocess and process functions you add you your theme will start with the name of your theme, eg. mytheme_process_node (). To add one to your theme, you can either write it from scratch, or copy it from another theme and modify it.
An example of using a preprocess function to change a variable is to append an opening and closing <section> tag to the start and end of the $variablesvariable within a 'mytheme_preprocess_node() function.

You can read more about process and preprocess functions, and see the order in which they're called, on the Drupal 7 theme function page on Drupal.org.

, The developers creating patches should generally run Drupal's code tests to make sure that their patch doesn't break any part of the Drupal code. You should see something like ""PHP 7 & MySQL 5.5, D8.2 39 pass"", indicating that the module still passed its tests with the new patch.

, The patch is basically a text file. You should download the file, and place it in the ""root directory"" of the module that the patch is for. For example, if its a patch for the Context module, you would place the patch file in ""sites/all/modules/context"".

, Open your terminal, and navigate to the module's root directory (as described in the previous step). If you have Git installed, you can use git's apply command: type in: ""git apply -v path/file.patch"". If you don't want to use Git, you can use the patch command: type in ""patch -p1 < path/file.patch""

, If you didn't see any error message when applying the patch, the bug should now be fixed. You should check that the issue no longer happens in your website.

, In the module's issue queue where you found the patch, you should help the community by adding a message to say that you had the issue and the patch fixed it.

, Same as above. Remember to create views that help the administrators / owners of the website manage their content, and put links to them into a menu such as the administration menu., Same as above.,, This will allow you to ensure that the distribution looks great and provides a good user experience out-the-box for its users. Focus on providing great templates for layout and structure, CSS for look-and-feel, and perhaps even some JavaScript for interactive elements., Inside your website's root directory, there will be a ""profiles"" directory that is probably empty (or it simply has a README file in it). Create a directory for your distribution, following Drupal's naming rules (all lowercase, underscores instead of spaces, etc.), This can easily be done from the admin interface (/admin/config/development/configuration), or using Drush or Drupal console. Once they've been created, copy all the files except core.extension.yml into the a new directory in your profile directory, such as /profiles//config/install/., If the distribution should have any themes and modules available when it is installed - they don't have to be enabled by default when it is installed - you can add them to the profile directory. Themes should go into a ""themes"" directory, and modules into a ""modules"" directory. Don't add any themes or modules that are already on Drupal.org into these folders; Drupal.org will take care of that for you (explained below)., This is very similar to the info files used by themes and modules., These are PHP files that can have functions you want to run, but are used at different times during the installation., This can be in text (.txt) or markdown (.md) format., This is a file that tells Drupal.org how to package or bundle your distribution with other projects (modules, themes, etc.). For instance, if you want the Pathauto module included as part of the distribution, it simply needs to be in the makefile. For Drupal 8 distributions, the makefile can be in either ""ini"" (older) or ""yaml"" (newer) format. While ""yaml"" is the recommended format, some developers have more difficulty getting Drupal.org to accept it without errors.

Creating it is easily done using drush. The following command will provide the code for this file: ""drush make-generate""

, Initialise the directory as a git repository, stage all the files, and commit them with a message., This will help other developers that use Github more frequently than Drupal.org support and improve your distribution., To test your distribution, all you need to do is run the install.php file with an empty database. If you want to use your existing database, make sure you make a backup (dump) of it first., Go to the Create account page and sign up to Drupal.org if you haven't already., Go to drupal.org/project/add, choose ""Distribution project"", and fill in the form that follows., When looking at your new project page, click on the ""Version control"" link at the top. That page provides instructions on how to push your project to the repository for it on Drupal.org. Keep in mind that if you've submitted your project to Github already and called that remote ""origin"", you'll need to name the Drupal.org remote something else, such as ""drupal.org""., When looking at your new project page (or if you're still on the Version Control page), click the ""Edit"" link at the top, then click on ""Releases"". If you committed your project correctly in the previous step, you'll see a ""Add new release"" link; click it. From the select field, choose your branch and continue. Fill in the ""Create Release"" form. When you've submitted that form, your distribution will be live and available for anyone to download! You might need to wait a few minutes before the release will show up on your project page, as Drupal.org tests and packages it for download., If the downloadable zip / tar files of your release are small (less than 1 MB), that means Drupal wasn't able to package it correctly, and there's likely an issue with your makefile. Check that your makefile is correct, then commit and push the project again. Wait a few minutes for Drupal to re-package it, and check that the download is now several MB.,"

Learn more about Simpletest.",How to Test Drupal Code," Make sure you're logged into your Drupal website as an administrator. Using the administrative menu, go to the 'Modules' page, find 'Simpletest', and click to enable it. It should already be installed with the Drupal core.
, In any Drupal website, all core modules and many contrib modules that are installed will already have many tests written for Simpletest. You can see all of them by going to 'Configuration' > 'Development' > 'Testing'. Looking through them should give you a better idea of what you can test and how you can label your tests.,, In your module folder, add a file named 'modulename.test'. This is a PHP file that you should add all your tests to. Then in your .info file, tell Drupal about the file using files[] = modulename.test.,




<?php
/**
 * @file
 * Description of file.
 */
 
class ModuleNameUnitTestsTestCase extends DrupalUnitTestCase {
 
  public static function getInfo() {
    // Note: getInfo() strings should not be translated.
    return array(
      'name' =>         'Functions tests',
      'description' =>  'Test that various functions work properly.',
      'group' =>        'Module Name',
    );
  }
 
}




, Imagine that you've written this function, and you'd like to test that it works properly:




function negate($int) {
  return $int * -1;
}




You could write a test (in your modulename.test file, after the getInfo() method) like this:




public function testNegates() {
  $result = negate(5);
}




, At the moment, the method in the previous step doesn't actually check the result of the test in any way. To make sure that the value is what we expect, we write an assertion. In this case, we'll add assertEqual() to our method to check that the result equals -5. Also, we'll add a message and group to our assertion, which will be helpful when we're running the test later.




public function testNegates() {
  $message = ""negate() should return a negative integer."";
  $group = ""Calculation"";
  $result = negate(5);
 
  $this->assertEqual($result, -5, $message, $group);
}




, In Drupal, go back to the Testing page. Among the list of tests, you should see the name of your module (if 'group' in your getInfo() method equals your module name). If you don't see it, you might need to flush the Drupal cache (specifically, the 'class' cache). Now enable your test using the checkbox, and select 'Run tests'. After a few seconds, you should see your test, and the result! It should be red if the test failed, and green if it succeeded., You can learn more about the available assertions on the DrupalTestCase page in the Drupal API."

To understand how and where views can best be used, it's valuable to be able to identify them in other great websites. In the screenshot above of the White House's website home page, multiple views can be seen, bordered in red rectangles.
Views come in many forms, such as lists of headlines or snippets, grid-style galleries, and picture slideshows or carousels.

To find them using code (such as by choosing to 'view source' of a webpage), you can look for '<div>' tags that contain the class 'block-views'.

, Log into your Drupal site, and select ‘Manage’ > ‘Structure’ > ‘Views’.;
,


Click the ‘Add new View button.
Fill in the view’s name; this is only used administratively (you’ll see this in the administration pages, but not on the actual website).
Add a description if the name of the view doesn’t clearly imply what it’s for or how it’s structured.
Under ‘View settings’, you can choose what kind of entities (and which kind of content if you choose a content entity) you’d like the view to display. This cannot be changed once you save the view. The entities that are displayed are called the results, just like search results.
Note that anything you choose or write on this ‘Add new view’ page (except the entity type) can be changed at any time after you save this view.

,
If the view will be displaying lots of information or content, it should have a page. If it won’t be displaying a lot of content, and you’d like to place it in a region (see managing Drupal blocks or building Drupal themes to learn about regions) on particular webpages, then choose a block. There are other view modes that can also be chosen after you save the view, such as an RSS feed., If you’d like the page or block title to be different from the view’s name, you can change it. Under ‘Page/Block display settings’, choose layout you’d like the results to have:


A grid is a large table, where each result has its own cell
An HTML list is a ‘unordered’ bullet-point list
A table displays each result as a row, and each field of each result in its own cell
An unformatted list is the simplest layout, with each result below the previous result.

, The ‘of’ selection box lets you choose the display format (such as full posts or teasers) you’d like to use, or specific fields. The display formats can be configured in the entities’ settings (such as on the ‘Structure’ > ‘Content types’ pages for content). Choose the fields option if you’d like to choose exactly which fields you’d like to display (such as ‘titles’, ‘creation date’, and many others), and each field’s settings., When you’ve saved the view, or when you edit an existing view, you’ll see a screen with the name of the view (and the type of entity that displays) at the top. The top half of this screen, titled ‘Displays’, is where you can change almost anything about the view. The bottom half is where a preview of the results will be shown, and will be updated as you change view settings.


In this results area, at the top, the area with the text ‘Preview with contextual filters: ’ and the textbox and the ‘Update preview’ button are only useful if you add contextual filters (explained below); if you view doesn’t use these, ignore this area.

, Under the ‘Displays’ title, you’ll see a button for each display type that your view has (blocks and pages). If you click the ‘Add’ button, you’ll see several new types of displays. Below this, you’ll see the name of the selected display type; you should rename the display if you have more than one of the same kind (for example, you have two blocks; one with a grid layout, the other with a table layout).
Below this, there are 3 columns (although the third one, ‘Advanced’, is minimized initially). The first column shows you settings you chose when you created the view and saved it. At the bottom are the FILTER and SORT CRITERIA. Filters allow you to restrict which entities will show in the results. For instance, by default for ‘content’ views, there will be a filter that only allows published content to show. Sort criteria are self-explanatory. Both filters and sorts can be ‘exposed to visitors’, which means that anyone viewing the page will be able to adjust the filter or sort criteria, which is particularly valuable for large views with lots of content. You’ll see these ‘exposed criteria’ just above the results (in the results preview area at the bottom of the page)., The first group of settings in the middle column is specific to the display type you’ve chosen. For instance, for pages, this is where the URL of the view can be changed. This is also where the setting to allow or deny particular users seeing the view (like permissions) is.

, Below the display type-specific settings, you can add a header and footer (or more than one of each) to the view. The commonly-used options are Global: Text area and Global: Result summary. The Result summary displays information about the results of the view, such as how many results are currently displayed. Other options are to add another entire view, or an entire entity (such as a page), into the header or footer.

, When a view isn’t configured correctly, or when there aren’t any of the expected entities to show, there won’t be any results. It’s helpful to both the visitor and you (administers) to know when this happens, in order to know the view is there, but isn’t working as expected (or there’s missing content). Adding a no-results behaviour is almost exactly the same as adding a header or footer, except that it shows up where the results would have been displayed., Relationships let us make links between entities, which gives us more fields to use in the view. More specifically, relationships provide access to data from entities that are related to the entities being displayed; this data can then be displayed, or used in other ways such as in filters.
For example, if your view displays articles (because you’ve got a filter for content: article), then you could add a relationship between the articles and the authors of the articles. This would allow you to use author information in the view; for example, you could display the first and last name of the author of each article displayed. Alternatively, you can use the relationship in filters; for example, you could choose to display only articles that were created by authors who have a specific role, such as administrators. We’ll use this example.
To do this, click the ‘Add’ button next to ‘RELATIONSHIPS’, and choose ‘Content: Content author’ from the list of available relationships (hint: you could use the search box if you know which relationship you want to add), and click the Apply button. Next, you can check the options, then ‘Apply’ the relationship.
To use this relationship in an ordinary filter, click the FILTERS’ ‘Add’ button. In the ‘Add filter criteria’ dialog box, in the ‘Type’ selection box, there will now be a new ‘User’ option (put there because of the relationship), which you should select to narrow down the list of fields. Find and apply the ‘User: roles’ field. In the ‘Configure filter criterion: User: Roles’ dialog box, select ‘author’ from the relationship box (it should be selected by default). Now you can choose ‘administrator’ and apply the filter.
You’ve just filtered the articles that will be displayed to only show articles that are by administer authors! What’s particularly important to note is that you had to choose to ‘use the relationship’ in the filter screen, which made the filter look at the authors of the articles (that’s what the relationship means)!"

Think of the HTML structure as three sections.,
Understand how CSS factors in.,
Do this with the help of classes and ids, if desired.,
Access the DOM (Data object Model) elements, or the HTML elements, by their tag names.,
Access specific elements by their tag name as well.,
Give yourself time to learn.,
Learn to break your webpage design structure correctly.,
Know that the CSS Box Model is very important.,
Learn floats and their uses.",How to Use HTML and CSS,"

The Head tag is the first section. It contains all data relevant to the web page's purpose and information. This includes meta data, title, external file sources, etc. Several websites also contain important information pertaining to the website traffic analytics, page rank, etc. All of these are contained within this segment.



 


Next comes the Body tag. This is the main centre for the webpage structure. The website's wireframe or building blocks are mentioned here. You actually mention elements and tags here in this space. According to the order in which you mention, the elements get placed in the final webpage.






So, for example, if we write a form tag and then an image tag; we would find our webpage displaying a form and below that an image (but of course these orders and positions can be altered with high grade CSS).So, if you have a design in hand, just keep on adding elements according to your design flow. The different segments (left, right , center) of a webpage must be treated accordingly. For that we have the table tag or list tags. Learn all the types of tags available in HTML and understand their implementation.


Finally comes the Foot section. This section normally contains all that is visible in the webpage footer area. However, we do not normally include this separately. Instead, the footer contents are appended to the body itself





;
, CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, were introduced by the W3C in order to reduce HTML file size, get a cleaner code and synchronize styles separately with HTML. These are nothing but separate files that are included in the HTML head section, and they contain the style definition for the various elements of the HTML document.


CSS defined style codes include font behaviour, color, height, width, display style, etc. They also include behavioural definition for mouseover and mouse-out events. In fact, with the latest inclusion of CSS3, styling has been enhanced to a very different level. Now, you can create animations, transformations and transitions - all from the CSS codes. Mostly we use CSS to declare width, height, color, font, etc. These are the most common styling options, and help us define the appearance and position of the several HTML elements.

, This is the most common procedure and is followed as a master stroke all around the internet world. In your HTML document, while declaring an element, just add the attribute ""class"" and assign a certain name to it. The same for ""id"". Now in your CSS file, just write the class name or id name and define your style. Automatically that particular element will derive the style definitions.


While declaring with class name, in the CSS file, add a dot in front. For ids, add a hash in front of the name. That is the syntax. Now, the most important part.
So, what is the difference between classes and ids? They can't be same if they co-exist. Yes, there is a huge difference. In your HTML document, you can name as many elements you want with the same class name. But ids must be dedicated to one single element. Therefore, classes are used when we need the same style for multiple items on the HTML page, and ids for styling one single item exclusively.

, So, if we want to remove borders from all image tags in the page; we just write 'img' and declare 'border : none'. This will however be applicable to all image tags on the document. You may be thinking, is there a way we can point to a specific element (an image tag for example) but with its element name ? Yes there is a way. Dive into the next point.

, You need to however traverse all through their parent elements up to them. That was a bit tough was it? Okay. Let's take an example. Suppose we have a form element and then an input element inside it. We also have input elements outside of the form, just stray ones for example. So, now if we follow the point above and declare some styling on input elements; these styles shall be implemented on both input elements inside and outside of the form. I


f we want the style to be implemented only on the element inside the form, we can do this - form input { /* Declare the style here */ }. So, notice how we accessed the input element we want to style specifically. First the parent and then the main element. In this way, the outer input elements get discarded.

, To be a veteran in coding can take quite a lot of time. But here are some topics that can help you understand the basic methodologies and design standard HTML pages quickly.

, Understand your available tags and find out how you can use them to break down your page into the simplest structure.

, Understanding width, height of an element is the first step. But after that, you must learn how to adjust spacing with the help of padding and margin. There are certain cases where margins are not applicable. You must use padding therefore, and vice versa. Try to find out what exactly they are and how they are used.

, The CSS float is another very important aspect of styling. Floating content left and right plays an important role in website structure.

Start by typing out a message, as you normally would.,
Move on to non-text BBCode, such as this:

Use: Displays an image from the site you are linking to.",How to Use BBCode," After you're done, you can go back and add the following ""codes"" to your text for effects. All codes must, must, must be followed with a closing tag to end their effect. For example, ""Hello"" would have the code cut off at the H, leaving the rest without bold.

Example: Bold Use: Bold text for emphasis.



 


Example: Italics Use: Italicizes text for emphasis or titles.






Example: Underline Use: Underlines text for titles, generally.






Example: Strikethrough Use: Puts a single line through the text, generally used to suggest that something is no longer applicable.






. Example: Colored Text Use: Adds color to your text.






In the citations, there are links which have lists of colors.


Example: None. Use: Makes text's size adjustable.






""Text here""Example: None. Use: Allows the posting of code without it triggering, generally.;

Understand the anatomy of a CSS Style.,
Create a style sheet with styles for each element of the page you would like to style.

,
Use declarations.,
Some common declarations are:


color: changes the font color like this.,
Note that these are only very simple declarations.,
Create style sheets.,
Be aware that many people recommend that you use external style sheets.,
To link to an external style sheet, add <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""mycsssheet.css"" />.,
To create an internal style sheet, include <style type=""text/css"">Styles Here</script>.,
CSS is a powerful tool for positioning elements on the screen.,
Note that while this is a very basic change, it can be coupled with more CSS and HTML to create a beautiful two column layout.

,
A completed internal CSS style sheet along with a HTML document would look like this:

,
This style sheet creates a margin of 15 pixels to the left of all paragraphs.",How to Style a Page Using CSS," CSS is a simple and straightforward language. A CSS style is made up of three key parts. Take this CSS code snippet: p {color: red; font-size: 2em;}. This style makes all paragraph's(data enclosed in <p> tags) red and increases the font size. The three parts are called the selector, the declaration block, and the declarations.


The selector in our example is the p before the opening brace. A selector defines which part of the HTML will receive the style(in this case HTML paragraphs).
The declaration block in our example is everything from the opening brace to the closing brace. The declaration block is made up of declarations for that style. A style will have only one declaration block.
Our example actually has two declarations. They are color: red; and font-size: 2em;. Declarations tell what you want to do with the element defined in the selector of the style. You can have as many declarations as you want in a style.

,, In a CSS style, declarations are what defines what part of the element you want to style and how it should appear. For example to turn this text red the declaration is color: red; (this example actually uses the HTML font tag because wikiHow's editor doesn't support some of the CSS needed). Make sure you end declarations with a semicolon.

, Possible values: blue, red, or a hex code.
font-weight: changes font to bold, italics, etc. Possible values: bold, italic.
text-align: aligns text. Possible values: right, left, center.
border: changes or creates a border around the selected element. A possible value could be border: 1px solid red. This creates a border 1 pixel in size that is solid and red in color.
margin: this creates a margin around the selected element. A possible value is margin-left: 5px. This creates adds five pixels of empty space to the top of the element.
background-color: changes the background. Possible values: red, black, and hex code.;
, Many sites use more complex declarations for positioning among other things.

, Style Sheets consist of many styles all together. There are three types of style sheets:


External style sheets are text files saved with the .css extension. They are linked to an HTML document using the <link> tag.
Internal style sheets are styles defined in the <script> tag. They are created in the HTML document.
Inline styles are styles declared in the tag they apply to. For example <p style=""color: red""> is an inline style declared in the tag it applies to.

, While this is a good practice it is easier to use internal style sheets when you are learning CSS. It is not recommended that you use inline styles.

, This tag is used in the head of the document. After you link to a style sheet it is in use throughout the entire page. The href attribute defines the file location and name of your style sheet. All external style sheets must be save with the .css extension and created in na text editor such as Notepad.

, All styles go in between the two script tags. For example here is a simple page that uses internal styles to turn all paragraphs green.

, It can use styles and the div tag to create sidebars and multi-column layouts. For example this page has no CSS.,,, Then it adds a 5 pixel border to the left of the paragraphs. Finally it turns them dark blue. All together this page would look like this:"
"
Open Notepad and type down the basic HTML structure.,
Put the <div> tag inside the body tags.,
In the <style>, give the <div> an ID and set its height, width, background-color, etc.,
Put the <span> tag and write some text and then close it with </span>.,
Give you span an ID and set its properties.,
Don't forget to enjoy!",How to Use DIV and Span in HTML and CSS," It basically contains body inside HTML.;
, You must remember that div is a container tag so it must have a </div> after it, like <div> </div>


<div> is used to make divisions on the page, so you can even use div tags inside a <div>.


,


You can use # for making an ID for your <div> or just simply write div and set its height, width, etc. But when you have many divs, its better to use an ID.

, The span tag is generally used to select a part of line and apply some properties to it. However you can use it for selecting more than a single line.

, You can have multiple spans in a line.

Create a link in your HTML file.,
Connect your HTML file to your CSS file.,
Edit your HTML code with your CSS file.,
You can edit the link's style how you want.",How to Style a Link with CSS," Do that by writing <a href=""http:Some text here</a>. Some text here will appear blue and underlined, and when you click it it will bring you to the website www.example.com (just so you know, this is an example website).;
, Do this by typing <link type=""txt/css"" rel=""stylesheet"" href=""stylesheet.css""> after the <head> tags. Your CSS file must be named stylesheet.css for this to work.

, Find a style sheet on the internet and copy it into a file on your computer. Try changing, taking away, or adding code. Save and refresh the page on your browser and see what it looks like. Only change one thing at a time so you can understand what you just did. You can also look at other web pages using the view drop down button(which is located on most browsers), then select page source. For AOL users, right click the page where links and pictures are not located and select source view.


Don't expect yourself to understand all the lines of code written when you're experimenting the source code of any site.

, Think about how you want it to look and try to use CSS to make your website look that way. If you can't figure out how to get it to look the way you want, look it up.


Use multiple windows to check the output of your code every once in a while so that it'd be easier to understand.

You can write HTML with most text editing software, but more complex software with automatic formatting can make it harder to organize your HTML page.TextEdit is not recommended, as it will often save the file in a format your browser may not recognize as HTML.
You can also use an online HTML editor. Specialized HTML editing programs are not recommended for beginners., Select File → Save As in the top menu. Change the file format to ""Web Page,"" "".html"" or "".htm"". Save it in a location where you can easily find the file.


There is no difference between these three options.

, Double click the file, and it should automatically open as a blank web page in your browser. Alternatively, you can open a browser, such as Firefox or Internet Explorer, and use File → Open File to select the document.


This web page is not online. It can only be viewed on your computer.

, Type this into your blank document: <strong>Hello</strong>. Save the document. Refresh the blank web page in your browser, and you should see the word ""Hello"" appear at the top of the page in bold. Anytime you want to test your new HTML during this tutorial, save the .html document, then refresh your browser window to see how the HTML is interpreted.


If you see the words ""<strong>"" and ""</strong>'' appear in your browser, your file isn't being properly interpreted as HTML. Try a different text editing program or a different browser.

, HTML instructions are written in ""tags"" that tell the browser how to interpret and display your web page. They are always written between angle brackets <like these>, and are not displayed on the web page. You've already used them in the example above:


<strong> is a ""start tag"" or ""opening tag"". Anything written after this tag will be defined as ""strong text"" (usually indicated in bold on a web page).
</strong> is an ""end tag"" or ""closing tag,"" which you can identify from the / symbol. This shows where the strong text stops. Most tags (though not all) need an end tag to function, so remember to include it.

, Delete everything in your HTML document. Begin again with the following text, exactly as written (ignoring the bullet points). This HTML code tells the browser what type of HTML you'll be using, and that all your HTML will be contained within the <html> and </html> tags.<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-
<html>
</html>

, HTML documents are divided into two sections. The ""head"" section is for special information, like the title of the page. The ""body"" section includes the main content of the page. Add these both to your document, remembering to include end tags. The new text to add is in bold:


<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

, Most tags that go in the head section are not important to learn as a beginner. The title tag is easy to use, though, and will determine what shows up as the name of your browser window or on the browser tab. Put the title start and end tags inside the head tags, and write any title you like between them:


<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-
<html>
<head>
<title>My first HTML page.</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

, For this section, we'll be working only within the body tags. The other text will still be there in your document, but we'll save some space by not repeating it every time in this guide. Write anything you like between the <body> and </body> tags, and it will appear as the first content on your web page. For example:


<body>
I'm following the wikiHow guide to write an HTML page.
</body>

, Organize your page with header tags, which instruct the browser to display text between them in a larger size. These are also used by search engine bots and other tools to determine what your page is about and how it is organized. <h1> </h1> is the largest header, and you can create smaller headers all the way down to <h6> </h6>. Try them out on your page:


<body>
<h1>Welcome to My Web Page.</h1>
I'm following the wikiHow guide to write an HTML page.
<h3>My goals today:</h3>
<h5>Completed goals:</h5>
Learn how to use headers.
<h5>Uncompleted goals:</h5>
Learn more text formatting tags.
</body>

, You've already seen the ""strong"" tag, but there are many more ways to format your text. Play around with these, or with multiple tags around the same string of text. Always remember to add the end tag afterward!



<strong>Important text, displayed as bold in browsers.</strong>


<em>Emphasized text, displayed as italics in browsers.</em>


<small>Slightly smaller text than usual. This automatically scales if used in a heading.</small>


<del>Text that is no longer applicable, displayed with a strike-through line.</del>


<ins>Text that has been inserted later than the rest, displayed as an underline.</ins>


, You might have noticed that hitting the ""enter"" key isn't enough to get your text to display on a different line. These tags can help you form paragraphs and line breaks, or arrange your text in other ways:



<p> Short for ""paragraph,"" this will keep all text between these tags in one paragraph, and separate it out from text above and below it.</p>


<br> This will create a line break. Do not include an end tag for this, since it's not altering any other content. Use this for poems or address lines, not to separate paragraphs.<pre>If you need to display text very precisely, this tag will set the text inside to a fixed-width font (each letter exactly the same width), and let you create spaces and line breaks as you would for normal typing instead of with tags.</pre>


<blockquote>This defines text that has been quoted from a source.</blockquote> You can describe the source afterward with the <cite>cite tag</cite>.

, Comment tags are not visible on the web page. They allow you to write notes to yourself in the HTML document, without interfering with the content. <!--- Write your comment inside the tag. ---> Do not add an end tag.


Tags that stand by themselves and do not use end tags are called ""empty tags.""

, The best way to remember these tags is to use them in your own web page. Here's an example using tags from each of the steps you've learned so far. Try to predict what it would look like in a browser, than copy-paste it to your document and find out.


<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-
<html>
<head>
<title>My first HTML page.</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to My Web Page.</h1>
I hope you enjoy the site!<p><strong>I made it just for you.</strong>
<h2>Part One: How I Discovered HTML</h2>
<!---Note to self: remember that ""h1"" is a larger header than ""h2""--->
I've been learning HTML for <del>one</del> <ins>two</ins>hours now, so I'm an expert.
</body>
</html>

, Tags can have extra information written inside them, called ""attributes."" These show up as extra words within the tag itself, in the form of attribute-name=""specific value"". For example, just about any HTML tag can have the title attribute:


<p title=""Introduction"">Introductory paragraph goes here.</p> gives the paragraph a title, ""Introduction,"" which appears when you mouse over the paragraph in the web page.

, Use the <a> </a> tag to create a hyperlink to any other web page. Insert the URL of the web page to link to using the href attribute. Here's an example that links to the page you're reading now:


<a href=""https:Visitors to your website can click this text to follow the link.</a>

, Another attribute that just about any HTML tag can use is the ""id"" element. Inside any tag, write id=""example"" or use any name that does not include spaces.This won't have any visible effect, but we'll use it in the next step.


For example, add this to your document: <p id=""example"">This paragraph will be used as an example to show how the id attribute works.</p>

, Now we can use the hyperlink tag, <a> </a>, to link to another spot on the same page. Instead of a URL, we'll use the # symbol, followed by the id value we're linking to. For example, <a href=""#example"">This text will link to the paragraph with the id ""example.""</a>


All HTML values are case-insensitive.""#EXAMPLE"" and ""#example"" will link to the same place.
If your page is short enough to display all at once, you might not notice anything happen when you click the link in your browser. Resize the window until a scroll bar appears, then try again.

, The <img> tag is an empty tag, meaning no closing tag is necessary. All the information the browser needs to display the image will be added using attributes.Here's an example that will display the wikiHow logo, followed by a description of each attribute:


<img src=""http:
The src="" "" attribute tells the browser where to find the image. (Note that it's generally considered rude to display an image from someone else's site – and the image will disappear if that site ever goes offline.)
The style="" "" attribute can do many things, but most importantly it's used to set the width and height of the image in pixels. (You can instead use the separate width="" "" and height="" "" attributes, but this can lead to weird resizing problems if you are using CSS.)
The alt="" "" attribute is a brief description of the image, which the user will see if the image fails to load. This is considered a requirement, since it's used by screen readers for blind visitors., HTML validation checks for errors in your code. If your web page isn't displaying correctly, validation can help you find the mistake causing problems. It can also teach you more about HTML, by identifying code that looks fine on your display, but isn't recommended due to updates in the HTML standard. Using invalid HTML doesn't make your site unusable, but it can cause problems or inconsistent display in different browsers.


Try a free online validation service from W3C or search for another HTML 5 validator online.

, There are many more HTML tags and attributes, and many places to learn them:


Try w3schools and HTML Dog for more tutorials and comprehensive lists of tags.
Find a web page you like the look of, and use your browser's ""View Page Source"" function to see the HTML for yourself. Copy-paste it into your own document and play with it to see how it works.
Read other articles to learn about making HTML tables, using meta tags to boost your search engine visibility, or using div and span to help with css styling.

, Choose a web hosting service, and you can upload as many HTML pages as you like to your personal web domain. To do this, you'll need to use FTP uploading software, but many web hosts provide this service as well.


When linking to pages or images on your own site, you do not need to use the full address. For example, if your domain name is www.superskilledhtmlcoder.com, then <a href=""/journal/monday.html"">the text inside these tags</a> will link to the address ""www.superskilledhtmlcoder.com/journal/monday.html""

, If your HTML page is looking a little bare-bones, try learning some basic CSS to add color, different fonts, and greater control over element placement. Linking a CSS ""stylesheet"" to the HTML page lets you make powerful changes quickly, automatically adjusting the style of all text within a certain tag. You can play around with a basic stylesheet here, or delve into a more detailed tutorial at HTML Dog's CSS guide.

, JavaScript is a programming language used to add more function to your HTML pages. JavaScript commands are inserted between the start and end tags <script> </script>, and can be used to add interactive buttons, calculate math problems, and much more.

"
Structure your HTML properly for optimal CSS performance.,
Find the name of the column id in your CSS (like ""#sidebar"").

,
Decide whether you want the column to appear to the right or the left.

,
Add ""float: right;"" or ""float: left;"" to the CSS for the id name (like ""#sidebar { float: right; }"").",How to Format Columns in CSS1," You want 2 ""id""s surrounding each column, to avoid layout issues.


Name the first id with the column purpose, like ""sidebar"". You will put all CSS for the column content here.
Name the second id with the column purpose plus ""wrapper"", like ""sidebar-wrapper"". You will put all CSS for column layout here. This id will surround the other id. (So in your HTML, you'll have something like div id='sidebar-wrapper' inside < > immediately followed by div id='sidebar' (again in < >) followed by CONTENT and /div inside < > (repeated twice).

,,,


If you want more than 2 columns, you'll need to start off with a 2-column structure, then break those columns further. For example, if you want 3 columns, you'll start with a main column and a side column then put 2 columns within the main column, with one floating right and one floating left.

",How to Do Absolute Positioning With CSS," This is written as position: absolute;;
, This may be from the top, bottom, left, or right side of the screen. For example, to position an element along the right side of the screen, use the right property.

, For example, to position an element 5 pixels from the right side of the screen, add right: 5 px; to an element's style or to a class or ID in a CSS style sheet.

;
,
The first <html> tag tells the browser that this is the start of the HTML document.,
Tags


HTML documents consist of tags.,
The tags for an ordered list are similar, but the opening and closing tag are <ol> and </ol>
Code such as this...
<ul><li>One<li>Two<li>Three</ul><br>
is rendered by the browser like this...
One
Two
Three


Note that these are only the very basic HTML tags.,
DOCTYPE


A DOCTYPE declaration is a statement at the very beginning of the document (before the <html> tag) that tells a browser what version of HTML to expect.,
Most pages will work fine without a Doctype but it is a good idea to have one.,
The Encapsulation Rule


All (X)HTML(referring to both XHTML and HTML) tags must be closed.,
The Head


The head of the document(information between the <head> and </head> tags) is not viewable by the visitor of the page(except the title).,
Comments


HTML comments, <!---...--->, are bits of information we put into the code for developer uses.,
Informational Structure and Styling


Michio Kaku once said that our most advanced computer has the intelligence of a retarded cockroach.",How to Write a Simple Page in HTML,", The data in between <head> and </head> does not appear on the page. It contains metadata and titles that help search engines fine your page. The data in between the <body> and </body> tags appears on the page.

, Tags are what tells the web browser how to display the code. Tags consist on and opening bracket and a closing bracket: <____>. Many tags come in pairs meaning that there is an opening tag followed by a closing tag:<____>Tag Data</____>. Note that the closing tag has a slash after the opening bracket. Examples of tags include:
<a href="""">Link Text</a> - This tag creates a link.

The href attribute determines the URL for the link to go. For example: <a href=""https:Wikihow</a> creates a link that says Wikihow and links to wikiHow.com like this: Wikihow.


<h1>Your Header Here</h1> - This tag creates a header or an introduction to the following paragraph. HTML supports 5 different levels of headers, h1, h2, h3, h4, and h5. h1 is the biggest and boldest, h5 is the least. Headers are used to break up a page into ""concept blocks"". Examples may beMy first level header
My second level header

<p>Text Here</p> - This tag creates a paragraph. It's always a good idea to divide a webpage into multiple paragraphs for readability.
<img src="""" /> - Adds an image to a webpage.

The src attribute tells the location of the image. This is one of the tags without a closing tag.


<strong>Text Here</strong> - Puts emphasis on the text like this.

There are two types of lists; an ordered (numbered) and an un-ordered list (bullet points). The tags for an unordered list start by declaring it is an unordered list <ul> and then have an entry for each list item <li>. Repeat this tag as needed for each item in the list. The list ends with a closing tag </ul>

, There are a lot more. A good resource on all things HTML(as well as CSS, JavaScript, etc.) is W3schools.com.

, A common DOCTYPE is:<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-
.

,


Differences in versions of HTML over the years has led to some tags being put out of use. A DOCTYPE will tell the browser whether or not it can use said tags.

The commonly used <b> and <i> tags have been put out of use as of XHTML version 2.0 and HTML versions past 3. They are replaced by the <strong> and <em> tags. The W3C is deprecating(putting tags targeted towards text formatting out of use).



, Below is a valid XHTML document.<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-""http:
<html xmlns=""http:
<head>
<meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html;charset=utf-8""/>
<title>Hello World!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>

This is an example of the Hello World test. Every programming language has a version of it.

, Information in the <head> can be made up of many tags:

META - used to specify information for search engines such as keywords or descriptions.
LINK - used to link to other documents like CSS stylesheets of JavaScript files.
STYLE - an internal CSS stylesheet coded in between these tags.
TITLE - the title that appears on the top of a browser.


Example:<head>
<title>...</title>
<meta name=""keywords"" content=""..."" />
<script type=""text/javascript"">...</script>
<style type=""text/css"">...</style>
</head>


, The computer ignores text between the two tags. It is recommended that you include comments in your code in case you come back to change something and not know what it means.

, The computer running your HTML does not understand the informational structure of your document. For example, say you were writing a webpage on zoo animals. You want to highlight all text in the section about lions. The computer does not know what section that is. You have to tell it. You tell it by using <div> tags. Basically these tags define sections of the text. Most websites out there are styled using these tags. You can name these tags using the id attribute.

,How to Use Font Color Tags in HTML1,
"
Find the name of the column wrapper id in your CSS (like ""#sidebar-wrapper"").,
Determine how wide you want the column to be.,
Add that ""width"" to the column wrapper id (like ""sidebar-wrapper { width: 30%; }"").

,
Determine your desired column ""height"" and add that to the column wrapper id (like ""sidebar-wrapper { height: 100%; }.

",How to Format Columns in CSS2,";
, You can set this in percentages or pixels.

,,"
"
Determine what size padding, margins, and borders you want on either side of the column.,
Add the padding and margins to the column name id (like ""#sidebar { padding: 0 5px; margin: 0 5px; border: 2px dotted #fff; }"", which gives the column 5 pixels of margin and padding on either side, but none on the top and bottom).

,
Add your desired colors to the column name id.,
Pick which HTML tags you want to give special appearances and write their CSS that refers to the tags that are specifically within the column name id.,
Choose any font changes you want in that particular column, and put that code in the column name id (like #sidebar { font-size: 0.8em; }.

,
Enjoy knowing how to format columns in CSS.

",How to Format Columns in CSS3,"


Padding is space between the edge of your column background and the text.
Margin is the space after the edge of the background before the next column begins.

,, For example, for a black background on white text, you would use ""#sidebar { background-color #000; color #fff; }"".

, For example, to turn all ""h3"" tagged text red in your sidebar, you would write ""#sidebar h3 { color #f00; }"".

,,"
"
Create the font tag.,
Add the color attribute.,
Choose a color name.,
Use a hex color code instead.,
Play with RGB values.,
Understand the hex color code in depth.",How to Use Font Color Tags in HTML2," Place a <font> tag in front of the text you'd like in color. Close it with a </font> tag after the text.


Example:
<font>I plan to make this text blue.</font>

, Insert color="" "" inside the opening font tag. The color you want will go inside the quotation marks.


Example:
<font>color="" ""I plan to make this text blue.</font>

, Color names are always one word, with no spaces. Try a simple name like ""blue"" or ""red"", or a descriptive name like ""lightblue"" or ""darkblue"". For more options, look up the list of recognized color keywords, which includes ""maroon"", ""steelblue"", and ""lime"".Example:
<font color=""blue"">I plan to make this text blue.</font>

, HTML allows you to choose from millions of colors, but it doesn't have a name for every one. Instead, it uses a six-digit code written in a number system called hexadecimal. There are many websites that list hex color codes, or that let you pick a color on screen and tells you the hex value. The code begins with the symbol # and has six digits using the numbers 0-9 or the letters A-F.


<font color=""FF0000"">The code #FF0000 is the same as the color name red.</font>
<font color=""00FF00"">This code produces green text.</font>
<font color=""0000FF"">This code makes blue text.</font>

, You don't need to know how hex color codes work to use an online color picker. If you'd like to experiment, however, start with the basics:


Each six digit code is divided into red, green, and blue values (""RGB""). For example, the code #FF0000 really means ""red: FF green: 00 blue: 00.""
To change the amount of red, change the first two digits. You can use anything from 00 (no red at all) to 99 (some red) or the letters AA (a little more red) through FF (maximum red).
Use the same system to change the green value (middle two digits) or blue value (last two digits).

, For more precise color selection, you'll need to know two more concepts:


Each of the three color values is a two digit number. To make small adjustments, just change the second digit. For example, #850000 and #890000 are very similar, but #A50000 is much brighter.
The RGB values combine using the additive color system. Red and green make yellow; blue and green make cyan; and red and blue make magenta."
"
Insert the style attribute into an HTML tag.,
Specify the color.,
Use CSS classes for styles you use often.",How to Use Font Color Tags in HTML3," The attribute style="" "" allows you to use CSS inside an HML document. This is an easy way to set font color even if you don't know CSS. Try putting the style attribute inside one of these HTML tags:


<p style="" "">The p tag surrounds a whole paragraph of text.</p>
<a style="" "" href=""https://www.wikihow.com"">The a tag surrounds a link.</a>
<span style="" "">Use the span tag if you want to color part of a paragraph without changing the formatting.</span>

, Insert color: followed by a color name or hex code inside the quotation marks.For detailed information on color names and codes, see the method above or try these examples:


<span style=""color:red"">This makes red text.</span>
<span style=""color:#556B2F"">This is the color code for dark olive green.</span>
<span style=""color:#745"">CSS supports shortened 3-digit color codes. The code 745 is short for 774455.</span>

, If you want to style every photo caption or chapter title on a large web page, you don't need to type in the full code every time. Instead, define a CSS class in the head of the document, so you can refer to it with a shorthand every time you want to use that style.Here's an example which demonstrates a couple new uses of the style attribute:


In the <head>section of your HTML document, paste the following code:
<style type=""text/css"">
.fancy {
font-family: Cursive;
color: darkgreen;
font-size:150%;
}
</style>
In the body of the same document, use the attribute class=""fancy"" to add this style to an element. For example <p class=""fancy"">this paragraph</p> would show up as dark green, large text in cursive font.
Note that you can use any word instead of ""fancy"" to describe a style.

First, some information about HTML:
To program in HTML we use ""tags"".,
Open a new notepad document.

,Type
<html>
<body>

</body>
</html>

,
Save the document with any name you like but with the extension: .html, like this: website.html
if you don't save it like this is not going to work!

,
Go to the folder where you save the document, there you will find the document with the IExplorer symbol.

,
Open it and it's going to look like this:

,
Experiment with new tags.,

BOLD: < b > hello < /b > ----> hello








ITALIC: < i > hello < /i > ----> hello








UNDERLINE: < u > hello < /u > ----> hello








FONT COLOR: < font color=""f11a0a"" > hello < /font > ----> hello








SPACE BETWEEN LINES (enter): hello < br > how are u?",How to Use Simple HTML Format," They are the ones that give format to the text that is going to appear in your website, make tables, insert images, etc.
A tag goes between this symbols ""< >"", like this <xxx>.
Everything else that is not between ""< >"" is what is going to appear in the website.
There are two kinds of tags: open and close.
Open tags have just one key word, for example: <xxx> .
Close tags (the most common ones) have two key words, the last one goes at the end of the sentence you want appear in the website and have the symbol ""/"", for example:
<yyy> hi, my name is Dane </yyy>.


,,,,,, here's a list of the most common tags:
, ----> hello
how are u?

Learn HTML(4).,
Know about the new tags.,
Start using the placeholder attribute.<input placeholder=""this is a text box"" type=""text"">
This provides a placeholder for your box-the text that is displayed until the user clicks on it.,

Decide whether the blog is for personal or general viewing.,
Browse other pregnancy blogs and take note of the features you like best.,
Choose a blog host or platform.,
Take time to learn how to use the blog management tools well.,
Make a personal commitment regarding the number and type of posts you plan to publish each week.,
Let family and friends know about the blog.,
Use photos, links, videos, and other multimedia.,
Avoid long narratives, cuss words, and messy details.,
Follow other pregnancy blogs and let them know about your blog.",How to Maintain a Successful Pregnancy Blog," This will determine whether you make the blog public and searchable by engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing.


If you choose to keep the blog for friends and family only, you may decide to password protect it. This way, you can post more personal information or private details without the whole world having access to it.;
, Take the time to look at other pregnancy blogs and write down what most appeals to you. These are the things you may want to incorporate into your own blog.


Look at the writing style, the length and content of posts, the use of images and videos, the links to other websites and blogs.
Consider the type of work that attracts followers and comments, if that is something you’re interested in incorporating into your blog.
Pay attention to the various presentation styles (templates) that pregnancy blogs you like have used. This includes noting the colors, layouts, fonts, and any added features called widgets.
Note the use of titles and tags. Titles are very useful messages for readers, clarifying what each post will be about. Choosing appealing or attention-grabbing titles for your posts could increase your traffic and make you more visible in search results. Tags, on the other hand, are not always visible (that is something you can choose as you design your blog) but they can help searchers find topics that address the information they’re looking for. All of this will give you a good feel for what you like and don’t like, what you do or do not want to emulate, and what appears to be popular with readers.

,


Sites like Wordpress.com, LiveJournal.com, and Blogger.com offer free blogging platforms to registered account holders. Because they're free, they are also limited in the styles and flexibility of the page set-up, but there are still many options and designs to choose from.
For most bloggers who will mainly be using their blog to keep friends and family up to date on the pregnancy and birth, a free site may be a more manageable option.
If you decide to pay for extra features and flexibility, be sure you know how to create content by applying at least the basics in web design.

, When you first launch your blog, you don’t want to spend an hour on each post trying to figure out how to insert a hyperlink, appropriately use tags, get a widget added, or add a picture.


Reading the set-up instructions and how-to guides posted by most blog servers can save a lot of time and frustration. Knowing these skills upfront will also help your blog look polished and modern from day one.

,


Avoid overly ambitious goals of posting every day until you gain some experience blogging.
Most active blogs average a few posts a week. For pregnancy bloggers, this number of posts will typically allow for you to share the highlights of your best and worst moments of each week. Other excellent blogs have just one post per week.
If your pregnancy blog is geared toward a larger audience, try mixing up the style of posts so that each week has a personal reflection piece, a link to a newsworthy story or event, a picture or video related post, and other variations in the content to keep readers coming to the site as well as to bring in new traffic.
If your blog is for a more personal purpose, one solid post per week may be enough to keep your viewers satisfied. Variation is also a good tip for personal pregnancy blogs so that readers don’t feel like each week is more of the same, however.

, Publicize and advertise your efforts so that the people you care about or your target audience are aware of your efforts and know how to access your blog.


If you have a presence on Facebook, MySpace, or a profile on another social networking site, post an announcement of your new blog and send out reminders or updates occasionally to let them know about new posts or topics.
Also spread the word via email, quick notes, texts, or phone calls to just let people know what you are trying to do and how they can support your efforts or stay informed about your pregnancy.

, It is hard to overemphasize how important graphics and linked material are to the success of a pregnancy blog.


Not only can photos and videos add visual interest to your blog, they can also help attract new readers, generate conversation, and get your blog noticed.
Try posting monthly pictures of your growing belly to track your tummy size. Put up the ultrasound to share your baby’s development.
Upload YouTube videos that talk about pregnancy issues (in concise and entertaining ways, of course!), and take advantage of free digital photos and artwork that detail the growth of a baby by trimester or the importance of a healthy diet (just be sure to cite the credit for the free photos).

, Blogs with long, in-depth narratives can deter casual readers or make even friends and family feel that the blog is too time consuming to follow. Keep posts relatively brief except in special circumstances, and break long paragraphs into short groups of one to three sentences. Large blocks of text are unappealing to many readers, and are visually more daunting than short, manageable bits.


Avoid cuss words and vulgar language as a general rule. On some blog venues, lewd or adult language can be flagged and removed by the site provider, and other users can file complaints lobbying to have your blog shut down until the language is changed or removed. Furthermore, sites with inappropriate language can turn off many casual readers and keep your blog from being nominated for higher visibility on sites like Wordpress.com. It's fine to be funny about your pregnancy; just try to do this without being offensive.
Messy details are a fact of pregnancy. Just be sure that your funny story about peeing a bit when you sneeze doesn’t cross the line to detailed descriptions of the messy and often unattractive side of pregnancy unless you have a very targeted audience that will empathize with your stories. If your blog’s audience includes your male coworkers or neighborhood acquaintances, be sure you’ll be comfortable seeing them in person after publishing personal content on your pregnancy blog.

, If you are blogging for the general public in addition to your family and friends, be sure to get involved in the pregnancy blog community.


Read other pregnancy blogs and make thoughtful comments, link to them in your stories and blogroll, talk with the other bloggers about their blogs and your new blog, and politely and casually spread the word about your blog to them. Becoming a member of the network of pregnancy bloggers can help generate interest in your blog and can bring you new traffic. However, be sure not to push your blog without also contributing to theirs, as this is how blogging works––you give as much as you get.
Keeping tabs on what others are writing can also help alert you to relevant topics to include on your own blog. Reading other writers’ work can keep you inspired and offer variety and further information for your most avid readers.

The file name will always follow the format languagecode.mo or languagecode_COUNTRYCODE.mo.For example, en.mo is a generic English language translation. en_GB.mo is an English translation using Great Britain regional spelling.

, Go to the /wp-content directory on your WordPress site's server. If there is not already a folder called /languages, create one with exactly that name.

, Upload the .mo file corresponding to the desired language into your /languages folder. If you have never uploaded files to your server before, you will need to use an FTP client, or the file management system provided by your hosting service. WordPress recommends FileZilla for Windows, or CyberDuck for Mac., Log into your site as an administrator. Click Settings→general→Site Language.

Always be respectful to your followers.,
Always be respectful to other users.,
Study popular blogs.,
Be on as often as possible.",How to Get More Followers on Tumblr1," Liking other people's posts gives off the impression that you're sociable and ready to interact with other users online.


On Tumblr, you can like a page by clicking on the heart icon that appears on the bottom right-hand corner of the main dashboard.
The more posts you like, the more likely (pun intended) you are to receive likes in return!;
, If you are new to Tumblr, you will need to get some content on your blog quickly. Reblogging is a great way to achieve this. Reblogging is when you repost content from another person's blog on to your own page. Reblogging someone else's content helps that user's blog to get more exposure, while also drawing some extra attention to your own. The hope is that they will return the favor by reblogging one of your posts!


To reblog a post, all you need to do is go to the blog post you want to reblog and click the ""reblog"" button at the top of the post. You can add a caption to the post in the ""Caption"" section if you like. Hit ""Reblog Post."" Et voilà! You've reblogged your first post!
If you have multiple Tumblr pages, it is also possible to reblog posts between your own blogs. Simply click ""Reblog"" on any of your own posts and follow the same steps as above.

, Tumblr is a social networking site like Facebook or Twitter, you're there to interact and share with people. To do this you need to follow other bloggers and chances are you will be followed back.


To find blogs to follow, click on the ""Find Blogs"" button on the right-hand side of the screen. From there you can click on topics you're interested in. You'll find everything from poetry to politics, celebrities to cat memes. You can also search for a particular topic or blogger using the search bar.
Once you find a blog you want to follow, simply hit ""Follow"" and their posts will show up on your homepage.

, Treat others as you would like to be treated. Simple as that. Sometimes you might get frustrated with someone who disagrees with you, but remember that it's always more productive to have a civil conversation than an insult-filled flame war.


Avoid sensitive topics. Discussing topics like politics and religion runs the risk of offending certain people. Everyone has the right to an opinion, but when it comes to certain topics sometimes it's best to keep that opinion to yourself, especially if you want to hold on to your followers.
Be polite. If you have a disagreement with one of your followers, remember to handle it it in a calm, respectful manner. Don't say anything on the internet that you wouldn't say to someone's face. Being rude won't win you any favors.
Respond to people. If someone likes one of your posts or leaves an encouraging or helpful comment on your page, remember to return the favor. Social networking is about reciprocation.

, On sites like Tumblr, it's unavoidable that you will come across people that you just don't agree with. You might come across a blog post that gets your blood boiling, but try your best to remain calm and refrain from picking a fight. Everyone has as much right to express their opinion as you do.


Avoid leaving disrespectful comments on other people's pages. You would not appreciate someone else doing it to you and it just invites trouble.
If somebody has an FAQ section on their page, make sure to read it before asking a question.
Read the ""Community Guidelines"" page on the Tumblr site for information on what is considered unacceptable behavior on Tumblr, including bigotry, posting sexually explicit content and harassment.

, Studying popular blogs will allow you to gain some insight into what makes a Tumblr blog popular. Liking or posting comments on a popular blog will also allow you to gain more exposure.


When analyzing blogs with an enviable number of followers, ask yourself what it is that makes that blog so appealing? Does it deal with a particular topic that appeals to a wide range of people? Does the blog owner frequently and consistently interact with their followers? Does the blog mix things up with different types of content, such as photographs, videos and music?
Once you've pinpointed what it is that makes a particular blog so appealing, you can start implementing similar techniques on your own blog!
When you comment on another blog, your Tumblr name will appear with the comment, so if you post something clever or insightful other reader's might just click through to your own blog. Having a catchy username will also help!

, It's important to keep your followers entertained so try to be as active as possible, by posting regular updates, reblogging other people's posts and varying your content. People like consistency and friendliness, so try to interact with as many people as possible while still maintaining good relationships.


If you're going to be away from your computer for awhile, you have the option to queue some things to be posted in your absence.
Keep in mind that posting the same material over and over or posting a hundred times a day is not a good thing. It's repetitive and you run the risk of clogging up other people's feeds. That's a recipe for losing followers.

Chose your blog style.,
Chose a url.,
Follow popular blogs of the same blog type.,
Get a good theme.,
Reblog a lot of posts.,
Self promoting.,
Join Networks.,
Become a botw or botm.,
Repeat the steps.",How to Get a Lot of Tumblr Followers Quickly,"  A solid blog style will help draw attention to your blog from other users who share the same style.  These are some of the most popular styles with large communities behind them.  Understanding your chosen blog style will take time and may slow down the process.  Examples of blog types are:


pale
glow
rosy
bambi
gypsy
indie
cyber
nature
kawaii
pastel
tropical;
,  After choosing your style, chose a url that incorporates your blog type.  Ex: pale princess, glow child, rosylove, bambibabe, mergypsy, indieday, cybershorty, pastel prince, and tropical calypso.  A url that has the name of the blog type will attract people and let them know what to expect on your blog.

,  Learn from them and use them as your inspiration to create an awesome blog. After all, there's a reason they are popular.  Message them and politely ask them to take a look at your blog.  Make sure you follow the people you message, they will most likely check.  Explaining that you are new and admire them will make them more likely to help you.  Ask them blogs they recommend following or look for a blogroll on their blog.  Message and follow those people as well.  If they follow you, they will reblog posts from you and draw their followers to your blog.

,  Googling 'tumblr theme makers' will direct you to a myriad of people who have themes.  Find a theme that is similar to the popular blogs in your style.  Customize it with cute pixels, tabs, banners, etc.  If you do not know how to do this, message around and see if anyone does blog makeovers.  Send them a sweet message asking for a makeover and they will most likely feel obliged to help.

,  Reblogging around 100-200 posts a day will gain attraction to your blog.

,  While not everybody likes it and you may get a few nasty messages once in a while, promoting is worth it.  Self promoting is when you add a short description after reblogging a post.  Click the reblog button and delete other self promotions on a photo, but DO NOT remove original source comments.  Then add a short line such as '✿ new pale blog ✿'; adding symbols is common.  Saying you're a new blog draws curiosity from those who see the line in their activity and they will most likely visit your blog.

,  Look for posts that say the word 'network' in them once your theme is done so you get accepted.  These networks will help you gain followers by putting you in a community and other network members will follow you.  Make sure you accept the network email if you are accepted.

,  A blog of the week or blog of the month is the key to gaining followers fast.  Another user will be promoting you to their followers for a long time and this could gain you almost 200-500 followers.  Usually you can increase your chances of being chosen by making a post and using the username (ex. #mergypsy) of the person hosting the contest, following their other social accounts, messaging them, asking for advice etc.

,  Do these steps repetitively for an intense 2 weeks and you will see the followers come flooding in.

Pick a topic.,
Post high-quality material.,
Be original.,
Be true to yourself.,
Appeal to your current audience.,
Tag your posts.",How to Get More Followers on Tumblr2," Many people center their Tumblr page around a particular topic or theme, such as cooking, photography, fashion etc. When picking a topic you should choose something that genuinely interests and engages you. Otherwise you will get bored with it quickly or run out of ideas. Centering your Tumblr around a certain topic will give your blogs purpose and direction.


Choose carefully. If you pick a topic that's too specific, like ""The Habitats of the Tiger Salamander,"" you will run out of new and interesting things to say pretty quickly. On the other hand, if you make it too broad, by deciding to write about the history of Europe for example, you can easily become overwhelmed.
Think about your potential readers. Who are they? What type of content will appeal to them? How will you sustain their interest?
Write about a hobby. Love fishing? How about knitting? Are you a black belt in karate? Writing about a favorite hobby can be a great place to start when it comes to picking a blog topic, as it is something you enjoy doing and chances are you already know a lot about it.
Write about your kids. Blogs can be a great place to document your children's growth and achievements. You can also interact with other parents and discuss everything from school lunch ideas to innovative ways to get your baby to sleep.
Post photographs. A pictures says a thousand words, right? So if you're a talented photographer why not skip the blather and let your beautiful pics do the talking.

, This simple step cannot be overlooked; if you want to become popular on Tumblr, you need to have a blog with relevant, compelling posts that appeal to a wide audience.


Be sure to check for misspellings and bad grammar. Use paragraphs.
Use all the different types of posts to have a variety of content.

, Posting original, insightful content will attract more followers to a Tumblr than continuously posting recycled content. Aim to be unique. This doesn't mean coming up with an idea that nobody has ever thought of before. It means that your blog should have an authentic voice which reflects your personality.

, No matter what, don't post things that you don't believe in just because you think it will make you more popular. Keep it real!, If you've built up a group of loyal followers by posting your favorite vegetarian recipes, don't suddenly decide to start writing steakhouse reviews instead. It's ok to vary your posts from time to time, but be wary of completely alienating your audience. It's important to continue to interest and engage the followers you currently have, or you risk losing them. If you have decided on a particular topic, stick to it. You can always create a second Tumblr page if you want to explore other interests.

, Tagging your posts in a strategic, yet appropriate way is one of the best opportunities to get more followers on Tumblr. A tag is essentially a keyword that makes it easier for readers to find posts about a specific topic on your blog. For example, you can tag your photographs with the word ""photography"" or your trip posts with the word ""travel.""To get the most out of every post you make, make sure to tag it appropriately.


When choosing tags, avoid picking words that are too specific. Go for broad tags, such as ""Animals"", ""Sports"" or ""Television"" which are certain to have a huge number of existing followers. By tagging your posts with such broad terms, you are maximizing the number of people who'll see your posts and your number of followers will skyrocket!
When you create a post, enter your tags in the last field of the form. You don't need to put a tag in quotes or start with a hashtag. Hit enter after each tag.
To search for tags, enter the tag (or keyword) in the ""Search Tags"" box at the top of your Dashboard.

Post pictures.,
Use custom themes.,
Avoid distracting color schemes.",How to Get More Followers on Tumblr4," Most people are more likely to follow you if there are colorful images on your blog. This includes pictures of yourself - people like to see that there's a real person behind the blog!

, Most people with lots of followers have aesthetically appealing blogs. There are lots of great and free Tumblr themes to choose from. Spend some time looking for just the right theme for your blog. Even if you don’t know any CSS coding, you can still change the background and font colors of your selected Tumblr theme. This option can be found in the ""Preferences"" section under ""Appearance."", Certain color schemes are to be avoided, such as headache-inducing neons or pretty much anything that flashes. Also try to avoid dull, boring colors like gloomy grays and muddy browns."

Think of an Idea.,
Be wary with the swearing.,
Utilise ‘Shared Pragmatic Knowledge.’


If you really want success on Tumblr, you need to learn three important words: Shared Pragmatic Knowledge.,
Be interesting.,
Don’t sweat the small stuff.,
Leave out the smiley faces if you're adding a comment.,
Use second person pronouns.,
Check back often.",How to Create a Successful Tumblr Text Post," The first thing you’re going to need is an idea, but don’t panic! Experts have narrowed down the success of a text post into three genres: Comedy, Debatable issues and Anecdotes. These all have one thing in common, something that is a must for success: they all get a reaction from their audience. Whether the post is funny, serious, or just relatable, good text posts make the audience feel something. Posts frequently include both funny and relatable concepts in the same text, often playing with stereotypes.


Though Tumblr challenge stereotypes, the users seem to pigeonhole themselves as lazy, unemployed students, which is often untrue. It’s less of an insult and more of an inside joke as most users are generally procrastinators. This means that jokes about school, college, or homework/coursework almost always go down well.
Studies have shown that the majority of Tumblr users are 16-24 year old women, so if you’re planning anything sexist you better rethink that quickly. Not only will you get hundreds of feminists putting you down, as well as more hate mail than you can shake a tail at, but you’ll lose all the followers that you've worked so hard for. It’s not just women who get annoyed at these sexists slurs, but men too. A lot of people on Tumblr are accepting and understanding, but unfortunately a few ‘haters’ bring the reputation of the site down.;
, When it comes to expletives and taboo language, or swear words for all of us non-linguists, it really depends on the context. If you’re directing your ‘hate’ at someone specific that you don’t like, then people may become uncomfortable, unless, of course, it’s something or someone the site collectively hates, like Mitt Romney or the Westboro Baptist church- in which case, swear away!


In some contexts expletives can be seen as humorous, but since it’s so touch and go with understanding when it’s appropriate, it’s best to leave it out for now. Once you’ve been on Tumblr for a while, you may start to notice and pick up your own understanding of appropriate usage and will be able to use this to your advantage. Exceptions to the swearing rule are attractive people and really good food, or other satisfying products.

, For those who don’t study English Language, this is the concept of the audience understanding what you’re alluding to based on past experience and knowledge. In layman’s terms, it's getting an inside joke. For example, if you were to talk to a friend about someone you both disliked, you could say, “Oh, it’s her again, the annoying one,” and you’d both understand who you were referring to.
Another example can be seen in most films, where someone alludes to “That thing we have to do. You know, the thing,” followed by copious amounts of winking. As the audience, you are aware that there isn’t something pressing to do, but that the people involved are attempting to escape the situation.
Once you understand the term, you can use Shared Pragmatic Knowledge in your Tumblr Text Post to appeal to a specific audience, say, fans of a certain film or television show.

, Tumblr is different to other social media, so don’t expect to get notes on a few sentences updating the world that you just had a great mocha in Starbucks. Yes, Tumblr is about blogging. No; blogging isn’t a Facebook status. If you want to tell the world about your life, you have to have relatable issues or a really interesting life.


So if you’ve discovered that you’re Bigender, then making a blog about it and subsequent ventures into the other side of your life is perfect. When it comes to the simpler things, say, your friend started talking about you behind your back, then that’s ‘bloggable’ too. People find these things relatable, though you’ll probably have an audience of 12-15 year olds.
If you want your audience to be more mature, you should blog about things relatable to the age of your target audience. If you really want to tell people about little things, like your great mocha or the boy with the great butt in your class, then you should turn it into a somewhat detailed anecdote. Bloggers enjoy detail, so be detailed. Write your experiences as if you were John Green; Tumblr loves John Green.

, You don’t have to be a Grammar Nazi or a qualified linguist to blog. One thing that’s very prevalent about Tumblr is that not everyone cares about presentation. You’ll find that in a lot of text posts, Tumblr users leave out capital letters and punctuation. Good grammar isn’t a bad thing, but it flows an awful lot better when your brain doesn’t have to process the small stuff. The only thing you’ll have to be a linguist for, or at least have a good grasp of the English language for, are the debates.

, Studies show that posts are less successful when users add comments like ‘You can’t not reblog’ or ‘love this!!1! xD’. If you're planning to comment on a post, you should be aware of two guaranteed observations: Tumblr loves jokes, so adding a funny line is almost always a great way to earn notes and subsequently earn followers. The other thing you need to successfully add a comment to a post is an opinion. It sounds pretty simple, but too often you see users typing unneeded things that, to be honest, put people off reblogging. So, whether you’re adding a comment about society being ruled by cissexual white males or against reverse racism, make sure you know what you’re talking about. If you haven’t done your research, then you’ll probably be argued against to the point where you question everything that you’ve ever said.

, A.K.A, type ‘You’. When you type in the second person, it’s like you’re talking directly to whoever is reading what you’ve typed. Which is exactly what’s happening now; You’re reading this as if I’m speaking to you. It makes you feel included, doesn’t it? Inclusion and relation is the point I’m getting at. The audience will be more likely to give you notes if the feel like they’re being included, or if they feel that they can relate to your story. Tumblr users are quite introverted, so a text post that uses the second person is like having a friend tell you an anecdote about the weekend, however briefly. This is a good feeling, aim towards it.

, After you’ve posted your final piece, favourite it and check back every once in a while to see how it’s doing. If it’s got you over a hundred notes, then congratulations – You’ve been successful! If not, don’t panic. It might be that you’re followers live in a different part of the world and just didn’t see it when you posted it, so here’s a tip: Reblog it! There’s nothing wrong with reblogging your own post to capture your audience. However, if the only reason you’re getting notes is because you’ve reblogged it fifty-odd times, then perhaps you need to try a different angle. So, if you haven’t reached your goal, go through the steps again and make sure you haven’t missed anything out!

If your web server has an online control panel, you can access your server files directly through the web management interface. You'll be able to access this when you sign into your site as an administrator. Once you're in the control panel, select the ""File Manager"" option.
If you created your website using a website creation tool like WordPress, Weebly, or Wix, see the platform-specific instructions in the methods below.

, You can upload pretty much any type of file, from PDF files to ZIP files. Note that some servers may limit the size of the file you are allowed to upload, and large files can eat through your allotted bandwidth pretty quickly. Browsers may block potentially malicious files from being downloaded by your visitors, such as EXE or DLL files.


To upload files using your FTP program, drag the file into the folder in the FTP window that you want to upload it to. It will begin uploading immediately. Your upload speeds will typically be much slower than your download speeds, so it may take a while to completely upload the file.
If you are using the virtual control panel file manager, click the ""Upload"" button at the top of the window. Browse your computer for the file you want to upload. Large files may take a while to upload to your server.

, Once the file is uploaded, you'll need to add the link to it on your web page. Open the HTML file that you want to add the link to. You can double-click it in the control panel file manager to open it in the built-in page editor. If you're using an FTP, right-click the HTML file on your server and use ""Open With"" to open it in your code or text editor.

, Place your cursor in the spot in the code that you want to insert your download link. This could be in the body of a paragraph, at the bottom of a page, or anywhere else.

, Enter the following HTML5 code for your download link. This will start the download immediately for users after they click the link. As long as the file to be downloaded is in the same folder as the HTML file, you just need to use the name and extension. If the file is located in another folder, you'll need to include the folder structure.<!-- Uploaded file in same location as HTML file -->
<a href=""examplefile.pdf"" download>Link text</a>
 
<!-- Uploaded file in different location than HTML file -->
<a href=""/path/to/file/examplefile2.jpg"" download>Link text</a>





The <a> download attribute does not work in Safari, Internet Explorer, or Opera Mini. Users with these browsers will open the file in a new page and have to save it manually., You can use an image instead of text to create the download link. This requires a button image already on your web server.





<a href=""examplefile.pdf"" download>
        <img src=""/images/downloadbutton.jpg"">
</a>




, If you define the <a> download attribute, you can change the name for the file when someone downloads it. This can make it easier for users to identify files that they download from you.

, Once you're satisfied with your code, save the changes to your HTML file and reupload it if necessary. You'll be able to see your new download button live on your website.

Before you can learn XHTML, you should first have a basic knowledge of HTML.,
Because XHTML documents are a type of XML document, they need an XML prologue.,
All XHTML documents must have a Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE) right after the XML prologue.,
All tag names must be in lowercase.,
All tags must be closed.,
Tags must be correctly nested.,
All attributes must be quoted.,
Minimized attributes should be written in the long form.,
Separate content and presentation.",How to Learn XHTML," XHTML is written exactly like HTML, with a few stipulations:;
, This should be placed at the very top of your document, and is written like: <?xml version='1.0' encoding=utf-8' ?> Adjust the encoding attribute to the proper encoding of your document. In most cases, this will be UTF-8.

, The current version of XHTML, XHTML 1.0, defines three DTD's. These are ""Strict"", ""Transitional"", and ""Frame set"". Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, use the Strict DTD. The DOCTYPE for the Strict DTD is: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-

, For example, use <p></p> for a paragraph instead of <P></P>.

, For example, if you use <p> to start a paragraph, make sure there is a closing </p> at the end. Empty elements, such as <br> and <img> (which have no content inside of them) must be closed as well. Put a slash at the end of the tag: <br /> is the correct XHTML syntax for a line break.

, This was also a requirement in HTML, but is especially important for XHTML. For example <b><i>Some text</b></i> is incorrect, because the <b> tag is being closed before the <i> tag even though it started first. The correct syntax would be: <b><i>Some text</i></b>.

, In HTML it would be valid to write <a href=nextPage.html>Next Page</a>. However, in XHTML all attributes must be quoted: <a href=""nextPage.html"">Next Page</a>.

, For example: <input type=""checkbox"" checked> should be <input type=""checkbox"" checked=""checked"" />).

, Use XHTML for the content of your document (such as text, images, links, etc.) and use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to dictate how that content should be displayed to the user. HTML tags that are used for presentation (such as <font>) should not be used.

, You will find that there are very many properties. However, it is not necessary to learn them all.


Some good basic CSS properties to know are color and font-family.

, All properties need a value. For the color property, for example, you might put the red value.

, It is used within an element like href or src. To use it, within the quotation marks after the equal sign, put the CSS attribute, a colon, and then the value of the property. This is known as a CSS rule.

, Inline CSS can add unnecessary clutter to an HTML document. However, it is a great way to get introduced to how CSS works.

, It should allow you to create HTML and CSS files.


If you don't have a special program installed, you can use Notepad or another text editor. Simply save your file both as a text file and a CSS file.

, You should open this with an HTML editor as well, if you have one installed.


HTML editors allow you to edit HTML and CSS at the same time.

, This will let you write CSS without the need for a separate file.

, To make your code more legible, always put the second curly brace on its own line.

, Each line must end with a semicolon (;). To make your code legible, each rule should start on its own line and each line should be indented.


It is very important to note that this styling will affect all elements of the selected type on the page. More specific styling will be covered in the next section.

, Open your HTML file as well.

, This will allow you to link a separate CSS file to your HTML document. Your link tag needs three attributes: rel, type, and href.



rel means ""relationship"" and tells the browser what the relationship is to the HTML document. Here it should have a value of ""stylesheet"".

type tells what type of media is being linked to. Here it should have a value of ""text/css""


href here is used similarly to how it is used in an <a> element, but here it must link to a CSS file. If the CSS file is located in the same folder as the HTML file, only the file name needs to be written within the quotation marks.

, Add a class attribute to these elements and set them equal to a class name of your choice. This will give your elements the same styling.

, Type the class name in your CSS file with a period (.) preceding it (i.e. .class).

, Id's are created in CSS using a pound symbol (#) rather than a period.


Id's are more specific than classes, so an id will override any class styling if it has an attribute with a different value than the class.

, It is an official website aimed at teaching web development skills. The w3 has plenty of references listed for HTML and CSS, as well as other web languages.

, Sites like CSS tricks.com specifically are aimed at teaching CSS and web design skills. Finding reputable sources will help you on your learning journey.

Begin by opening a simple text editor such as Notepad (in the Accessories folder of the Windows programs menu).,
The first style modifications you will make are going to affect the entire web page so you will begin by adjusting the background color and text color of the entire page.,
Now try changing the background color by typing background-color: immediately followed by the color code and ending the line with a semicolon (each line within a style tag must be ended by a semicolon).,
To affect the text color type color: followed by the desired color.,Close the body tag by typing an ending }

,In this example, we will make similar changes to the <h1> tag (Header 1) by next typing h1 {

,
Modify the font that will be used by the browser to render any text contained in this tag.,
To modify the size of the text, type font-size: followed by the desired size.,
Change the color of the text using the same methods defined above for affecting the body style.,Don't forget to close the h1 style definition by typing }

,

,
Once you are satisfied with your style definitions you must save the file in a format that the browser will recognize.,
Still using your text editor, open the html file where you wish to link the CSS.

,
Insert the following line of code somewhere between the <head> tags: '''<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""styles.css"" media=""all"">'''

link rel=""stylesheet"" (The link relationship with the document, is a stylesheet)






type=""text/css"" - tells the browser what type of document you are linking to.,
Refresh or open your browser to see the changes you've made to your web page.

, First type body {

, The color code can be entered in several ways.

Hexadecimal notation - a six-digit alpha-numeric code that lists the red, green and blue values, in that order, for that color. (i.e. #000000 is black, #FFFFFF is white, #FFFF00 is yellow).






Red, Green, Blue percentage - uses a percentage value to denote how much of each color is represented (i.e. rgb(100%, 100%, 0%) is yellow and rgb(100%, 50%, 0%) is orange).






Red, Green Blue values - this technique is similar to the percentage but the value used is from 0 to 128 (i.e. rgb(128,128,128) is white and rgb(64,64,64) is grey).






Color name - certain colors can be entered as a text value like black, white, red, blue, green.







, Use any of the techniques listed above for changing the background-color.

,,, Here we will be using the verdana font which is one of the default fonts installed with most Windows operating systems. A good rule of thumb is to list two desired font-types and then a font class. You would implement this by typing font-family: verdana, arial, sans serif; However, as we've shown here, you can simply chose just one font.

, The size can be defined in pixels and ems. For now, define the text size at 22px.

, In this example we're making the text grey by typing the hexadecimal color codecolor: #CCCCCC;

,,, In this case we will save the file as styles.css though you can actually name the file as you chose so long as it ends in .css (i.e. mystyle.css, myfile.css, sitestyle.css). For people using Windows Notepad, make sure that the ""Save as type"" drop down box says ""All files"" or an additional .txt file extension will be added. For this example, we will also save our CSS in the same folder as the web page we are working on.

,,






href=""styles.css"" - the path to the location of the style sheet.






media=""all"" - specifies the type of media the link tag is referencing.

Familiarize yourself with the CSS comment code.,
Use the comment in the CSS sections of your code.,
Use comments to prevent code from being run.,
Use comments to explain a piece of potentially confusing code.,
Use comments to create documentation within the code.,
Use invalid CSS to create temporary single-line comments.",How to Comment in CSS," CSS uses the C-like ""comment block""-style comments: /*---*/. This allows for multi-line comments, and you can quickly use it to disable portions of your code./* Everything between the starting and ending tags will be a comment */


;
, Only the parts of your page that are processed as CSS will support the comments. This means they will work in your CSS style page, as well a the <style> block of your HTML page. They will not work on other parts of the HTML page. If you need to comment in a HTML block, use HTML comments.





<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p {
    color: #93B874; /*You can create comments at the end of lines */
    /* Or you can create comments between lines */
    font-family: ""times"";
} 
 
/* You can create multi-line comments.
Everything between the two comment tags will
not be processed when displaying the page */
</style>
</head>
<body>
 
<p> This is a standard HTML paragraph. The comments above will not appear on the page. </p>
 
</body>
</html>




, One of the more important uses for comments is to prevent pieces of code from being processed. This is great for testing changes and debugging code.





<style>
p {
    color: #93B874; 
    /* font-family: ""times""; */
} 
 
/* The comment tags above will prevent the
""font-family"" attribute from being applied */
 
</style>




, You don't need to comment every line of code that you enter, as CSS is fairly self-explanatory, but it's useful to include comments for code that may not be immediately obvious at first glance. This not only helps people who may be collaborating or learning from your code, it can also help you remind yourself about the function of the code.





<style>
img {
        opacity: 0.5;
        filter: alpha(opacity=50); /* For IE6-8 */ 
}
 
/* The comment above indicates that the code on 
that line is for Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 */
 
</style>




, You can create detailed documentation for your code using CSS comments and other characters. This allows you to explain the function of the program and provide instructions for other coders/users. CSS compression will automatically strip this out when it comes time to run the code, so you don't have to worry about length affecting the size of the file./***********************************

, CSS doesn't have a ""single-line"" comment function, like // in JavaScript. You can, however, use use invalid CSS at the beginning of a line to keep the following function from being processed. This isn't considered good practice for major debugging, but it can be useful in a quick pinch.<style>

Understand how css works with HTML.,
To change text font, use css'

font-family

For example:

<span style=""font-family:times;"">Text</span>

will cause ""Text"" to use the Times font.

,
To set an order of preference, in case a particular font is not on a person's computer, use commas to separate font names.,
To set text color, use css'

font

For example:

<span style=""font:red;"">Text</span>

will cause ""Text"" to be red.",How to Change a Webpage Text Font and Color Using CSS," For example:

<span style=""(css)"">Text</span>

Almost any HTML tag can include ""style,"" such as

p

or

div

What goes in between the quotes is the CSS part.;
,, For example:

<span style=""font-family:times, georgia, serif;"">Text</span>

will cause ""Text"" to use the Times font. If times is not available, Georgia will be used. If neither Times nor Georgia are available, a generic serif font will be used.

, You can use any valid HTML color name in the place of ""red."" You can also use a hex code. For example:

<span style=""font:#FFFFFF;"">Text</span>

will cause ""Text"" to be white.

"
Use the ""text-decoration"" CSS style property.,
Use the <span> tag when you want to underline a certain piece of text.,
Declare HTML elements in the <style> section of your page.,
Create a CSS class to quickly underline at any time.,
Consider other methods for highlighting text.",How to Underline Text in HTML1," Using the <u> tag is no longer the proper way to underline text. Instead, use the ""text-decoration"" CSS property.


This helps make your code future-proof so that you don't have to go back and change things once the old code becomes unusable.;
, Place the opening tag along with the ""text-decoration"" property where you want to start underlining. Place the closing </span> where you want it to stop.<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">This will be underlined.</span>




, You can also do this on the CSS style sheet. You can make the underlining process much easier by declaring HTML elements to style. For example, to make all of your level 3 headers underlined, add the following to your CSS style section:





<html>
<head>
<style>
h3 {
        text-decoration: underline;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h3>This header will be underlined</h3>
</body>
</html>




, In your style sheet or <style> section, you can create classes to call later. The class can have any name you'd like.





<html>
<head>
<style>
.underline {
        text-decoration: underline;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
You can use this class to 
<div class=""underline"">quickly underline</div> different parts 
<div class=""underline"">of your content</div>
</body>
</html>




, Underlining should be avoided to keep from confusing your reader. One popular method is to use the <em> tag, which italicizes text. You can use CSS to further define this tag for unique emphasis.





<html>
<head>
<style>
em {
        color: red;
}
</style>

Anything that uses the em element will be 
<em>italicized (because of the default settings), 
as well as red</em> because of the additional

Avoid using the old <u></u> tags.,
Use the <u></u> tags to underline (demonstration only).",How to Underline Text in HTML2," This has been ""deprecated"", which means it works but is no longer in use or recommended. This is because HTML is not designed to style content. The <u> tag will still work, but is now supposed to represent text that is different than the other text, such as misspelled words or Chinese proper nouns.

, There is virtually no case where you should be using this method anymore. It can be good to know how it was used in case you have to update an old website.





<html>
<body>
The old underline tag in HTML <u>allowed you to underline 
things quickly</u>, but it made things a mess when other 
style elements got involved. This is why modern underlining 
is accomplished using the ""text-decoration"" CSS element.

Understand HTML.,
Write or copy HTML into a basic text editor.,
Save the file as your-file.html.,
Make sure that there is a browser installed on your computer.,
Find the saved file.,
Right-click (Windows) or double-click (Mac) the file and select ""Open with"" from the action menu.,
View your HTML file in your chosen browser.,
Alternate method: Run your browser, then press Ctrl-O.,
Open your preferred FTP platform.,
Next, connect to your remote server (your website's server).,
Locate your HTML file and drag it into the box.,
Wait until the file is uploaded.",How to Run a HTML File," HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML files are text files which represent the content and the layout of a web page. To read an HTML file, you can use any text editor (e.g notepad, notepad++, or any specialized HTML editor). However, if you want to see what the program looks like, you need to run it on a web browser, which is designed to read and render HTML files.;
, As you become a more proficient coder, you can use HTML editing programs like Adobe Dreamweaver, Microsoft Expression Web, and Coffee cup HTML Editor, but a simple program is all you need to start. Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac) should suffice.

, If you make an HTML file in Notepad, TextEdit, or any other text editor, be sure to save it with the proper notation. Before saving the file, make sure that you have changed your ""Save as type"" to ""All files"" (if needed) and click ""Save"".

, To run a HTML file on your computer you must have a browser.

, If you think the file is in a certain folder, but you cannot find it, try running a file search on your computer. Type your-file.html into the search box at the bottom of the Start menu (if using Windows) or the search box in the Finder app (if using a Mac).


HTML files usually are in a folder with the same name as the .html file but without the .html extension. Inside of the folder may be different files such as .js .css , images and other files. Do not worry about those, they are necessary files for the layout and functionality of the page. It is necessary not to delete these files. Leave them in the same directory (folder) as your html file, otherwise the page won't display properly. If you would like to modify an html file, you will need to learn coding in html and other scripting languages

, You will be able to choose between any of the browsers that are installed on your computer, although your computer's default browser will top the list. Open the file using any web browser: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.


Most computers will associate your default browser with the .html file extension. That means that normally, you don't need to find a browser to open the file—you can just double-click on it, and the computer will open it in your default web browser.
If your computer doesn't recognize the file, Windows will ask whether to open this file using an already installed application, or search for the extension on the internet. Select the ""open using already installed applications"" option. You will be able to choose from a list of all browsers installed on the system.

, The browser automatically interprets your coding and displays it. The location of the file will be displayed in the address bar—this will help you confirm that the HTML file has been opened, and not any other.

, This should pull up an ""Open"" menu. Find your file, double-click it, and watch your program open up in a browser tab. Different browsers may have different ""Open"" hotkeys, so check your browser settings.

, If your host has one built in, stick with that—it will make it a lot simpler. If not, use a third-party FTP host like FileZilla.

, If you're using the built-in platform, you don't need to worry about this. You'll see two boxes on the left and two boxes on the right. Don't worry about the left or top right ones; all you need to focus on is the bottom right box.

, It will start the upload right away. If you're using the built-in platform, find and locate the ""htdocs"" (or default HTML) folder and press ""Upload""; it will give you options from there.


Don't use the shortcut! This will upload the LNK Mirror file, which you don't want.

, Then, if you've removed the default page, go and view your website to see your HTML file! If you see a directory listing, click the .html file to view.

Type the ""body"" element inside the <style></style> tags.,
Add the ""background-image"" property to the ""body"" element.,
Layer multiple images.",How to Set Background Color in HTML2," Many people prefer to use an image as the background for their website. This allows you to make your background a pattern, texture, photo, or any other kind of image. As of HTML5, all types of backgrounds should be set with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) inside of the <style></style> tags.

, All of the style information for your page (including the background color) should be coded between these tags. If you already have <style> tags set, just scroll to that part of the file.





<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
 
<style>
body {

</style>
</head>
<body>
</body>

, When you add this property, you'll need the file name of your image. Make sure the image file is stored in the same folder as the HTML file (or enter the full path to the file on your web server).<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
    background-image: url(""imagename.png"");

</body>
</html>





It's a good idea to also add the background-color property, just in case the background image doesn't load.

, You can stack multiple images on top of each other. This can be useful if you have images with transparent backgrounds that complement each other when layered.





<!DOCTYPE html>

Use CSS to create a gradient background.,
Understand the basic syntax.,
Make a vertical gradient.,
Make a directional gradient.,
Use other properties to adjust the gradient.",How to Set Background Color in HTML3," If you're looking for something a little more stylized than a solid color, yet not as busy as a multi-colored animation, try a gradient background. Gradients are colors that fade into other colors. You can use CSS to create and customize your gradient. Before you try making a gradient, make sure you understand the basics of styling a page with CSS.

, When making a gradient, there are two pieces of information you'll need: the starting point/angle, and the colors that the gradient will transition between. You can select multiple colors to have the gradient move between all of them, and you can set a direction or angle for the gradient.background: linear-gradient(direction/angle, color1, color2, color3, etc.);




, If you don't specify the direction, the gradient will go from top to bottom. Different browsers have different implementations of the gradient function, so you'll have to include several versions of the code.





<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
html {
    min-height: 100%; /* This is required to ensure that the gradient stretches across the whole page */
}
 
body {
    background: -webkit-linear-gradient(#93B874, #C9DCB9); /* Chrome 10+, Safari 5.1+ */
    background: -o-linear-gradient(#93B874, #C9DCB9); /* Opera 11.1+ */
    background: -moz-linear-gradient(#93B874, #C9DCB9); /* Firefox 3.6+ */
    background: linear-gradient(#93B874, #C9DCB9); /* Standard syntax (must be last) */
    background-color: #93B874; /* It's a good idea to set a background color in case the gradient doesn't load */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>




, Adding a direction to the gradient will allow you to change the way the color shift appears. Note that different browsers have different ways of interpreting directions. All will result in the same gradient.<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
html {
    min-height: 100%;
}
 
body {
    background: -webkit-linear-gradient(left, #93B874, #C9DCB9); /* from left to right */
    background: -o-linear-gradient(right, #93B874, #C9DCB9); /* ending on the right */
    background: -moz-linear-gradient(right, #93B874, #C9DCB9); /* ending on the right */
    background: linear-gradient(to right, #93B874, #C9DCB9); /* moving to the right */
    background-color: #93B874; /* It's a good idea to set a background color in case the gradient doesn't load */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>




, There's a lot more that you can do with gradients.


For example, not only can you add more than two colors, you can also put a percentage after each one. This will allow you to set how much spacing you want each color segment to have.




background: linear-gradient(#93B874 10%, #C9DCB9 70%, #000000 90%);





Add transparency to your colors. This will make the color fade. Use the same color to fade from the color to nothing. You'll need to use the rgba() function to define the color. The ending value determines the transparency: 0 for solid and 1 for transparent.




background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(147,184,116,0), rgba(147,184,116,1));

Navigate to the <style> part of your HTML code.,
Add the animation property to the ""body"" element.,
Add your colors to the animation.",How to Set Background Color in HTML4," If a single solid background color is not your thing, try experimenting with this animated, color-changing background. As of HTML 5, background colors should be defined by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). If you've never set a background color with CSS, see Setting a Solid Background Color before trying this method.

, You'll have to add 2 different properties, as different browsers require different code.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
    -webkit-animation: colorchange 60s infinite; 
    animation: colorchange 60s infinite;
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>






-webkit-animation is the property required for Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Opera, Safari). animation is the standard for all other browsers.

colorchange is what you'll call the animation in this example.

60s is the duration (60 seconds) of the animation/transition. Make sure to set it for both the webkit and standard syntax.

infinite tells the animation to repeat forever. If you'd rather the colors loop one time and then stop at the last color, you can leave this part out.

, Now you'll use the @keyframes rule to set the background colors through which you'll cycle, as well as the length of time each color will appear on the page. Again, you'll need separate entries for the different sets of browsers.<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
 
body {
    -webkit-animation: colorchange 60s infinite; 
    animation: colorchange 60s infinite;
}
 
 
@-webkit-keyframes colorchange {
 
     0%  {background: #33FFF3;}
    25%  {background: #78281F;}
    50%  {background: #117A65;}
    75%  {background: #DC7633;}
    100% {background: #9B59B6;}
}
 
 
@keyframes colorchange {
     0%  {background: #33FFF3;}
    25%  {background: #78281F;}
    50%  {background: #117A65;}
    75%  {background: #DC7633;}
    100% {background: #9B59B6;}
}   
 
</style>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>





Note that the two rules (@-webkit-keyframes and @keyframes have the same background colors and percentages. You'll want these to stay uniform so the experience is the same on all browsers.
The percentages (0%, 25%, etc) are of the total animation length (60s). When the page loads, the background will be the color set at 0% (#33FFF3). Once the animation has played for 25% of of 60 seconds, the background will turn to #78281F, and so on.
You can modify the times and colors to fit your desired outcome.

Use this for personal projects only.,
Insert the marquee tags around the blinking text.,
Set the text width.,
Set the scrollamount to the same value as the width.,
Change the scroll delay.,
Limit the number of blinks (optional).",How to Make Text Blink in HTML1," The marquee tag is obsolete, and developers are strongly encouraged to avoid it. Different browsers will display it differently, and future updates could prevent the text from blinking at all.Learn the Javascript approach instead if you are creating a professional web site.


Google Chrome does not support the ""scrollamount"" attribute, which this method relies on.In that browser, your text will scroll across the page instead of blinking.;
, Open your HTML document in a simple text editor. Type <marquee> in front of the text you would like to blink. Type </marquee> after the text.


As always, set up your HTML page first with <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

, Change the opening tag to <marquee width=""300"">. This will not change the size of your font. There are two reasons why you might need to change this to a different number:


If your text does not fit, it will scroll instead of blinking. Increase the width to prevent this.
In Chrome, the text will scroll across a distance determined by the width.

, Inside the same tag, write scrollamount=""300"" (or the same number as the width). By default, marquee text scrolls across the page. By setting the scroll amount to the same number as the width, the text will ""scroll"" into the same position it was already in. This causes a blink effect.


Your text should now look something like this:
<marquee width=""300"" scrollamount=""300"">Blinking text here.</marquee>.

, Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the effect. If the text is blinking too quickly or too slowly, change the speed with the attribute scrolldelay=""500"". The default delay is set to 85.Use a higher number for a slower blink, or a lower number for a faster blink.


You should now have:
<marquee width=""300"" scrollamount=""300"" scrolldelay=""500"">Blinking text here.</marquee>

, Many web users find blinking text annoying. To stop the animation once you've grabbed the reader's attention, enter loop=""7"". Now the text will blink seven times, then disappear. (You can use any number instead of seven.)


The completed code:
<marquee width=""300"" scrollamount=""300"" scrolldelay=""500"" loop=""7"">Blinking text here.</marquee>

"
"
Insert a blink script into the head of your HTML document.,
Insert the command to load your script.,
Define your blinking text as an announcement.,
Adjust the script.",How to Make Text Blink in HTML2," In between the <head> and </head> tags of your HTML document, insert the following JavaScript code:function blinktext() {
  var f = document.getElementById('announcement');
  setInterval(function() {
    f.style.visibility = (f.style.visibility == 'hidden' ? '' : 'hidden');
  }, 1000);
}

, The code above defined a function and named it ""blinktext."" In order to use this function in your HTML, change the <body> tag to <body onload=""blinktext();"">.

, This script only affects elements with the id ""announcement."" Place your blinking text inside any element and give it that id. For example, type <p id=""announcement"">Blinking text here.</p> or <div id=""announcement"">Blinking text here.</div>.


You can rename this anything you like. Just make sure to use the same word in the script and the element id.

, The number ""1000"" in the script sets the delay between blinks. This is in microseconds, so a value of 1000 makes the text blink once per second.Change this to a lower number to speed up the blinking, or a higher number to slow it down.


The actual delay probably won't match this value perfectly. It tends to be slightly shorter, but can take longer if your browser is busy with other requests.

Understand what an HTML ""tag"" is.,
Nest the HTML tags.,
If you want a font in two different sections of your webpage, and they are adjacent, just enclose both sections in the font tag.,
Get into this habit early when learning to properly code pages.",How to Nest HTML Tags," An HTML tag or element is something that changes the formatting of an HTML webpage.

They are enclosed in triangular brackets: <> and </>.
They do everything from creating a marquee style scroll, to changing font size and color.;
, To properly nest the tags, you must properly close the tags. If you open a ""head"" tag and open a ""title"" tag, then before you can move on to the ""body"" tag"", you must close the ""title"" tag.


An HTML element will not work if the tags are incorrectly nested. There are no exceptions.

, If they aren't adjacent, then you'll just have to use the tag twice.

For example: <TAG1><TAG2><TAG3></TAG3></TAG2></TAG1>

, This should include the <html>, <head> (and accompanying end-tag) and <title>

,


Recognize that these tags work well, when they are partnered with regular text without much formatting. Although they aren't centered by default, with a little work they can be, but they form a backbone that symbolizes something looking like a title to a paragraph or other text in the HTML page.
Realize that these tags have certain levels of headings that can be formed ranging from <h1> to <h6> although the h1 level and potentially h2 level should be all that you should really need in the long run.
Recognize that as the number gets larger, the text size will get smaller, but will start out pretty big.
Recognize that these tags already are shown in boldface, so there should be no reason to have to manually boldface them. However, these tags are also deprecated in the current version of HTML, so they are not widely used anymore.

, With nearly 10 ""h"" levels, there are nearly endless choices on how many levels down you'll need to cast your heading into the document. An example would be <h1> for a top-level heading/header.

,, In this earlier case, it's the <h1> tag, which has an accompanying </h1> end-tag.

Strip any formatting styles, borders and colors from your table and record them.,
Create the pixel shim image.,
Upload the image to your web-server using the method you normally would use to upload files and record the path to the uploaded image.

,
Put your table into another table's cell surrounding it with cells from all sides you want to create spacing on.,
Add the styling and border you striped in step 1 to the cell containing the original table.,
Adjust the outer table's properties to allow floating texts and objects on the side you desire using the style attribute.

,
Use the following table as a guide for placing spacing in the four directions:




<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan=""3"">
      <img src=""shim_image_path.jpg"" height=""TOP_SPACING""/>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>]
    <td>
      <img src=""shim_image_path.jpg"" width=""LEFT_SPACING""/>
    </td>
    <td>
      ORIGINAL_TABLE_CODE
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src=""shim_image_path.jpg"" width=""RIGHT_SPACING""/>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan=""3"">
      <img src=""shim_image_path.jpg"" height=""BOTTOM_SPACING""/>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>




Where: TOP_SPACING, LEFT_SPACING, RIGHT_SPACING and BOTTOM_SPACING are all integers denoting the different spacings you want to place, and ORIGINAL_TABLE_CODE the original code of your table after stripping any styling and, especially, borders.",How to Shim Text Around a Table in HTML,"
For example:




<table border=""5"" style=""background-color: red;"">
  <tr>
    <td>table content</td>
  </tr>
</table>





Would Become:




<table>
  <tr>
    <td>table content</td>
  </tr>
</table>



;
, This is easy to do using any simple paint program. Using MS Paint:

Open MS Paint and create a new image from the File->New menu.






Paint the image with the background color of the page you will put the table in.






Go to Image->Attributes menu item.






Fill in the width and height of your shim image (usually, 1px by 1px will do). Usually you will make width and height equal.






Save the image.

,, For example, if you want to create a spacing on the right side of the table, you will put the table in another table with one row containing two cells. The table will be added in the left cell and the image will be added to the right cell as follows:




<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>table content</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src=""put_path_to_your_image"" width=""x"" height=""x"" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>




Where the the second table is: This is the original table and x inside the img tag is the number of pixels you want to leave as spacing.

, The above example would become:




<table>
  <tr>
    <td style=""background-color: red; border-width: 5px;"">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>table content</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src=""put_path_to_your_image"" width=""x"" height=""x"" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>




Sometimes the border will not work properly so you'll have to try to set some other styles as well.

,, Note how the most important properties to set for the images are width for horizontal spacing and height for vertical spacing.

Type out the code for the link.,
Use the href attribute to move to specific parts of a page.,
Use the href attribute to load specific files.,
Create a button link.,
Use CSS to change the visual style of your link.,
Adjust each selector.,
Build the style sheet.,
Use multiple styles on one page.",How to Make Links," Links in HTML are defined with the <a> tag. Tags need to have a beginning and an end. This means that links start with the <a> tag and end with the </a> tag. The address you are linking to goes in the first <a> tag designated by the href attribute, and the displayed text for the link goes between the tags. A completed HTML link would look similar to the one above:


The finished link would appear as wikiHow Home Page and would be clickable.;
, You can designate locations on your page that you want the browser to go to when specific links are clicked. For example, you could place a link at the bottom of a long article that will return you to the top of the page. To do this, you need to create the “anchor” that you can refer to with the link:For this example, this code anchor would be placed at the top of the page, either in the header or at the beginning of the body.








This link would be placed at the end of the page. Clicking the link would scroll the page back to the top.







, You can use the href attribute to point to specific files instead of an absolute path. This is useful if you are moving files around often and don’t want your links to break. The files need to be in the current page’s directory in order for this link to work.


This will link to the index.htm file located in the same directory as the current page.

, If you’d rather have your link displayed as a clickable button instead of underlined text, you can use the <form> tag to create the link. This will replace the <a> tag method of creating links. Buttons are not crawled as well by search engine spiders, which means button links don’t get indexed as efficiently as traditional links.

, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to alter the feel of your HTML links. Creating a CSS style and placing it between the <head></head> section of the page will affect all of the <a> tags on your page. There are four selectors which determine the style of the link:a:link – This is what an unvisited link looks like.

a:visited – This is what a visited link looks like.

a:active – This is what a clicked link looks like.

a:hover – This is what a link looks like when the mouse is hovering over it.

, You can add modifiers to each selector in the style section to change the way the link will look. There are a large number of style elements that you can change by placing the modifiers in braces after the selector. Examples of modifiers include:font-family - This is the font that the link will appear in. You can name any web-enabled font using this modifier.

font-size - This is the size of the font, in points. You can change it like you would in a word processor.

color – This is the color of the link. You can either type out the color (“blue”) or use the color code (“#0000FF”).

text-decoration – This give the links effects such as underline or strikethrough.font-weight – You can use this modifier to make the font bold.

, Your CSS style guide should be properly formatted and placed in the heading of the page. An example style sheet might look like the one above:

, If you want to have multiple link styles on one web page, you can create multiple CSS style sheets and assign each one a class. You would then refer to that class when you want that style to be applied. An example is shown above:

Follow, reblog, like, and even print out pictures of people who look the way you want to look, or have blogs you're trying to imitate. Take screenshots and set your desktop background to be a rotating display of these images. You might even want to have a special notebook where you keep these pictures and make notes on what you like/don't like, how you'd wear certain pieces,etc.;
, Pick out clothing you think you can work with and try to arrange it in combinations that work for your personal style. If you don't think you can work with something in your closet, set it to the side. Remember: even majorly out-of-date clothing can be saved with a pair of scissors and a bit of imagination.

, For help with your clothing and style, both Tumblr and Polyvore will help immensely. Pinterest is also useful; searching for ""hipster"" or ""clothing"" can yield great results.

, Visit stores like Forever 21, where you can stock up on a ton of new, hipster-esque clothes without spending too much money. Thrift stores are another great option! Again, don't forget that everything can be modified. So even if you think that something you're buying isn't that cute, or looks too tight or too long or too ruffly for you, think of the possibilities before disregarding it completely.

, You'll want lots of accessories such as crucifix necklaces, rings, and bracelets. String bracelets and anklets are also very popular. Forehead headbands with little flowers and beads can look nice, but only if you have relatively tame hair.

, Think Vans, Converse, military boots, gladiator sandals, etc. If you're extra daring you can even try to pull off skate shoes or Doc Martens. And of course, heels and wedges are always an elegant twist!

, Tumblr girls have flawless skin. If you have acne or pimples, use an acne cleanser to keep your pimples under control. Use foundation to cover your pimples or blemishes if you have too, but make sure it's powder foundation. Don't apply too much or your skin will look splotchy and make sure it matches your skin tone.

, The most popular style is long with beachy waves, but pixie cuts, bangs, and very curly hair are also common. If you're coveting a particular hairstyle that you don't have the right quantity of hair to do, consider getting a haircut or extensions. Try straightening, curling, braiding, whatever you want to try to create your own unique hipster style--when you get it right, you'll definitely know.


Tumblr girls either have curly hair (ringlets or loose curls) or straight hair. Many also opt for a more messy ""just got out of bed"" look. If you're going to straighten your hair, make sure it's perfectly flat and pretty. For curling, use a big barrel curler to achieve loose curl look, or simply but your hair in a twisted knot bun after your shower. Also, try different styles with your hair: braid it, fishtail it, put it in a bun, put it in an up do, make a side braid, etc. Play around with it! Tumblr girls have many different styles.
Hair color. Many hipster or Tumblr have ombré style hair. You can do this at the hairdresser. Some also just have their tips dyed a different color to add flare. If you don't wish to change your hair color, then keep your style! Tumblr hipster girls are also natural.

, The casual, everyday Tumblr hipster look is little foundation with eyeshadow in a natural tone, plus mascara and eyeliner and nude lips. For parties or a more formal look you can use virtually any brightly colored eyeshadow. Then put on your eyeliner a little thicker than usual and add light pencil eyeliner along the waterline in black. Finish off your special occasion Tumblr hipster look with coral or bright red lips.


Wear mascara. Mascara is the most important part of your tumblr girl look. Make sure you don't clump the mascara and buy some more often so it doesn't dry up. You can wear a light or natural colored eyeshadow but don't apply too much. Some Tumblr girls wear eyeliner to define their eyes well but if you're going to apply some, don't overdo it! Nude lips or a clear balm for the lips.

, Once you've got your look perfected, start a hipster Tumblr and show off your good looks. Take pictures of yourself from flattering angles and use a lot of tags, like ""#makeup"" or ""#hair"" or ""#love"". You'll be on your way to being Tumblr famous in no time!


Start by taking selfies in good lighting and in the right positions. Edit your selfies with filters to give it that extra tumblr look!

Make it a link.",How to Insert Images with HTML," There are many free image hosting services, such as Picasa Web Albums, Imgur, Flickr, or Photobucket. Read the terms carefully. Some services will reduce your image quality, or take down your image if too many people view it (since this uses up the host's bandwidth).


Some blog-hosting services let you upload images using the blog administrator tools.
If you have a paid web host, upload the image to your own site using an FTP service. Creating an ""images"" directory is recommended to keep your files organized.If you want to use an image on another website, ask the creator for permission. If she grants it, download the image, then upload the image to an image hosting site.

, Open the HTML document for the web page where the image will be displayed.


If you are trying to insert an image on a forum, you can type directly in the post. Many forums use a custom system instead of HTML. Ask for help from other forum-goers if this doesn't work.

, Find the point in your HTML body where you'd like to insert an image. Write the tag <img> here. This is an empty tag, meaning it stands alone, with no closing tag. Everything you need to display your image will go inside the two angle brackets.


<img>

, Visit the web page where your image is hosted. Right-click the image (control-click on Mac) and select ""Copy Image Location."" You can also click ""View Image"" to see the image alone on a page, then copy the URL in your address bar.


If you uploaded the image to an images directory in your own website, link to it with /images/yourfilenamehere. If this doesn't work, the images directory is probably inside another folder. Move it up to the root directory.

, As you may already know, HTML attributes go inside a tag to modify it. The src attribute is short for ""source,"" and tells the browser where to look to find the image. Write src="" "" and paste the image URL in between the quotation marks. Here's an example:


<img src=""http:

, Technically your HTML has everything it needs to display the image, but it's best to add an alt attribute as well. This tells the browser what text to display when the image fails to load. More importantly, this helps search engines figure out what your image is about, and lets screen readers describe the image to visually impaired visitors.Follow this example, changing the text inside the quotation marks:


<img src=""http:
If the image is not important to the page content, include the alt attribute with no text (alt="""")., Save the HTML file to your website. Visit the page you just edited, or refresh the page if you already had it open. You should now see your image. If it's the wrong size or you're unhappy with it for another reason, continue to the next section.

, For best results, resize the image using free editing software, then upload the new version. Setting the width and height using HTML tells the browser to shrink or expand the image, which can be inconsistent across browsers and (rarely) cause display errors.If you want a quick and serviceable adjustment, use this format:



<img src=""http: (Number of pixels, or the more phone-friendly ""CSS pixels"" in HTML5.)or <img src=""http: (Percentage of web page dimensions, or percentage of HTML element containing the image.)

If you only enter one attribute (width or height), the browser should preserve the width:height ratio.

, The title attribute can be used to add an additional comment or information about the image. For example, you can credit the artist here. In most cases, this text will be displayed when the visitor hovers the cursor over the image.


<img src=""http:

, To make an image that's also a link, insert the image tag inside the <a></a> hyperlink tag. Here's an example:


<a href=""http:<img src=""http:</a>

Insert a non-breaking space.,
Insert white space of different widths.,
Mimic a tab with non-breaking spaces.,
Indent paragraphs with CSS.",How to Insert Spaces in HTML2," Normally, HTML will only display one space between words, no matter how many times you press the space bar. To force an extra space to show up, type &nbsp; or &#160;.This displays a character called a ""non-breaking space,"" which will always appear.


This is called a non-breaking space because it prevents a line break at its location. If you overuse this character, browsers will have trouble inserting line breaks in a tidy, readable way., There are several other character entities that tell the browser to display white space. Different browsers may display these in slightly different ways, but unlike &nbsp;, these shouldn't affect your line breaks:&ensp; — named after the ""N"" block of a printing press, the en space is about the width of two normal spaces

&emsp; — the em space, roughly four normal spaces

, One way to indent a paragraph is to insert several non-breaking spaces in a row: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. This works as an HTML-only solution, but it's discouraged if you have access to CSS instead (described in a separate step).


If you have a paragraph with a complicated arrangement of text, use the pre tag instead.

, CSS paddings or margins give direct display instructions to the browser, so the result is more consistent. It's not hard to add this even if you don't know CSS and do not have a style sheet. Here's an example that shifts the entire paragraph to the right:In the <head></head> section of your HTML document, insert the following code:<style>p.indent{ padding-left: 1.8em }</style>
""p.indent"" defines a type of paragraph (p tag) named ""indent"" (you can use any name). The rest of the code adds blank space ""padding"" to the left of these paragraphs.
Now return to the body of your HTML document. Any time you want to indent a paragraph, place it inside these tags:<p class=""indent""></p>

To adjust the amount of indentation, change the ""1.8"" number in the CSS code. Keep the ""em"" after it, which is a measure of length related to the font size."
"
Use preformatted text.,
Create line breaks.,
Define paragraphs with the p tag.",How to Insert Spaces in HTML3," Any space or ↵ Enter keystroke inside <pre></pre> tags should be displayed exactly as typed. You could use this to display code examples, poetry, or any other text in which exact spacing and line breaks are important.The main downside to preformatted text is the width. Unlike normal HTML, it will not resize to match the user's window size., The <br> tag ends the current line of text. You can create blank lines from multiple br tags. This is a fine approach for novice HTML students, but this kind of forced HTML styling is discouraged once you've learned CSS.

, The <p></p> tag around text defines a paragraph. Most browsers will separate paragraphs by a single blank line, but you cannot guarantee a precise style."

Turn an image into a link.",How to Link Within a Page Using HTML," The ""anchor"" element <a></a> defines a place on the page that you can link to. Anything inside the <a> and </a> tags, typically text or an image, can be the destination of the link.

, Although it is valid HTML to leave the anchor element empty, some browsers will fail to find it if there's nothing between the <a> and </a> tags.Simply type in the text you would like to link to:


<a>My Lasagna Recipe</a>
The a tag does not typically change the style of the text.In this example, ""My Lasagna Recipe"" will appear as ordinary text.

, The id attribute gives the anchor a unique identifier so you can link to it. Place it inside the <a> tag as follows:


<a id=""anchor-name-1"">My Lasagna Recipe</a>

, The example above used ""anchor-name-1,"" but it's best to give your anchors a descriptive value, such as ""lasagna"" in this case. This value must be unique to this id. If another id in the same document has the same value, the browser cannot identify the single anchor you're trying to link to.


In HTML4, the value must begin with a letter. Can use letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, colons, and periods.In HTML5, you can use any character except for spaces.Be careful with your cases. ""Polish"" and ""polish"" are considered the same value, and should not appear in the same document., You don't need to use the <a> tag every time you want to create an anchor. The id attribute can actually go into any HTML element.All modern browsers (going back quite a while) should be able to interpret this. Here are a few examples:


Anchor in a header: <h2 id=""biblio"">Bibliography</h2>
Anchor in an image: <img id=""logo"" src=""/images/logo.png"" />
Anchor in a paragraph: <p id=""introparagraph"">(introductory paragraph)</p>
Remember that each id can only appear once per page.

, This is similar to any link, using the <a href="" ""> </a> format. However, instead of a URL as the value of the href attribute, use the # symbol followed by the anchor value. To link to the lasagna recipe in the example above, you would type:


<a href=""#lasagna"">Click here to see my lasagna recipe.</a>
Use exactly the same case as you did when creating the anchor. Some browsers will not recognize ""#Lasagna"" as a link to ""lasagna."", You can also link to your anchor from any other website. Just include the URL followed by # and the anchor value. Here are a couple examples:


Linking from another page in the same domain:
<a href=""recipes.html#lasagna"">Go to my recipes page to see my lasagna recipe.</a>
Linking from anywhere:
<a href=""http:Check out my friend's site with a lasagna recipe.</a>

, As with an ordinary URL, you can link to an anchor using an image:


<a href=""#lasagna""><img src=""chickenlasagna.png"" /></a>

, After the last line of text before the rule, make sure to insert a carriage return between the lines. Consider using either the <br> HTML tag or <br/> XHTML tag to each item into their own single line.This is a single break. - like pressing ↵ Enter.

Use the style attribute if you're only applying the CSS to one page.,
Create a separate file for CSS alone then link it to the HTML, if you plan on applying CSS to multiple pages.,
Add properties and values to change something specific in your file.,
Learn and use the basic units.,
Don't forget to make your CSS pop with color!,
Remember to make your web page stand out with CSS font styles and sizes.,
Experiment with some basic adjustments.,
Put them all together by saving the files.",How to Include CSS Within HTML Web Pages," The easiest way to incorporate CSS into the coding is by using the 'style' attribute. You can write this between the 'head' tags; OR by inserting the attribute between the HTML codes themselves. This is called 'embedding' or 'internal styles'.;
, This process is called 'external linking' or 'internal styles'. This is another method for applying CSS attributes. This will make it easier for you to edit and manage your files. By separating your files from HTML, this will reduce the amount of work you need to do in the future. But if you just want to edit a few pages, then simply insert the codes within the tags themselves as previously mentioned.

, 'Properties' are words that refer to a web element (such as color or font size) being altered. 'Values' are exact descriptions of how the properties should be (such as numerical values for font size, and color names). Properties are enclosed in curly brackets, whereas values are followed by a colon.

, There are several values for CSS, but there are general units you will want to use for basic purposes. These are: px (for pixels); em (for font size); and % (for specifying width and height percentages). Use '0' if you don't want to state a value for an element.

, You can use names (orange, black, navy, green, etc.), RGB values (ranging from 0 to 255), or hex codes (#ff0000). Using hex codes actually gives you more control over the exact shade you want. That's because the last number in the six-digit hex code is responsible for the precise color.

, There are generally three types of font families: Verdana, Times New Roman, and Arial. These are the safest fonts to use because most computers and browsers have them. However, the great thing about CSS is that you can add up to three different fonts. So if the first choice is not available on a user's computer, it will automatically go to the next one in line. Separate your choices using commas.

, For CSS beginners, you can add margins, borders, and padding for a clean look. A 'margin' is used outside of an element (such as images or text); while 'padding' is the space inside the element. As stated above, you can use px units to specify for border, margin, and padding properties. You can even make them dashed, filled with color, solid, grooved, or dotted.

, If you saved a separate file for CSS, link it by using the <link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css' type='text/css' /> command.

Open the code for your webpage and find your link.,
Look up the appropriate hex color code.,
Adjust your code.,
Use the ""find"" function to verify your code worked.",How to Hide a Link in HTML1," By going into the code you have written for your webpage, you can find the link you've written into the code and change all its color values to match your background. In doing this, you'll effectively render your link invisible against your background color.;
, HTML, CSS, and other coding languages use six digit, three-byte hexadecimal code to represent color.You'll need to find the hex code for the color that matches your background, but a few common hex codes are as follows:


White: FFFFFF
Black: 000000
Gray: 808080
Light Gray: D3D3D3
Blue: 0000FF
Beige: F5F5DC

, Once you have found the link you want to hide in your webpage code and know your hex color code, you can begin changing the color of your link. To do so, use the following code, inserting the link you want hidden and your hex color code where appropriate:<style>
a:link.com {
color: #(insert hex color code here);
}
a:active {
color: #(insert hex color code here);
}
a:visited {
color: #(insert hex color code here);
}
a:hover {
color: #(insert hex color code here);
}
</style>

, Though your link is now effectively hidden, you and other users will still be able to locate the link using the ""find"" feature in your browser. Whether your link is normal, visited, active, or being hovered over by a cursor, your link should now be invisible.


The ""find"" function can be activated in most browsers by pressing Ctrl+F.

"
"
Add a class or ID attribute to your link.,
Create a CSS rule for your class or ID.,
Change the ""display"" or ""visibility"".,
Double check the correctness of your code.",How to Hide a Link in HTML2," You can do this by including additional information in your link tag. Find your link tag and include the appropriate code for either your ID or class. Your code should look like:


class=Link.com
id=Link.com, You can reference the name you've created by using a ""."" for classes or the ""#"" symbol for your ID. The code of this should look similar to:


Classes: .Link.com
IDs: #Link.com

, Both of these features will have the effect of hiding your link, but each function hides the link in a different way. By changing the display feature to ""none"", you will remove the link from the page layout.This may cause other elements of your page to move if they define their position in reference to your link. Changing your visibility to ""hidden"" will hide the link without influencing the page layout.Your code for this stage should simply look like:


display: none
visibility: hidden

, Incorrect code can cause significant errors in your webpage or change important elements of your design. Your final HTML and CSS code should look like:



HTML Code:
<a href=Link.com
class=Link.com>Link</a>

CSS Code:
.Link.com {
display: none;
}

Be patient.",How to Be Tumblr Famous," You want to pick a username that people remember, so try to avoid using a bunch of numbers (like rockergurl555666.tumblr.com) because people won't remember it, or be intrigued by it.


If you can, pick a clever or odd username that people will want to ask you about, or that link to the theme you want for your tumblr (if it's a fandom blog about Teen Wolf, use something that refers to your part in the fandom ) or if you interested in mythology choose a mythology type username (especially something that is lesser known, because there is less likelihood that someone has already taken that username).;
, This is a many-pronged step, because you'll need to pick a specific theme for your Tumblr (i.e. how the blog looks) as well as what you want your Tumblr to specifically focus on.


You can build your own custom Tumblr theme, if you want to be really unique, but you have to know how to code html. Try to make one that corresponds to the overall content theme of your Tumblr. If it's good enough, or interesting enough, people might want to use it themselves. You can make it possible for people to use your theme, if you want.
For the theme of your blog think back to your username. Are you most interested in a fandom blog, an art blog, a fashion blog, a social justice blog? Having a personal blog is fine, but you won't collect as many followers as you will with a theme-specific Tumblr.

, Reposting is basically considered to be stealing, since you're uploading the original content of someone else, while reblogging shows where the original post came from, usually linking back to the artist, .gif maker, or text post.


Reposting is very bad form, so if you're uploading content make sure that it's content that's original to you. Especially if you get to be Tumblr famous, the repost will probably get back to the original creator.
Don't repost stuff from weheartit, because most of their content has been stolen from the original creators and that sort of behavior won't make you terribly popular.

, Tagging your posts properly is a great way to get likes and reblogs and have people take notice of the things that you're posting on your Tumblr. If you tag your posts, people who follow those particular tags will see the post. If they're interested they might like it or reblog it and if your blog has similar content they may even start following you.


You can use multiple tags and they work in the following ways: if you have a lot of similar content on your Tumblr, you can make specific tags for it and reuse those each post (for example, if you post a lot of Star Trek: The Original Series, you could have a specific tag you use for that). If there's a holiday coming up a lot of people tag for that (for example, Halloween).
Remember to be careful while tagging. If you are interested in a particular ship (relationship between two characters, typically romantic) and there's a rival ship (a pairing that puts one of the characters from your ship with a different character), don't start writing posts about how much you hate that pairing and then tag it with that tag. You will not make friends and gain followers with that method.

, Following basically means that you follow a Tumblr. You can be in a mutual follow with someone, meaning that they follow you and you follow them, or you can follow someone and they don't follow you, or someone follows you and you don't follow them. (Some popular blogs- brohaydo.tumblr.com , stupid-galaxies.tumblr.com)


People who tend to have lots of followers, don't typically follow you back the second you follow them. That's okay. If you get to know them, interact and talk with them, they'll be more likely to follow you.
Follow people whose content is similar to yours, or who are part of the niche area you've chosen. You'll be more likely to get into the niche and start recognising the big names in it.

, Take a look at posts of yours that get more likes than other ones and lean towards posts that are in a similar fashion to those that are more popular than some of your others.

, While some personal Tumblrs do end up getting famous, they're usually the ones of people who are already famous like authors, actors, or comic artists. Even some popular fanfiction writers can become popular based on their fanfiction writing and still maintain a heavily followed personal blog (although they do tend to reblog and post things about specific fandoms).


Think about your interests: you can blog about things like dance, photography, art, writing, social justice, various fandoms (books, movies, t.v. shows). These are all very different parts of Tumblr, so you'll need to choose which you're going to go for, if you want to be famous on the website.
Some examples of Tumblrs that have gotten incredibly popular: medievalpoc.tumblr.com, venushowell.tumblr.com, omgthatdress.tumblr.com, oldloves.tumblr.com, compendiously.tumblr.com, twitterthecomic.tumblr.com, clipart.tumblr.com You'll notice that Tumblrs like these have one specific theme and tend to generate their own content (so that other people reblog them).

, Look around at the people in your niche and see who has lots of followers and who gets reblogged all the time. Check out what their Tumblr theme is like? How do they interact with followers?


Check out the posts they make. Are there lots of text posts (with things like social justice rants, or meta on a t.v. show, or poetry)? Do they share personal things? Are they funny (humor is something that can elevate you to popularity)? If they are writing text posts, are they long and rambling or short and to the point? It really depends on your niche, what kinds of posts are most sought after.
Do they make or post lots of .gifs? What is the quality of the .gifs? Do they link t.v. scenes with popular quotes?
See if they mix things up with pictures. Check out the quality of the images, and how the aesthetic matches their Tumblr. Do they post many pictures of themselves, or not at all?
Pay attention to your own posts that your followers are interested in, which posts are liked and reblogged the most. You can generate more content like those and will probably start accumulating more followers.

, You especially want to find the people who are famous in your niche. Don't just ask them to promote you to their followers, ask them questions and engage with them on a more personal level. A lot of times Tumblr famous people will post the little surveys that go around Tumblr asking about things like favorite fictional character, first kiss, food they eat most often. This is a good way of getting to know them and allowing them to get to know you.


Check their FAQ's page first (this is their frequently asked questions) to see what sort of behavior is appropriate. They may not like having people ask for promos (and never make someone feel like that's the only reason you're contacting them) and what sort of questions they're tired of getting asked.
Once you've gotten on a friendly basis with them, maybe drop a line asking if they would check out some aspect of your blog and promote it to their followers. It's especially good if you have a specific thing in mind (like you're writing a fanfiction, or poetry, or you've just started trying out a new fashion look). If you're polite and specific about it, they probably won't mind helping you out.

, Now these are hard to do well, but they can help you gain more followers and more recognition, but they can also irritate people, so they are to be used carefully. Basically, getting a promo means having someone promote your Tumblr on their Tumblr, and you can do a mutual promoting, etc. What you really want is to have someone who has a lot of followers in your niche do the promoting.


A promo for promo (p4p) is basically where you promote someone on your blog and they promote you on their blog. The nice thing about this way is that your followers and their followers only are seeing one blog and not having to look through a list of promotions. Of course, if the person you're promoting with doesn't have that many followers, you're not going to get much success out of it.
A double promo is basically a regular promo, only with two people running the show. If you're following both of them, then you have the chance to get promoted by both of them, which can be good because it reaches a greater number of potential followers.
Solo promo is where you're the only one getting promoted. This can come when you're friends with one of the more Tumblr famous people, who talks about you on their blog, or recommends you to their followers.

, One of the keys to getting to be a Tumblr famous person is to have a blog that is original. It sounds clichéd, but it's actually true. The posts that spread around Tumblr like wildfire are the ones that are original, therefore everyone wants to reblog what they said, or the art they made, etc. You'll need to come up with your own original posts, and they can be anything that has to do with your niche subject.


You can make original text posts. This means writing meta about t.v. shows or books, if that's your niche, or dissecting bad literature. It means putting your opinions and your ideas out there for people to see. That may seem scary, but, even if people don't agree with your ideas, they'll still be engaging you and then other people will see and be intrigued. (This is not to say that you should go around making racists or sexist, etc. comments and then say ""but that's just my opinion;"" be polite.)
Learn to make your own .gifs, especially if you're in fandom. Then people will be interested in reblogging your work, rather than you only reblogging the work of other people. In fact, people might even ask you to make .gifs, if you're good enough.
Post your own artwork, whatever it is: drawing, photography, creative writing (fanfiction counts). It will get your artwork out there and make sure that your Tumblr has lots of original content.

, Consistency is another key to being Tumblr famous. Even when the famous folks aren't around to blog, they usually have set up a queue, which means that the blog continues publishing content even when the blogger isn't there.


Make sure that you respond to people, particularly since the more people you talk to on Tumblr the more likely you'll get steadily more popular and have more followers.

, There really is no way to get Tumblr famous overnight, except by accident (people have had a rather insignificant text post take off like wildfire around the site, but that's as likely as getting struck by lightning). Forge relationships with people and you'll find that you'll start getting more and more followers.


Remember that a lot of people who are Tumblr famous now have been on Tumblr for several years and have taken time to accumulate followers and get accustomed to how things work.

Custom Layout will let you create a custom page on your Tumblr, but without your Tumblr theme, so you have to input all the HTML yourself. You can generally copy and paste HTML from a full-featured HTML editor like Dreamworks.

Redirect will create a redirect to a specified Web site, instead of being an actual page on your Tumblr. For example, you could show some of your favorite Web sites on your Tumblr homepage using some of these.

, Each layout type will have slightly different input fields.



Page URL (all layouts). The page URL will be tagged at the end of your standard URL, and is the address that people will have to type into the address bar to access your page. Do not use spaces when creating this URL.

If there is no forward slash symbol, the code between the angle brackets will remain true. If there is a forward slash after the first angle bracket, the code will then end (also known as the ""ender"").;
, Always begin with <html>. This tag will tell your computer that you are creating a web page. It will always be the first tag you use.

, There are two parts to the format for HTML. First one being the head, which is the tag itself. HTML will always begin and end with a tag. Then there is the body, the information between the tags.

, Head tags are the container for all head elements. The tag <head> is the heading of the document. Your title comes after your head tag, and will inform viewers what your webpage is about.


Note that this will show only in the webpage's tab; it will not appear on your website.

, The body of the page will begin when you enter the <body> tag. It will end when you enter </body>. There are many ways to customize your body paragraphs.

, Change the font, size, and color of your body paragraph by entering the code in red above. You can add any preferred font name, size, and color in-between the quotations and everything in-between and will be the font type, size, and color that you choose.

, You can accomplish this with the use of the tags on the chart above.

, You can change the headings of your text with the use of the tags on the chart above. ""H1"" will be the largest and ""H6"" will be the smallest.


Note: Keep in mind that there is a difference between the tags <""head""> and <""H1"">

, You can insert an image using the tag <IMG SRC: ""example.jpg"" WIDTH=""70"" HEIGHT ""52""> with the closing tag </img>. The image source (URL) should be in jpeg format and you can adjust the width and height to your own preference. You can make your adjustments where the text is red.

, The tag < p > will create a line break and a space between the lines. You can use this tag to separate different text bodies within your webpage.

, Special characters can be used to make your webpage more organized. Refer to the chart above.

, It is very important that you make sure all your tags are followed by closed tags. That will make sure there are no errors in your webpage.

, Two things must be done to finish up your webpage and have it working correctly. You need to save it with file name and an extension of .html. Also, make sure you choose ""all files"", ""text"", or ""web page"" (Mac Users) under the file type/format drop box. Your webpage will not work correctly if you do not follow both of these steps.

Metadata elements also have specific formats, like key fields for text files, XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) or Exif (Exchangeable image file format) formats for visuals, and other sorts of common presentations. Knowing more about these will help you use metadata the right way.;
, In order to edit or change metadata, you will need to make sure that you have access to it. This can mean having the right administrative clearance, having network connections to where files are kept, or even just knowing how to unlock compressed folders or restricted formats.


Get your clearance, orienting file directions and passwords. For some common kinds of jobs editing metadata, individuals will need specific access. For example, to edit text page metadata in a content management system (CMS) like Joomla, you will need to have the right password to access the web site's back end. Staffers who are ordered to edit metadata will need these virtual keys from management before editing can take place.

, For web page metadata, which is one of the most commonly edited kinds, you will need to find the right amending tags for the data, usually in the margins of the page that shows the core web page content.

, When you have located the actual text or icon metadata, click into the fields and edit as needed.

, This step is critical to making any edits to metadata. Most data handling programs require specific save commands in order to preserve any edits that a user does while in the system. Disregard this rule, and you may find that your changes are simply not saved.

, Whether it's straight text (useful for names and addresses) or a password (for pages that require setup information), or yes/no checkboxes, or even a drop-down list of reasons (and lots of other types too), you'll never run out of items or reasons to put stuff on the page. Set the different types below for additional information to add to the page.

Open your HTML document in your preferred text editor.,
Open the <form> element.,
Add the “action=” attribute to the <form> tag.,
Decide how the form data will be sent.,
Create a text box using <input type=”text” />.,
Create a password box.,
Add radio buttons for options.,
Learn more advanced form options.,
Create a Submit <button>.,
Type </form> at the end of the form.,
Upload your document to your web server.",How to Create HTML Forms," The content of an HTML form must be typed within the <form> and </form> tags. These tags act as a container for your form, like other container tags like <div></div> and <table></table>You can use CSS or HTML inside the <form></form> tags to make your form look the way you want.;
, To start your form, scroll to the location in your file where the form should begin and type <form> on its own line. This tag signifies the beginning of your form.

, This tells the <form> tag what to do with the form data. You’ll define this by adding action=”path_to_script” to the <form> tag.


For example: <form action=”/cgi-bin/myformscript.pl”> (if the script that will parse the form data is located in a directory on your server called “cgi-bin”).
If the script is on another server: <form action=”https:

To send the form data to an email address (not a script):<form action=”mailto:you@yourdomain.com” enctype=”text/plain”>


, Now that you’ve defined where the form data will be sent, you must decide whether your form will “GET” or “POST” the data. Then, you will add either “GET” or “POST” as the method attribute inside the <form> tag.Use method=”get” to request data from a resource. You should only use GET to retrieve data. Never use GET with sensitive information like passwords or social security numbers.
Use method=”post” to submit data to be processed. Use this if the form data is sensitive, such as for passwords or credit card numbers.
The end result should follow this format: <form action=”/cgi-bin/myformscript.pl” method=”post”>


, You can add a blank box in which your visitors can type their names, comments, or anything else you may need. Start this on a new line after the <form> tag.


For example, First Name: <input type=”text” id=”name” /> creates a text box prefaced by “First Name:” so users know what to type into the box.
Change the “id=” value (“name” in the example) to match what you’re doing with the data. If the data is sent to a script, this value should correspond with something in the script.

, If your script calls for a user to enter a password, you’ll add another <input />, this time with the “type” attribute set to “password.”


On a new line, type Password: <input type=”password” name=”password” />


, If you’d like visitors to choose from a list of items, create a list of options with radio buttons. To do this, you’ll use the <input /> tag with the “type” attribute set to “radio”.


To create a radio buttons to select either “Dog” or “Cat”:

<input type=”radio” name=”pets” value=”dog” /> Dog
<input type=”radio” name=”pets” value=”cat” /> Cat


A group of radio buttons should all have the same “name” attribute.

, There are so many types of inputs and lists you can include in your form. A great way to expand your HTML form knowledge is to browse W3school’s HTML Forms site. Additionally, there are many helpful wikiHows articles to walk you through setting up items like selectable lists, reset/clear buttons, and check boxes.

, Once your visitor fills out the form, they’ll need to submit it by clicking a submit button. Here’s an example:<button type=""submit"">Send your message</button>
Replace “Send your message” with the text you want to appear on the button.

, This tag indicates that the form is over. Remember, all form content must be inside <form> and </form>.

, Now that you’ve added a form to your HTML document, upload it to your web server and give it a test run!

To see what it looks like, go into Internet Explorer, navigate to any website and right-click on the web-page selecting ""View Source"". You will see a page of code, and that is HTML. That code is what your browser sees and interprets into a human friendly web-page.


In Google Chrome press F12.
In Mozilla Firefox, press Ctrl + U to view the page's source code.
In Safari, select View→View Source (or Option + Command + U).
In Internet Explorer, the VIEW menu option is ""source"".

, If you don't, you'll likely get overwhelmed by the syntax and the script languages.


It's important to remember that you'll be writing your information between an opening HTML tag and a closing HTML tag. An opening tag looks like this: <___> . A closing tag looks like this: </___> . Eventually, the ___ is replaced with a code.

, and click ""Notepad."" It is a lot easier if you use Notepad++ once you choose the HTML language, everything you write will be automatically connected with different colors - that way it will be a lot easier to correct possible mistakes.

, On the first line, type <!DOCTYPE>, this should always be the first tag in your code. On the second line add <html>. It is the second tag you write that tells the computer you're starting a web-page. It will also be closed last, so at the end of the document, close it off by typing this: </html>. This ends the web page.

,, A title is important because it gives your users an idea on what the page is all about. Also, when users bookmark your site, that title is all they will see in their bookmark list. The title for HTML code is <title>. Close it off at the end of your title by writing </title> The title is going to show on the tab, don't expect it to be the title of the actual website.

, Type <body> to open the body tag. Then close the body tag by typing </body>. The bulk of the information for your web-page goes between <body> and </body>.


To give your web-page a background color, you can add a style to the body. To add a background color, add this tag <body style=""background-color:silver"">. You can try a different color or even a hex code. The words in the quotation marks are known as ""attributes."" They must be surrounded by quotation marks!

<strong>Use the strong tag</strong>.,
Use heading tags instead when appropriate.,
<b>Use the b tag as a last resort</b>.",How to Create Bold Text With HTML1," In HTML5, the preferred standard, the strong tag is recommended for important text. This is almost always displayed as bold text in browsers.


Place the text you want bolded in between these tags: <strong>bold text here</strong>.;
, ""Headings"" are usually placed at the top of the web page or at the beginning of a new section. Usually, headings are displayed as bold and larger than the regular font, but this can vary. There are six different heading tags, from <h1> to <h6>. Follow these guidelines when using them:


The h1 tag, written <h1>Your Heading Here</h1> is the most important heading, typically the largest text at the top of the page.
<h2>The h2 tag</h2> is for the second most important heading, and so on down to <h6>h6, the smallest</h6>.
Use these sparingly, only to organize your page.Users should be able to skim the headings quickly and find the topic they're looking for.
When creating subheadings, move down just one level at a time. In other words, don't skip from <h1> to <h3>. This helps the HTML page preserve its formatting when transferred to another format., The <b> tag is still supported in HTML5, but <strong> is preferred in most situations. Use the <b> tag only when the text should be bolded for stylistic reasons, not to add emphasis. Examples include key words or vocabulary words in a passage, or product names in a review.As with most tags, <b>place the affected text between a start tag and an end tag</b>.

Understand when to use CSS.,
Add a <span> tag to your text.,
Add the style attribute.,
Add the font-weight property.,
Add the bold value.,
Experiment with other values.",How to Create Bold Text With HTML2," CSS is a more powerful and consistent way to style your web page. This makes it the ideal way to determine how your page looks, while HTML is designed to determine what your page means. It's completely fine to use HTML tags when you want to emphasize important text, but CSS will give you more close control over the visual appearance of your bold text.


Try opening a basic HTML page with different browsers, and you might notice differences in the display. CSS tells the browser exactly how to display text altered by a given tag, to minimize the amount of variation.

, If you don't know CSS yet, using ""inline CSS"" is a good way to get started. While you can use this to alter tags such as <p> or <h1>, sometimes you'll want to change text that's not already between tags.In this case, place the text between <span></span> tags. This has no effect on its own, but gives us something to work with. Here's the example we'll be using:


<span>I learned how to make this text bold with inline CSS.</span>

, HTML attributes are written directly in the tag, inside the < >brackets. The style attribute is necessary to insert CSS into the HTML tag, so we'll insert style= into the span tag:


<span style=>I learned how to make this text bold with inline CSS.</span>
There's no reason to add the style attribute without specifying any styles. We're just taking this one step at a time to make it easy to follow.

, CSS properties are added as part of the style attribute. In our case, we'll use the font-weight property, which determines how thick to draw the font. This single property can be used to display bold (extra-thick) text, thin text, or even specify that the text should be displayed with normal thickness. Add ""font-weight: "" after the = sign, like this:


<span style=""font-weight: "">I learned how to make this text bold with inline CSS.</span>
Again, this is unfinished and won't do anything by itself.
Don't forget the quotation marks before and after font-weight:.

, The only thing we need to do now is add a value for font-weight, between the font-weight: and the final quotation mark. There are quite a few options for different amounts of ""boldness,"" but the value bold is the easiest to use :<span style=""font-weight:bold"">I learned how to make this text bold with inline CSS.</span>

, CSS gives you many more options than HTML, so you don't need to feel constricted. Here are several alternatives to the ""bold"" value:<span style=""font-weight:bolder"">""Bolder"" text will always be thicker than the parent element.</span> For example, if you make an entire paragraph ""bold,"" then use ""bolder"" on an individual sentence inside that paragraph, it will be even thicker.
<span style=""font-weight:normal"">""Normal"" text will be displayed as normal even if the span is inside a bold tag.</span>
<span style=""font-weight:900"">You can instead use a number from 100 to 900 to specify thickness. 400 is normal text, while bold text uses a thickness of 700 by default.</span>"

Create your navigation section.,
Give each section a class attribute.,
Add a list of menu items.,
Insert links.,
Create sub-lists for the dropdown items.,
Open your CSS stylesheet.,
Add clearfix code.,
Create the basic layout.,
Make dropdown items appear on hover.,
Indicate the dropdown menu with an arrow.,
Adjust padding, background, and other properties.",How to Create a Dropdown Menu in HTML and CSS," Typically, you would choose <nav> for the sitewide navigation bar, <header> for smaller, page-specific link sections, or <div> if no other option seems to fit.Put this inside a <div> element, so you can style the container as well as the menu itself.


<div>
   <nav>
   </nav>
</div>;
, We'll use the class attribute later, to style these elements using CSS. Give a separate class attribute for the container and for the menu.


<div class=""nav-wrapper"">
   <nav class=""nav-menu"">
   </nav>
</div>

, The unordered list (<ul>) contains the top menu items (list items <li>), which the user will hover over to see the drop down menus. Add the ""clearfix"" class to your list element; we'll return to this later in the CSS spreadsheet.<div class=""nav-wrapper"">
   <nav class=""nav-menu"">
      <ul class=""clearfix"">

         <li>Home</li>

         <li>Contributors

         </li>

         <li>Contact Us

         </li>

      </ul>

   </nav>
</div>

, If these top-level menu items also link to their own pages, insert the links now. Even if they do not link anywhere, link to a nonexistent anchor (such as ""#!""), so the user's cursor changes appearance. In this example, Contact Us does not lead anywhere, but the other two menu items do:


<div class=""nav-wrapper"">
   <nav class=""nav-menu"">
      <ul class=""clearfix"">
         <li><a href=""/"">Home</a></li>
         <li><a href=""/Contributors"">Contributors</a>

         </li>
         <li><a href=""#!"">Contact Us</a>

         </li>
      </ul>
   </nav>
</div>

, After styling is complete, these lists will become the drop down menu. Nest the list inside the list item the user will hover over. Include a class attribute and link, as before.


<div class=""nav-wrapper"">
   <nav class=""nav-menu"">
      <ul class=""clearfix"">
         <li><a href=""/"">Home</a></li>
         <li><a href=""/Contributors"">Contributors</a>
         <ul class=""sub-menu"">

            <li><a href=""/jordan"">Michael Jordan</a></li>

            <li><a href=""/hawking"">Stephen Hawking</a></li>

         </ul>

         </li>
         <li><a href=""#!"">Contact Us</a>
         <ul class=""sub-menu"">

            <li><a href=""mailto:bugsupport@company.com"">Report a Bug</a></li>

            <li><a href=""/support"">Customer Support</a></li>

         </ul>

         </li>
      </ul>
   </nav>
</div>

, Link the CSS stylesheet in the head section of your HTML document, if you haven't already. This article does not cover CSS basics, such as setting a font and background color.

, Remember the ""clearfix"" class you added to the menu list? Normally, the elements on the dropdown menu will have a clear background, and might shove other elements around. A quick CSS adjustment fixes this problem. Here's a short and sweet solution, although it will not support Internet Explorer 7 and earlier:.clearfix:after {
content: """";
display: table;
}

, This code will arrange your menu across the top of the page, and hide the dropdown elements. This is intentionally bare-bones to focus on the relevant code. You can spruce it up later with additional CSS properties, such as padding and margin.


.nav-wrapper {
   width:100%;
   background: #999;
}
 
.nav-menu {
   position:relative;
   display:inline-block;
}
 
.nav-menu li {
   display: inline;
   list-style-type: none;
}
 
.sub-menu {
   position:absolute;
   display:none;
   background: #ccc;
}

, The elements in the dropdown list are currently set not to display. Here's how to make an entire sub-list appears when you hover over its parent:


.nav-menu ul li:hover > ul {
   display:inline-block;
}

Note — If your dropdown menu items lead to additional (flyout) menus, any properties you add here will affect them all. If you'd like to style the first level of dropdown menus only, use "".nav-menu > ul"" instead, Web designers typically show that an element opens a dropdown menu with a downward-pointing arrow. This code will add that arrow to each element in your menu:.nav-menu > ul > li:after {
   content: ""\25BC""; /*escaped unicode for the down arrow*/
   font-size: .5em;
   display: inline;
   position: relative;
   }
Note — Make adjustments to the arrow's position using the top, bottom, right, or left properties.
Note — If not all of your menu items contain dropdowns, don't style the entire nav-menu class. Instead, add another class (such as dropdown) to each HTML li element where you'd like an arrow. Refer to that class instead in the code above.

, Your menu should now be functional, but it could use a beauty treatment. If you are not familiar with basic CSS properties learn more here. Use these properties to further change the appearance and positioning of each class of element.

Click here for an explanation of how to familiarize yourself with this process, or read on to learn what each line of text is doing in the code you'll be using to make your calculator.



html: This piece of syntax tells the rest of the document what language is being used in the code. In coding, a number of languages used to code, and <html> tells the rest of the document that it will be in - you guessed it! - html.head: Tells the document that everything beneath it is data about data, also known as ""metadata"". The <head> command is usually used to define stylistic elements of a document, such as titles, headings, and so on. Think of it as an umbrella under which the rest of the code is defined.title: This is where you will name the title of your document. This attribute is used to define what the title of the document will be when opened in an html browser.

body bgcolor= ""#"": This attribute sets the color of the code's background and body. The number in this set of quotes that appears after # corresponds to a predetermined color.


text= """": The word in this set of quotes sets the color of the text on the document.

form name="""": This attribute specifies the name of a form, which is used to build the structure of what comes after it based on what Javascript knows that form name to mean. For example, the form name we will be using is calculator, which will create a specific structure to the document.input type="""": This is where the action happens. The ""input type"" attribute tells the document what sort of text the values in the rest of the brackets are. For example, they could be text, a password, a button (as it will be for a calculator), and so on.value="""": This command tells the document what will be contained in the input type specified above. For a calculator, these show up as our numbers (1-9) and operations (+,-,*,/,=).onClick="""": This syntax describes an event, which tells the document that something should occur when the button is clicked. For a calculator, we want the text that displays in each button to by understood as such. So, for the ""6"" button, we'll put document.calculator.ans.value+='6' between the quotes.br: this tag initiates a line break in the document, so that whatever comes after it will appear a line below whatever came before it./form, /body, and /html: these commands tell the document that the corresponding commands that were initiated earlier in the document are now ending.;

Make sure there are no spaces in the comment tags. For example < !-- will not activate the comment function. Inside the tags, you can have as many spaces as you'd like.;
, Your comments can span multiple lines, which is useful for explaining complex code, or for blocking off large pieces of code.

Determine how much you are willing to pay.,
Think about what features and style you want.,
Search for editors.,
Narrow the list down by price, features etc.,
Choose an editor from the last items you have on your list.

,
Download and install the program.",How to Choose an HTML Editor," This is important to consider. Some people prefer a free HTML editor. Some good free editors are Microsoft Visual Web Developer, Kompozer and SeaMonkey. Microsoft Expression Web is now available for free, too, but it has been abandoned and is no longer supported by Microsoft. Dreamweaver is preferred by many people and is often used in larger corporate environments who are willing to spend a few hundred dollars per license.;
, Ask yourself: ""What do I really need in my HTML editor? What kind of site am I building?"" Make a list of features you need. For instance, if you use flash a lot in your site, get an HTML editor that allows you to put flash on your websites. If you need a simple site, get a simple HTML editor. You might say ""But...the other one has more features!"" It might. But if there are thousands of features you don't need, you might not be able to access the ones you need as quickly. One more thing: look for HTML editor that has HTML mode. This is where you get to view the source of the HTML, edit it, etc. Most HTML editors have this, but you may come across one or two that don't.


What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) capabilities, auto-insertion (meaning that the program automatically inserts closing tags and brackets), and the ability to publish directly to the server are great to have, regardless of what type of website you're building.

, To get some ideas, look at the search results for ""best html editors"". Read the opinions on which editors are best. You can also go to download sites such as Download.com and type in 'HTML editors'. You should see hundreds of editors. Go through the pages. It may take a long time, but it can be worth it. While you are doing all this, this make notes about editors you really like (and that you can afford). Remember, if you see an HTML editor that is way above your price range, don't get it. Chances are there is one out there you can afford that will suit your needs.


Look at the system requirements of any editor. What operating systems is it compatible with? Do you have enough RAM to accommodate the program? How much space does it require on the hard drive?






Read what ordinary users have to say about it on the reviews. Is it glitchy, hard to navigate, and memory consuming (some programs lie, despite what they say the system requirements are). Is it smooth and easy to navigate?

, This is where that list from Step 1 comes in handy. Choose editors with the most needed features and the lowest price (if it is not free). Cut your list down to four or five HTML editors. Cut it down to a number from between one and three.

,, Most modern programs have an easy installation wizard to guide you. Some programs, like Kompozer, don't require installation at all.

Open your HTML file.,
Place your cursor inside the <head> tag.,
Type <style> to create an internal stylesheet.,
Type the element you want to change the text color for.,
Type the color: attribute into the element selector.,
Type in a color for the text.,
Add other selectors to change the color of various elements.,
Define a CSS class instead of changing an element.",How to Change Text Color in HTML1," The best way to change the color of your text is by using CSS. The old HTML attribute is no longer supported in HTML5. The preferred method is to use CSS to define the style of your elements.


This method will also work with external stylesheets (separate CSS files). The examples below are for an HTML file using an internal stylesheet.;
, You'll be defining your styles inside this tag if you're using an internal stylesheet.

, When the <style> tag is in the <head> tag, the CSS inside the <style> tag will be applied to any applicable elements on that page. When you're finished, the beginning of your HTML file should look something like this:<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
 
</style>
</head>




, You'll be using the <style> section to define the look of the different elements on your page. So for example, to change the style of all the body text on your page, type the following:





<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
 
}
</style>
</head>




, The color: attribute will tell the page what text color to use for that element. In this example, it will change the text color of all body text, which is the default element for all text on your page:





<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
        color:
}
</style>
</head>




, There are three ways you can enter a color: the name, the hex value, or the RGB value. For example, for the color blue you could type blue, rgb(0, 0, 255), or #0000FF.





<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
        color: red;
}
</style>
</head>




, You can use the different selectors to change the color of your text for different parts of the page:





<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
        color: red;
}
h1 {
        color: #00FF00;
}
p {
        color: rgb(0,0,255)
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
 
<h1>This header will be green.</h1>
 
<p>This paragraph will be blue.</p>
 
This body text will be red.
</body>
</html>




, You can define a class and then apply it to any element you'd like throughout the page to instantly add the class style. For example, in the following file the "".redtext"" class will make any element it's applied to use red text:





<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.redtext {
        color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
 
<h1 class=""redtext"">This heading will be red</h1>
<p>This paragraph will be normal.</p>
<p class=""redtext"">This paragraph will be red</p>
 
</body>

Prepare to edit HTML web pages by learning the basics of HTML code.,
Find the text that you want to center in your web page.

,
Place the tag ""center"" in brackets before the start of the text.,
Place the tag ""/center"" in brackets after the end of the text.,
Save your web page.",How to Center Text in HTML1,"

View the various tags you can use to change the font or formatting of text. For example, a small ""b"" in a bracket is used to identify bold text. A small ""i"" is used to identify italic text. Do not include the quotation marks in your code.



 


Practice pairing tags. Most formatting tags require 2 tags, at the beginning and end of the text that you want to change. The first tag will include the letters or symbols of the tag in brackets (<>). The second tag will include a backslash before the tag. For example, you would put ""b"" in brackets at the beginning of the bolded text and ""/b"" in brackets after the bolded text.





;
,, Do not place any spaces between the tag and the text.

, Do not include any spaces.

, View it to make sure you have aligned the text properly.


If this did not change the alignment of your text, then you are using a program, like HTML5 that uses CSS instead of HTML coding. Try the second method to correctly align the text.







"

Don’t use the word “center” in your tag.,
Start a new line of code.,
Insert the image by typing <img src=”imgName.gif”.,
Specify the alignment of your image.,
Add more text.",How to Center an Image in HTML1," In HTML coding, you can center text, but you must identify image alignment with the word “middle.” An image is not a line element, so it is identified in relation to other elements.;
, Use a paragraph tag to indicate that a text line is beginning. Start your tag with <p> then write your text.

, Then include your image description by typing alt=”image description”.


The “src” section tells the web page the URL of the image.
The alt section tells the web page what it should be called.

, Type align=”middle”> This is the end of the image portion of your tag., Then, close the tag with </p>. For example, your entire tag could look like this:
<p>We’re learning about HTML. <img src=”dancingdogpicture.gif” alt=”dancing dog” align=”middle> Our example is complete. </p>

Type the color you want to change the text to.",How to Change Text Color in HTML2," You can use inline style attributes to change the style of a single element on your page. This can be useful for one or two quick changes to the style, but is not recommended for widespread use. For comprehensive style changes, use the previous method., You can use inline style attributes to change the text color of any of your elements. For example, if you want to change the text color of a specific header, find it in your file:





<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
 
<h1>This is the header you want to change</h1>
 
</body>
</html>




, Type style="""" inside the opening tag for the element you want to change:





<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
 
<h1 style="""">This is the header you want to change</h1>
 
</body>
</html>




, For example:





<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
 
<h1 style=""color:"">This is the header you want to change</h1>
 
</body>
</html>




, There are three ways you can express a color. You can type the name of the color, you can enter the RGB value, or you can enter the hex value. For example, to change the color to yellow, you could type yellow;, rgb(255,255,0);, or #FFFF00;:

,
Add the closed bracket immediately after the semi-colon.",How to Center Text in HTML2," CSS code is inserted above HTML code, because the 2 markup languages work together.

Recognize the terms body, h1, h2 and h3. These are used to indicate the text body of a web page, or the smaller, normal text. h1 is the largest heading and h2 and h3 are smaller. This is similar language to what you use in HTML to identify parts of a web page.






Use tags in parenthesis instead of brackets. You will place your CSS tag in parenthesis after the word ""body"" or ""h1."" For example, after body, you may place the following in parenthesis ""text-indent:50px;"". This instructs you to indent the text. Do not include the quotation marks in your code.







, You will be placing your CSS style codes inside the first bracket in this line of HTML code.


For example, if you wanted to change the top heading, you might find ""h1"" in brackets.







,, Save your web page.


You can also replace the word ""center"" with ""right,"" ""left"" or ""justify"" to try different alignment.

",How to Align Something in HTML1," That means, you need to add ""div"" inside the ""less than"" and ""greater than"" symbols (<>) before the first HTML tag that will have its alignment changed, and add ""/div"" inside these symbols after the last HTML tag that will have its alignment changed.;
,,


If you need to right-align the text, change the ""div"" tag to ""div style='text-align:right'"" within the ""<>"" symbols.
If you need center-align the text, change the ""div"" tag to ""div style='text-align:center'"" within the ""<>"" symbols.
If you need to justify the text, change the ""div"" tag to ""div style='text-align:justify'"" within the ""<>"" symbols.

,,


If it didn't work, then the website has specific coding in its style sheet that overrides your ""div"". Override the site style-sheet by adding the appropriate version of ""style='text-align:right'"" inside the opening tag of each element to have its alignment changed. For example, a ""p"" tag would become ""p style='text-align:right'"" within the ""<>"" symbols.

Remember to close all tags in HTML5.,
Do not assume that IDEs are a superior way of establishing a webpage and that the code created in one is not usable in another.,
Don't strain over text publishers.,
Avoid using Inline CSS or including the JavaScript in the html document.,
Use careful documentation and note taking.,
Know that variable, function, class and ID names are crucial.,
Structure the page correctly with proper tags.",How to Avoid HTML5 Website Development Mistakes," While you will simply get away with writing instead of since both work all the same, not closing the tags that need to be sealed will always create headaches in your page. The tag, if left open, a tag will leave the code in the latter useless, because the browser will then assume that the entire application melds together.;
,


This is the furthest you could get from the fact. No webpage progression IDE does anything special to the code that you write apart from most likely Dream Weaver, and as such, code prepared in one of them is fully portable and compatible with any other IDE. As a beginner though, one should simply use a text editor like Notepad++ and then run the result either through a server or a hosting service.

, Text editors are not one of the things you need to get worried about, since any decent one will get the job completed. All you need to do is write your code and save it with the accurate file format. Some text editors like Notepad++ come with syntax showcasing and can facilitate the knowledge of writing a page, but when it comes to the development, any of the solutions will do equally well if you are not addicted to the bells and whistles of a particular one.

, This is a bad idea for an experienced veteran, let alone a newcomer. Inline CSS will likely work in many cases, but once a problem arises, it can become a nightmare to identify the problem and get rid of it. Imported CSS/JavaScript, on the other hand, offers greater mobility and can help in making large scale changes a reasonably easier task. Hence the best practice is to import the files through link tags in the element and external style sheets. This allows for easy adjusting whenever necessary.

, It may seem avoidable and tiresome in the starting point, but eliminating an error can be simplified if the comment points to a particular part that does a particular thing.

, They help in realizing the code much in the same way as responses do. For, example, if your block of code does a multiplication of two numbers and you name it Category, you will never be able to correctly edit and update the code in the wanted way. All of the collaborating programmers will thank you if you use an acceptable name for parts like these.

, This can work the same as tag but it is essential to understand which one is to be used where. Once you know the difference you'll know which one should be used at a particular part of the page.

If you need the image to hang to the left, add ""style='float:left'"" to the tag, as in ""img style='float:right'"" within the ""<>"" symbols.
If you need the image to hang to the right, add ""style='float:right'"" to the tag, as in ""img style='float:right'"" within the ""<>"" symbols.
If you need the image to hang in the center, the code gets a bit more complicated. There is not ""float:center"" property, so you have to add the work-around ""style='align:center;text-align:center'"" to the tag, as in ""img style='align:center;text-align:center'"" again within the ""<>"" symbols.

Familiarize yourself with the purpose of meta tags.,
Decide what keywords you will list in your meta tags.,
Write the meta tags into your website's source code.,
Decide if you want to implement other meta tags.,
Consider augmenting your meta tags with other search engine optimization tactics.",How to Add Metatags," Meta tags are HTML tags that allow you to provide keywords relevant to your site's content that help search engines index your site. By using meta tags, you improve your site's chances of being displayed high on a list of search engine results.;
, These keywords should be relevant to your site's content. If your website is about turntable repair, you could list ""turntable repair,"" ""vinyl,"" ""turntable,"" et cetera. There are a few things to remember when choosing your keywords.


There is no limit to the amount of keywords you can list. The more you list, the better your chances of being found.
Keywords should appear in the body of your site at least once. Some search engines check your keywords against the content of your page.
It works to your advantage to use both phrases and the individual words they contain. Even if you have already listed ""turntable repair"" as a keyword, go ahead and list ""turntable"" and ""repair"" separately too.

, Meta tags should be placed inside your site's tags, anywhere after the ""title"" tag. There are 2 basic meta tags that you should implement.


The first is the keyword tag. This tag is used to list all your keywords. The syntax is fairly simple: < meta name = ""keywords"" content = ""turntable, turntable repair, vinyl, records"" >. All your keywords go in a list after the content designation.
The second is the description tag. This tag is used to index a short description of your site. The syntax is as follows: < meta name = ""description"" content = ""The best turntable repair shop in Chicago."" >. Your site's description should be placed in quotes after the content designation.

, There are many other things a meta tag can specify besides keywords and a description. Common ones are the website's author and the copyright information. Search the Internet for tips on how to fully take advantage of the more complex meta tag possibilities.

, Meta tags are part of a broader practice called search engine optimization (SEO), which helps people find your website. Explore other options for improving your visibility, such as ""pay-per-click"" marketing � paying to be ranked highly on search results.

You can name the folder anything you like, but when working with HTML, it's best to get in the habit of naming files and folders with short, single word names.;
, Put the image you'd like to use as background into the HTML folder.


If you aren't too concerned with ensuring your website will run well on older devices with slower internet connections, you should be safe in using a higher resolution image as your background. Simple images with light, repetitive patterns are also a good choice when deciding on a background image so that you can read any text on top of it.
If you don't have an image, you can download a free background image. If you download an image, put it in the HTML folder you created.

, Open a text editor, and then create a new file. Save the file as index.html.


You can use any text editor you want, even the system text editors provided by Windows, Notepad, and Mac OS X, TextEdit.
If you want to use a text editor intended for working with HTML, click here to download Atom, a text editor that works on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems.
If you're using TextEdit, before starting to write the HTML file, click the Format menu, and then click Make Plain Text. This setting will make sure the HTML file loads properly in a web browser.
Word processors, such as Microsoft Word, are not great for writing HTML, because they add invisible characters and formatting that can break an HTML file so that it doesn't display correctly in a web browser.

, Select and copy the HTML code below, and then paste it into your open index.html file.




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
 
<style>
body {
        background-image: url("" "");
} 
 
</style>
 
</head>
 
<body>
 
</body>
</html>




, In the index.html file, find the line background-image: url("" "");. Move the cursor between the parentheses, and then type the background image file name. Make sure to include the background image file extension.

When you're done, it should look like:background-image: url(""background.png"");

When you use a filename without a file path or URL, the web browser will look in the web page folder for the named image. If the file is in another folder on your file system, you'll need to add the full path to that file.,, Right-click the index.html file, and then open it in the web browser of your choice.


When the browser opens, if you don't see the image, make sure the image file name is spelled correctly in the index.html text editor window.
When the browser opens, if you see HTML code instead of the background image, your index.html file was saved as a rich text document. You may want to try editing the HTML file in a different text editor.

, In the text editor window, move the cursor between the <body> </body> tags, and then type Hello world!. Reload the browser window to see the text on top of the background image.

, HTML code is made up of open and closed tags. The <body> tag is the open body tag, and </body> is the closed body tag. Every open tag on an HTML page needs to have a closing tag for the page to display correctly.

, Every well-written HTML page should start with <!DOCTYPE html>. This tells a web browser that the HTML file is an HTML file.

, In the text editor window, move the cursor between the <body> </body> tags, and then type Hello world! . Reload the browser window to see the text on top of the background image.

, HTML code is made up of open and closed tags. The <body> tag is the open body tag, and </body> is the closed body tag. Every open tag on an HTML page needs to have a closing tag for the page to display correctly.

, The <title> tag is text that appears in the title bar of your browser window, as well as the text that shows in a browser tab.

, The <style> tag flags CSS content. Everything between the <style> tags is CSS code.

, Any text written between the <body> tags will appear as written, unless it's HTML or CSS code.

, In the text editor window, move the cursor between the <body> </body> tags, and then type ""Hello world!"". Reload the browser window to see the text on top of the background image.

, In your index.html code, the CSS code between the <style> tags tells the web browser to add a background image with a specific name to the <body> tag when the web page renders.

,





body {
        background-image: url(""background.png"");
}




, CSS styles are made up of two parts, the selector and the declaration.In the example, body is the selector andbackground-image: url(""background.png"") is the declaration.
A selector can be any HTML tag.
Declarations always go between curly braces { }.
, The CSS declaration is made up of two parts, the property and the value. Between the curly braces,background-image is the property and url(""background.png"") is the value.The property describes what is being styled and the value describes how the property is styled.
The property and value are always separated by a colon :.
CSS declarations always end in semicolons ;.

Measure speed load time after the changes have been attended.

",How to Speed Up the Load Time of Your Website," Use tools such as SiteReportCard, Google PageSpeed, GTmetrix or Pingdom.  A screen shot of Pingdom's Website Speed Test is in the image above,  These resources will provide an analysis of where the slow load problems exist on the page tested.;
, For a number of webmasters who use simplified website building platforms there are a number of infrastructure areas which can be optimized for load time, but may not accessible to a ""non-expert"".  Here are three such recommendations a Google PageSpeed analysis may suggest optimizing:


Leverage browser caching
Enable compression
Eliminate external render blocking Javascript and CSS in above the fold content There's no need to fret about what you can't do. Just focus on what is within your control.

,  Google informs these ads load faster. 

, Remove external widgets unless they add to the user's experience.

, Useful tools include getpaint.net, kraken.io, dynamicdrive.com, smush.it, all of which are free. It's a painstaking exercise especially for those with image rich sites, but well worth the effort.

, Ask yourself, if the image adds to the user's experience and if not, ask why it should be there, taking up load time.  It's faster to load one image of 200KB than to load 10 images of 20 KB each, so take care to prune images to better the visitor experience and speed up load time.

, This means reducing white space in CSS, JS and HTML code. For beginner webmasters, please take care or avoid this step if you do not understand code.

, It's best to have the main article load firstly, then third party plugins.  Consider relocating social plugins below the fold and either removing or relocating widgets such as RSS signups, Translate and Search Boxes, if pressed for opportunities to optimize load time.

Keep limits in mind.",How to Register a Domain Name," Your website will be made with a series of files, so you'll need a place to store those files. You can do it on your own computer (without a hosting service) or store them on another company's servers (with a hosting service). Most webhosting services will also be able to register a domain name for you. Choose which route you want to take and then follow the appropriate set of instructions.;
, Choose a service to host your website, or go with the service that you already have (if you inherited a website). There are many reputable ones, and you will want to choose a reputable one, but they tend to have different customer service policies and prices. Choose what's best for you.


Reputable hosting services include Register.com, GoDaddy.com, OnlyDomains.com and eNom.com.
The hosting services all work with the ICANN database, which is in charge of keeping track of all domain names, so they should all turn up the same information.

, These sites will all have an availability checker, where you type in the domain name you want and they tell you if it's available or suggest alternatives if it isn't. Some will even tell you if there is a cheaper domain with a slightly different name.

, Once you've found an available domain name, you'll want to select it and follow the instructions for that particular service. When you select your domain name, you will also have the opportunity to add on other services that the host also provides. Choose what's best for you.

, They will then ask for a bunch of information from you. This is necessary to register with the WHOIS database, where the owners of websites are required to list their information. This information can be made public or you can choose to keep in private (usually for an added fee).

, Websites aren't free! Enter your payment information and make sure it's correct. This is why it's a good idea to choose a reputable site: because they will have your payment information.

, Once you're registered with them and everything is good to go, you can start using their tools to upload stuff to your site. You can also set up uploading through software programs like Firefox or Dreamweaver.

, Now, the trick with hosting your website on your own servers is that some ISPs (internet service providers) don't allow this. They will block the traffic. So, the first thing to do is check with your ISP to make sure this is allowed and if you need to do anything special. If they don't allow it, you'll have to either change ISPs or change your mind about hosting.

, Choose either one of the major hosting services, or find a website that just does registration, like Domjax. You can simply register a domain name with most of the hosting companies; you don't have to also host with them. Just find a reputable and certifieddomain registrar.


Keep in mind that some hosts and registrars are only allowed to register certain top-level domains (or TLDs), like .org and .xxx, and so on.

, You'll need a server to host your site on. You can repurpose an old computer or you can get a straight-up server...whichever suits your needs best. Just make sure that it can handle the needs of your website. If you think you're going to be getting a lot of traffic, you'll need a fast system. Your local computer store staff person should be able to advise you on the best option for your needs.

, You'll need to set up your IP address to stay the same. Usually these change, but if yours changes people won't be able to get to your site! Think of the internet like a post office, and your IP address is like your address. It needs to stay the same if you want your mail to get to you!

, You'll need software to run your server, so choose one that works for you and that you can learn to use. The most common is Apache.

, Both your router and your firewall will need to be reconfigured to allow your website to work. Your router will need to correctly forward connections on port 80 and your firewall will need to allow the traffic to move through., Make sure that everything is correctly set up at that your domain traffic is sent to the correct location: your server! Test once you are done, both on your own computer and one at another location (like, another house) to make sure it works.

, You need to understand that running your own server poses a serious security risk, as it is much easier to hack, and you will need to take the appropriate security precautions. Pay constant attention to your website and make sure that there are no signs of a security breach.

, Did you find out that the domain name you wanted was already taken? Are you wanting to be sure that your domain name is optimal for people to find your website? You'll want to practice a few simple steps to get the name just right, rather that getting stuck and giving up or taking a less than great name.

, Choose a domain name that sounds current, and not like something out of the 90s or 00s. Avoid using numbers or letters for words (2, 4, U, etc), or other dated language.

, Choose a name that sounds professional and legitimate. Unless you want to be mistaken for a porn site or a scam, choose a name that sounds professional. For example, don't name your travel website Travel4U.biz and instead go with something like QualityTravel.net.

, The domain name should be easy to read. Avoid names that are made up of multiple words with the same letter or letters that look the same, such as wikihowworld or wikiliki. On many computers and print media, these will be difficult to read correctly.

, Shorter domain names are better, as these are easier to read, type, and remember. However, if your website can be easier to remember or stand out more at wikiHow.com, rather than wHow.com, then don't worry about it.

, If someone is going to learn about your website by word of mouth, you'll want it to be something that's easy to remember. This is why it's best to name it after your business or after yourself (if it's something like a portfolio site).

, Tie your domain name to your brand rather than your product. This will help people find you more easily and be easier to remember. It can also cut down on the price of your domain. For example, wikiHow.com is better than GoodInfo.com.

, Maximize SEO (search engine optimization) by taking advantage of Google's tools, like Google Trends and Google Keywords. They can help you find easier searchable or more commonly searched alternatives, as well as provide expected search numbers.

, Don't name your site in a way that could become a copyright issue. That's a whole nightmare that you don't want to deal with. Don't confuse the terms with common intellectual properties or make it something that might be abusive to someone's copyright. For example, naming your website DisneyMovies.com or PedoMickeyMouse.com is probably a terrible idea.

, Top-level Domains (or TLDs) are the final part of your domain name, the letters following the dot. There are two TLDs that are commonly used regardless of the nature of the site and that is .com or .net. These are useful as people will assume it is one or the other if they can't remember or do not know your website address.

, There are a few domains that are used for businesses, beyond the normal two, and you may want to consider them. Using one of the unusual TLDs can help keep costs down, as these usually cost less money to register. Examples include .biz, .info, as well as the industry specific and qualification-requiring options.

, While the .org TLD is now open to anyone, it is usually used to indicate an organization or non-profit entity. If you are such an entity, it would be a good idea to get one of these domains, as it will lend legitimacy to your organization.

, While the two most common TLDs are usually used in personal sites, you do have a wide variety of options available to you, if you would rather set yourself apart or save some money. Widely consider your options before settling.

, There are also TLDs for many of the different countries and regions. If you have a business that only operates within your country, it may be a good idea to choose one of these. They also serve to set your site apart and lower the cost, as the name will be in less demand.

, Make sure when you choose a name and TLD that you read out loud how the whole thing sounds together. Look for ways in which the spelling or pronunciation might change if the dot was removed. People will accidentally create awkward or offensive phrases, especially if choosing one of the non-standard TLDs. You can also use this to your advantage and make your web address a phrase, like ""noneofyour.biz"" or ""weare.us"".

, Some TLDs require certain credentials to get. These include TLDs like .aero, .int, .museum, or .pro. If you have the credentials necessary to get one of these domains, you may want to consider it. Otherwise, don't worry about these, as you will be unable to get them.

Keep yourself updated by reading tech blogs.",How to Secure Your Website," Upgrade whenever there is a new version of your script available. Be sure to do it as soon as the upgrade is released, regardless if the upgrade contains new features of not. Even simple point upgrades will fix bugs in the script.;
, Stay away from words that describe yourself or anything else that is easy to guess. The strongest passwords utilize numbers, letters and special characters. Make sure your passwords have both lowercase and capital letters, and are at least 10 characters long. You can use applications like KeePass and Lastpass to help you generate a strong password.

, Make sure that the admin email address that you use to login to your secure website is secure. This email address should be completely different from any addresses listed on your site's contact page. Keeping this email private will help prevent scammers from sending you phishing emails disguised as email from your host company.

, If your website uses a blog or forum script, you can change the default database table prefix. For example, a WordPress blog carries the table prefix ""wp."" If you change your table prefix, hackers will have a harder time getting data from your website.

, In most cases it is not required to assign a password, but having one can act as added security. Having a database password will not slow down the website at all.

, Once you have completed the installation, it is not necessary to have the installer folder on your computer. It is possible for a hacker to remotely get into your computer and run the installer again. Once they get in, they can empty your database and control your website and content. Another option is to rename the installation folder rather than delete it.

, Plugins can boost the core functionality of your website's script. Look to add plugins that will add extra security and install them. Download the plugin and follow the directional prompts to install.

, By following the leading blogs on technology, you can stay up to date on the last bugs and viruses that are on the Internet. Keeping current on this information will help you stay 1 step ahead and protect your site from threats.

Create a backup.,
Upload the modified file to the root directory of the old domain.,
Test the redirect.",How to Redirect a URL1," This is necessary for moving forward with the .htaccess method - check with your web host if you’re unsure.;
, An .htaccess file is a file that web servers check for information on how to handle errors, security, and redirect requests for your site. Check your root directory (where all your website files are stored) and then download the file for editing.

, If no .htaccess exists in your root folder currently, you can create one using an application like Notepad (or a similar plain text application). The code for the file is contained in the next step.


Make sure that when you save your .htaccess file it begins with a “.”
Note that this file has no tail extension (e.g. “.com” or “.txt”)

, Paste the following code into the .htaccess text file: .redirect 301 /old/oldURL.com http://www.newURL.com


In the code, ""oldURL.com"" represents the landing page address your visitors will need to be redirected from while ""http://www.newURL.com"" represents the address you'd like your visitors redirected to.
There should be exactly one blank space between ""oldURL.com"" and ""http://""
Don't add ""http://www"" to the (old) URL in the first part of the code!The code ""301"" is most commonly used on redirected sites and means ""moved permanently"". Research other ""300"" codes to learn about other functions.

, Change “http://www.newURL.com” to the domain address you'd like visitors to be redirected to.

, Change the dropdown to “all files” and save the file as .htaccess with no extension.

, Rename any existing .htaccess files or html files with the same name to keep a backup copy. For example use the name .htaccessbackup so that you can find and recognize the file in case you need to do a restore of the previous code.

, Now that you've modified the code you need to put this file back so the old URL can read it and redirect as planned.

, Open a new private browsing window and type the old domain name into your web browser. If you've done everything correctly it will redirect to the new site.Using a private browsing window simply ensures that your browser is accessing the new redirect instead of relying on cached data (data stored to help your most commonly visited pages load faster).
In lieu of a private browsing window, you can also clear your browser's cache through the browser preferences menu. For more information on how to do that, see Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache.

Establish the basics.,
Find out if the name you want is available.,
Find a website that can show you similar domain names that are available.,
Register your domain.,
Manage your website.,
Add themes.",How to Publish a Website on Your Own Domain," Your website will need two things:


A unique domain name. Each domain name is registered with a DNS (Domain Name Server), which identifies a domain name with a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address.
Space. Each website must have a web space allocated to it. This is provided by a web server, many of which are maintained by private companies.;
, Many websites (such as domainsbot) will catalogue which domains are available. Or, you can always try typing the domain you want into the URL field of your browser.

, Searching a taken domain will turn up similar domains that are still open. For example, if you want to register the domain name “domainhostingcompany.com” you'd see that “domainhostingcompany.co” is available but “domainhostingcompany.com” is already registered.

, Find a domain name registrar and sign up your domain. (To find a registrar, simply search ""domain name registrar."") You'll probably have to pay a start-up fee, as well as a yearly fee to keep the domain registered in your name. Afterward, the registrar will provide you with access to a control panel for your website.

, From the control panel, you can check your disk space and monthly bandwidth space. You can also upload and download the contents of the website, as well as updating the files and folders of the website using FTP server address.

, There are several applications that will apply themes (or designs) to your website.

Check with your web host.,
Pick a 3rd party service.,
Follow the instructions from the redirection service.,
Update the DNS records.",How to Redirect a URL2," If you're unsure of your own coding ability or just want to redirect a URL without digging into the code, there are several redirection services available and your current web host may be one of them. Many popular web hosts offer redirection services and the accompanying support to help you achieve your goals. Check on the features your current host/plan offers or contact them directly about what your options are.

, If your web host doesn't offer redirection, there are many other options out there. Depending on what your redirection needs are you may be able to do this for free.Many services allow you to configure options for your redirect such as the type (permanent or temporary) or whether query parameters are passed along.
Very few redirection services will allow you to forward HTTPS (secure) links.

, Typically these services are extremely user-friendly and can help walk you through the process, prompting you at each step for the correct information.


Note: in some cases you'll still need to be able to edit the DNS (domain name server) records for the domain names you'd like to redirect. These are accessible through your web host.

, Your 3rd party redirection provider will let you know if this is necessary and you can access and edit these records from your web hosting account.


The instructions to edit DNS records this step will vary by the service used, but typically both the redirection service provider and your web host will have easy-to-follow instructions.

Access the code for the page you want to redirect.,
Open the code for edits.,
Amend the code.,
Save the file and re-upload to your old domain.,
Test the redirect.",How to Redirect a URL3," This is a different method that involves you changing the webpage's code directly so you'll first need to download the files associated with the URL(s) you'd like to redirect away from.


Note that in most cases using a Meta command is not ideal for your redirect. Webpages with Meta code redirects are often filtered by search engines since it’s a known spam technique.

, Use “Notepad” or a similar text editor to open the webpage's code file. Save a backup or duplicate copy before making your edits to the code as a safety measure.

, The Meta code goes after the ""head"" tag (<head>) in the page's code. Type in :.<META http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""0;URL=http://www.newsite.com/newurl.html"">


There is exactly one blank space between ""refresh"" and ""content""
""0"" here stands for number of seconds before the redirect happens.
""www.newsite.com/newurl.html"" is the specific URL that the page is to be redirected to.

It's also possible to create a custom error message or an announcement that your sites has moved, but this may draw unwanted attention to your redirect!, If you are redirecting traffic from an old URL, it's likely that other changes have also taken place to your URL's code (e.g. the removal of your site content). What's important is that the URL code now contains the meta redirect code.

, Type the URL into your browser directly or use a search engine to find it. The page should now redirect immediately to the new URL you specified in the code without any messages or landing points in between.

Research other redirect code.,
Test the redirect.",How to Redirect a URL4," For each programming language, the appropriate redirect code may be slightly different. If you're unsure of the answer to this question, contact your web host for more information.

, There are different coded commands for each language and several options to explore within each language. A quick internet search is likely to yield the appropriate code for your site.


For instance it's easy to search for and find code for PHP, ASP, ColdFusion and Javascript redirects online., After finding the correct code for your site, implementation will be quite similar to the other coding methods outlined. Afterwards always make sure to test the redirect by visiting your (old) URL to see if things work as planned.

, You can prevent some direct linking by periodically changing the names of your files, folders, and images. The more often you change them, the less people can direct link successfully from you.

, If you know the images that are being direct linked to, do not change the filenames of them, but change the images themselves. Change each direct linked image to an advertisement for your site.

, The most effective way of stopping direct linking. You must have your own domain, AND your webserver/host must support Mod Rewrite.

, By encrypting your HTML, people will have a very hard time reading your source code. This is a great alternative if your webhost does not support Mod Rewrite. There are hundreds of programs that allow you to encrypt your HTML, but most of them charge a small fee. There is good news, though. I've found a JavaScript-based encryptor that you can use for free at HTML Encryption Utility.

, A good method to stop Hotlinking------------------------------------------------------------\Direct Linking. It can also do many other things but generally you should check with your ISP before setting this up

, Random data, combined with HTTP Referer validation is the only sure-fire way to completely secure your images from direct linking. Ex: /images/robinwilliams0205.jpg?rand=592603759

First of all, create a basic table layout to work on.,Save the file as Table1.html

,
Open Table1 in your browser and your table will be displayed in the basic form:

,
Now, let's start editing.,
Adjusting the space between cells by adding cellpadding and cellspacing commands to your code as follows:


cellpadding - increases a vertical dimensions of cells;
cellspacing - increases the border around the cells;

The result is shown below:



,
Specify the width of the table.,
Specify the width of columns, by setting the value on your data cells tag (td):


In previous step the width of the columns adjusted evenly.,
Specify the height of the table.,
Center the data in cell.,
Align the content vertically.,
Add colour to your table.,
Analogically set the background colour for rest of your cells.,

,, Simply add the width attribute to your code:


You can do it in either percentage or pixel width. In this example it is a set width of 600 pixel, and it will not change depending on the screen size. If you set it in percentage width, it would adjust to the screen size automatically.

, If you don't want your columns to be the same width, you cane set the width values separately for each column.

This is what you achieve by changing both widths:



, Just add the height command to the table tag. The height of rows will adjust evenly. The effect is shown below.

, Notice, that only Table Title has already been centered by the align attribute. The content in the rest of cell is left aligned by default. Add the align attribute to all cells by updating the code as shown below:

You don't need to actively do anything to submit your site to Google, but there are several things you can do to increase your chances of being indexed.

, The organization and hierarchy of your website has a big impact on whether or not your content will be indexed by Google. This means that your pages should have a manageable number of links, that all of your content is easily reachable with single links,

, If you have well-written, helpful content on your site, you have a higher chance of being indexed by Google. Avoid copying and pasting content from other sites, and make sure all of your content is clear, concise, and relates to your site's purpose. Include words and phrases that readers would use to find your site.


Make sure that important words and names are written out in text, and not just shown in pictures. Google cannot index words that are embedded in pictures.

Change files.,
Create 301 Redirects.,
Test.",How to Move Your Website to a New Domain," The following step is to change all instances of the old domain to the new domain within the files that you have moved over to the new account on your server. You will almost certainly be able to achieve this very quickly if you just use the find and replace feature in your FTP client (i.e FileZilla, Dreamweaver, etc.). Making all of your links absolute links rather than relative links is generally the best way to go for SEO purposes so if this is something that you had ever thought about changing over then now would be a good time to undergo and audit all of your website files to change relative links to absolute when suitable.;
, Setting up 301 redirects in your .htaccess (assuming you have a Linux server) under your previous account is very significant. A 301 redirect will work to automatically and permanently redirect visitors and search engine bots who visitwww.olddomain.com/my-page to www.newdomain.com/my-page. This is vital from an SEO viewpoint as 301 redirects have the potential to pass through the “link juice” of any backlinks pointing to the old domain to the new domain together with any associated search engine rankings. This is also crucial from a user point of view as anyone who tries to visit any page on your old domain will be automatically sent to the correct page on your new domain.

, Ensure that your nameservers have been set up on your new domain and that the DNS has finished propagating. Once you make sure that the DNS is resolving correctly for the new domain then it is time to test all of the old pages that you are redirecting from the old domain to the new domain and then also test by looking through every page of the new site and ensure that there are no faults. If all of the pages of your old site have been indexed by Google then a quick way to test that the 301 redirects have all been set up and working properly is to just do an advanced Google search query that will return all of the pages from your old site indexed by Google. You can do this just by typing “site:olddomain.com” into Google (without the “”). Now all you have to do is click on each page and if you have set up the 301 redirects correctly then each time you click on the page link your server should automatically and instantly redirect you to the suitable new page on your new domain.To avoid confusion, it's best to ensure you maintain control of your old site domain for at least 180 days.We all know that moving is never easy – but these steps must help ensure that none of your good web reputation falls off in the process.

Pick the top level domain the web hosting account shall be running under.,
Sign up for a web hosting package that includes addon domains.

,
Once you have signed up you will receive login information as well as you will receive so-called DNS server information from your web host.,
In your web hosting control panel at your web hosting account select the addon feature option.,
Create the different website files and upload them to the matching sub folders.

",How to Host Multiple Websites on a Single Web Hosting Account,";
, This will be your main domain name you want to work with.

,, Go to the domain registry where you registered the different domain names and change the DNS server settings to the DNS servers provided by your web host

, Here you can point the additional domain names to a sub folder inside your main web hosting account. This step will register the additional domain names with the web server application. The web server will now ""listen"" to incoming http requests based on the host name (aka domain name). Incoming http requests for addon domain names will then be directed to the appropriate sub folders.

Mainly websites with multiple pages need to be constantly monitored for broken links. This can be done with tools. Once you spot any such broken links immediately rectify the URL.;
, Actually this file has multiple functions. Here we are going to focus on one of its major functionality relating to web traffic channelization. By incorporating this .htaccess file you can direct all your visitors to either www or non www page. Once you do this all your web traffic will be directed to uniform URL structure.

Businesses may want to conduct market research or run a focus group to help this process along. If you're starting a website on a small budget, just have a brainstorm session by yourself or with a few friends.


If you'll be writing about products, search for similar products on online marketplaces. Look for common phrases in the product names and descriptions.
Search for online forums related to your website topic. Read through some of the post titles and popular discussions to find topics of interest.
Stick to keywords that accurately describe your website.If you only sell chairs, ""furniture"" is too broad and ""bar stools"" is irrelevant. There's no point attracting people who aren't interested in your website.;
, This tool is aimed at advertisers, but website creators frequently use it to find out how often people search for their keywords. Sign up for a Google AdWords account, then visit the Keyword Planner Tool. Use the tools provided to narrow down your search:


First, fill out the Search for new keyword... form with a few generic descriptions of your website. From the results, add popular keywords that describe your website to your brainstorm list.
Next, enter all the keywords from your brainstorm list into the Get search volume... form. Optionally, select a location for your target audience, but only if you're focusing on local content. Ignore the Negative Keywords option, which is only relevant for advertisers.

, In the Keyword Planner results, look at the ""Average Monthly Volume"" column (ignoring the other, advertiser-focused columns). Cross any phrases off your list that don't reach your target search volume. What this search volume is depends on how you're using the keyword:Keywords for your home page or overarching website theme should have thousands of searches each month.
A keyword for a single product page or blog post should have hundreds of searches.
A search volume under 100 means that your website can probably get into the top results for that term. Since very few people will see those results, this is only useful if building a niche community or running a business with a small number of high-profit transactions.

, You've narrowed your options down to the most popular searches, but you're not done yet. If large companies and well-established websites are targeting the same term, your website might be pushed out of the results. First, sign out of your Google account to make sure the results aren't tailored to you. Search for each phrase separately in a search engine, to get an idea of the current competition. These are all signs that the keyword will face heavy competition, and should probably not be your main focus:More than 10 million results.
The maximum number of ads (on Google, that's 3 on the top and 7 on the right)
Famous websites at the top of the results
The exact keyword phrase appears in the title of several top results.

, Stuffing as many keywords as possible into your site is no longer a good way to climb the rankings. Use the keywords a couple times near the start of the page, and wherever it seems relevant. Keywords are mostly useful for titles, headers, and URLS, as described in the next section.You won't be penalized for using keywords so common that they're ordinary phrases, such as ""San Francisco"" or ""macaroni and cheese."" Penalties show up much faster as you repeat hyper-specific keywords, such as ""fast easy macaroni and cheese at home."", Every page on your website should have a unique title. Each search engine displays the title of the page when it displays results, and may use the title to figure out what the page is about. This is an excellent place to use keywords, but only if they accurately describe the content on the page. Keep the title short, since search engines will cut off the title after a certain length.If you're writing the HTML yourself, type in <title>Your Title Here</title> inside the <header> section.
If you are using website creation tools, the title is usually generated from the name of your blog post. You may be able to change it in the settings or the ""header"" document.

, These should be helpful and easy for real people to read. They don't have a major effect on ranking by themselves, but they're still one of your best tools for bringing the right people to your site.Use keywords if they accurately describe the page, but focus on the reader, not the bots.


To add a description in HTML, type <meta name=""description"" content=""Write two to five sentences here describing what this page is about."">. This will not show up on the page, but some of it may show up in search engine results.
Think of headers as smaller titles for each section of a long page. These do show up on the page, so choose short headers that people can use to quickly find content. These come in several sizes, from <h1>The Most Important</h1> to <h6>the least important</h6>.
If you are using website or blog software instead of HTML, you may need to read the FAQ to find out how to add descriptions and headers.

, Your website probably has many pages. Both search engine bots and actual visitors should be able to easily find every page, figure out what each is for, and navigate between them. Here are some tips to accomplish this:Organize your site directory. Each folder in your site directory should have a clear purpose and name. You want a URL like wikihow.com/making-websites/seo, not vague or unclear URLs like wikihow.com/directory7/hi-guys.
Make sure you can reach any page by starting at the home page and clicking links. A page that can only be reached from another site or by manually typing the URL will not show up at all on search engine results.
Add ""breadcrumb navigation"" at the top or bottom of each page, so visitors can easily return to more general pages. For instance, a chocolate cupcake recipe might have breadcrumb links ""Home → Baking → Cupcakes""

, There are many free sitemap generating websites that will create an organized list of pages on your website. Submit this XML Sitemap using Google WebMaster tools, and preferably to other search engines such as Yahoo and Bing as well.


If you are using blogging software, you may be able to download a plugin that does this for you.

, The steps above allow search engines to find each page on your site, and identify what it's about. Many site owners want to learn further ""tricks"" to get their page higher up the ranking. These appealing shortcuts have little to no effect. Search engines frequently update their algorithms to close these loopholes, often turning what was once a mild boost into a severe ranking penalty.Here are a few examples of SEO practices that will only harm your website:

Don't use keywords in anchors (text displayed as links), although brand names are fine.Don't add keywords as text invisible to the user. Search engine bots don't care what color your text is, they can still see it and penalize you for keyword stuffing.Don't use keywords unrelated to your topic. This may initially attract more visitors, but your rankings will soon plummet when search engines notice that all of them leave right away., Many people make the mistake of thinking that only search engine bots matter for SEO. Actually, you should think of the work you do for bots as basic preparation. You've invited people to your party, sent out invitations, and made sure everyone knows the place and time. If you want people to actually show up and enjoy themselves — and get your site higher in the rankings — you need to make content that real visitors enjoy. If you ever write a paragraph that doesn't help the user, delete it.

Check all content for grammar, spelling, and readability. Try not to wander off topic or pad the article with unnecessary content.

, Customers can tell when a business gets ""pushy,"" and they don't like it. Many more people will return to your site and recommend it to friends if the content seems balanced and objective. It's all right to advertise a product, but don't go over the top with your claims.Use hard facts to sell your product. Explain how your product is different from your competitors', and why that makes it better. If possible, include data from unbiased sources, not just your own research.
If you're running a personal website, be honest about the products you endorse. Endorse products you actually use and enjoy, and be honest about their flaws.
User content is inherently more trustworthy. A basic comment system is a good start, but consider including forums for user discussion, or featuring especially good comments as their own blog post.

, Phones and tablets make up more of the internet browsing audience every year. Try viewing your website on a small screen and think about how you could improve the experience. Images and video content attract much more attention than a wall of text.Keep the in-depth content, but don't use it as your top-of-the-page hook., If you make contacts within your field, especially within a blogging community, you may be able to ask for links directly. More commonly, you'll need to build content that news organizations and respected blogs find worthwhile, and build enough presence that they discover the content and link to it. Try to think of content that no one else has, whether that's useful advice or an appealing personal story. More direct opportunities are harder to come by, but keep an eye out for the following:Look at news sites or blogs that frequently link out to your type of content. If you discover a dead link, contact the author of the page and suggest that they replace the article with something focused on your content instead.
Educational or government sources tend to have higher authority. If you can write a review of their programs or volunteer your services, you may earn a valuable backlink.
Never purchase backlinks. Once search engines detect this, you will receive a severe penalty to your rankings.

, Easier said than done, becoming an authority in your field will earn you a respected spot in the rankings. All of the steps above will help achieve this in the long term, but consider the following as well:Use content creators with name recognition or professional qualifications, even if it's just for a guest post.
Share your content on social media."

, Next, the wizard would check DNS for information about the domain. If an SPF record does exist, you are able to verify its contents in this step. If there is no SPF record, the information that is displayed for the domain's MX(mail server) and A(host) records would enable you to create a new SPF record. As an example, since contoso.com is an imaginary domain, there would be no SPF record.The displayed information would look like this :

No SPF record has been found for the domain contoso.com. However, MX and/or A records currently exist for this domain.

, Long sentences, rarely used words, and an idiom used only by the highly educated, are never required online. Look for talented content writers who can convey important information in the easiest words with a good flow and tone.

, Your site will require quality content at least as often as your competition refreshes theirs. You should ideally refresh and replenish your content at least every four months, although that depends to some extent on the kind of site you have.

, Professional content is best written by relevant professionals in your vertical who are great writers as well. Difficult to find the combination? Let the professionals create the content and then have a freelance or in-house editor touch up the grammar, construction, and other linguistic aspects.

, There are many writers around these days (practically everyone is a writer of sorts!), but the really good ones are relatively fewer. Hold on to your content writer. They are going to get more precious very soon and will prove to be 100% cost-effective.

, Do not ask your web designer to write pages that relate to neurosurgery, foreign exchange, or English as a second language. Speak to an expert about providing such content as will go well on your site.

, Also, ensure that you provide ALL the information a visitor might look for on your website. This will help you to know if you might have a connection.

, A good way to find out what it is that people want more information on - even within the limited scope of your vertical - is to frequent the social network your audience goes to. Ask them point blank, if there aren't enough clues already. It is a question of being SOCIAL on a social network and not trying to market at all. Those two are critically important.

,

Place the bPermissions.jar into the plugin folder, and run the server so that the files are generated.






Once the server has fully loaded, type ""stop"" and close the console.







,

Inside your plugins folder you should now see a new folder called bPermissions.






Open this folder, and you will see some new files. For now, we will leave these files as they are.







,


Open the world folder and you will see a YAML file for each world you have on your server. If you have only the default worlds you will see two files, groups.yml, and users.yml.






These are the files that we use to create permission groups and assign groups to players.

,

Open the group.yml in notepad. It is usually an empty file in latest version of servers. If you should see two square brackets: []. Delete them so we have an empty file.







,

For this wikiHow, you will be using three groups, player, moderator, and admin. You may choose to have more, or less groups than this.






Write without quotes, ""default: "", and then the name of your default group, mine will be ""player"". Your first line should look like the line in the image.







,

We can now add the groups to the world file.






Go to the next line and type groups:






Then, go to the next line, and add four spaces, making sure you don't add tabs, and no tabs were added automatically. Write the name of your first group. Go to the next line, four spaces, name of second group.
Repeat until all your groups are listed. They should look similar to the groups in the image.



,

You will now need to add the basic permissions each group will have. With bPermissions, you will be assigning multiple groups to your players.






Instead of groups of players, it will be, groups of permissions added to your players. Generally, your default group will be a base group. It will contain all the permissions you want every player to have.






So in your default group, go to the next line, add 4 spaces and add the permission:







- bPermissions.build: This will allow the player to place and break blocks.
Then, under your admin type group, add the permission:



- bPermissions.admin






It should look similar to the image.







,

As the plugin Essentials has a lot of permissions and is quite popular.






Just like in the previous step, add the permissions you want each group to have. But keep in mind, the permissions should be relevant to the group.






Here are some permissions for the MOTD, teleporting to spawn, and home / sethome commands to the player group. Kick and ban permissions to the moderator group, and Bukkit server commands to the admin group.






Your groups.yml should now look similar to the one in the image.







Note: if you have a lot of plugins, you will probably have a lot of permission nodes to add. But, take your time to make sure it is formatted correctly, and no tabs have been added.





,

Now that we have the permissions added, it is a good idea to add the players that will have the bPermissions.admin node to the file. This permission will allow the player to add groups to other players in-game.






In this example there are three players; Notch, Jeb, and NewGuy.






Notch is an admin, so he has all three permission groups, meaning, he can do everything a default player can, as well as, what a moderator can, and is able to use the server commands too.
Jeb, as the moderator has the default player permissions and the moderator permissions.
Finally, NewGuy has only just joined the server, so he is automatically given the permissions of the default group.

As new players join the server, they will automatically be added to this list.
Make a new line, type players:
New line, 4 spaces, add the player name like this: Notch:
Then, another line, 4 spaces, and add the groups. Repeat for all players you wish to manually add.
Your groups.yml, should look similar to the image.





,
Your permissions are now setup. You can save the file and it should work as expected. However, many people like to add a prefix to their name so they know which players are in which groups.
To do this, you need a chat plugin. The plugin I recommend is bChat.

,
bChat has just one file, config.yml.
Open the config.yml and you are able to format the chat for your server. The format that you could use is: format: '+PREFIX +WHITE+NAME: +WHITE+MESSAGE'

,
To add a prefix to a group we must open up the groups.yml that we added all our permissions to. The prefix is added using a permission.
The permission is:
- prefix.priority.prefix
The priority works like this: The higher the number, the higher the priority.
For example, we added three groups to the player Notch. Each of those groups could have a permission node for a prefix. So we use the priority to make sure that the prefix for the highest ranking group is used.
So for the default group we might use a priority of 10, moderator could be 20, and admin 30. Here is an example of a prefix that is the group in square brackets
- prefix.30.This would produce:
Notch: message here
We can also add color to the prefix:
- prefix.30.+REDThis prefix system is useful as it allows us to use the multi-group system, while still providing a way for per group prefixes.
Your groups.yml may look similar to the image.

,
You can use commands to add/remove groups to players, and add/remove permission nodes from groups. The command is:
/p For example,
/p global addgroup admin JebAdds the admin group to the player Jeb.

Go to the webpage's ""comments"" section.If the page does not list the number of comments, count them manually.Multiply the number of comments by 200 for a ballpark average of how many viewers your page has had.Remember that this method is not 100 percent accurate. This is merely to give yourself a rough estimate, based on average percentages., If you embedded YouTube or Vimeo in your website, all you need to do is go to a video and click to play it. Both YouTube and Vimeo will show how many views your video received, but only if the videos are publicly shared.

That number includes people who briefly clicked on it and then left as well, but it should help you get a rough idea of your web traffic."

When searching for the right online backup, here are some things to look for:


Amount of space available: Make sure that the company you use will be able to support all the files that you need backed up.,
Compare and contrast: Before you decide on one company, take into account all the other companies out there.",How to Choose an Online Backup Provider," You don't want to have to pick and choose which files you should back up and which ones you will leave up to chance.

Take care about your computer safety first of all.,
Another important point to take care of would be defending your computer from viruses.,
When your PC or laptop is protected, you can use one of anonymizing services Anonymous proxy server , Anonymize net , or similar to secure your IP address making it invisible for the outside world.,
Anonymizing services will allow you to protect your Internet connections from monitoring and ISP block/limitations.,
Anonymizing provides protection for all Internet activities with the exception of sending e-mail messages, which use a special protocol (way of sending Internet traffic).

,
The main point when sending email messages anonymously and securely is the opportunity to use the address of your choice, which would not lead back to you.,
If you have Internet presence you may think about offshore hosting for your domains as well as it does not matter where in the Internet your sites are located and offshore hosts allow more freedom and security for users.

",How to Get Secured in the Internet," Begin with the hard drives data protection – a free tool BestCrypt allows encrypting your entire hard drive, including the operating system area, not only selected folders. This would guarantee that only the PC owner could access all the data on a PC. Avoid utilities “hiding” your folders. Using these tools you can hide something from your kids only (and not in all cases).;
, It is an integral part of the efforts to protect your online privacy. Failing to protect your computer from viruses and network attacks can result in serious damages for your business and privacy. There is a number of firewalls and antivirus programs available. Avast can make an efficient option. It is free for personal use.

, The main idea of such anonymizing service is that you pass your Internet traffic, you wish to make anonymous, to them, and they will pass it to the destination using their own IP addresses. Most of such services are paid up and the experience shows that free services are unreliable and suitable for occasional use only.

, You will not leave trails with your IP address in web server logs, chat room logs, peer-to-peer file sharing systems, newsgroups, mail servers, mailing lists, etc., any longer. No trails – no tracking.

,, Another important point is sending the messages securely via a special tunnel, which cannot be snooped. If all these conditions are met, your e-mail messages will be delivered intact with no trails pointing to you (unlike popular services of Google, Yahoo and similar, which keep your IP address). An example of secure email can be found at MuteMail

Look for suspicious activity.,
Avoid visiting websites that are sent through emails.,
Avoid websites that seem too good to be true.",How to Identify Trustworthy Informational Websites," When a website utilizes a secure connection, often the web address will be prefixed with https:// rather than the usual http://. Some browsers may even provide indications for a secure website, such as changing the color of the web address bar or displaying a security icon.


If the website utilizes a secure connection, that is a good indicator of trustworthiness. Secure connections are used to encrypt the information being sent to and from the website, making it difficult for hackers to snoop around.;
, Trust certificates are handed out by Internet trust organizations, and the trust certificate will usually be displayed on their site in the form of an image. Some fraudulent websites can put up counterfeit trust images, though, so if you are unsure of a site's trust validity, contact the trust organization on the trust image to see if that site is registered with them.

, If the brand or name of a website is well-known or well-liked, chances are they are legitimate. For example, Google, Amazon, and eBay are all popular so they are likely to be legitimate if you've reached their official website.

, Suppose you've arrived at the website of ""Dzzzt Tools"" and you want to check their legitimacy. You can search for ""Dzzzt Tools review"" or ""Is Dzzzt Tools legitimate,"" and most of the time you'll find comments from others who have used the website describing their results--whether good or bad.

, For example, if you were not intending on giving out your personal information (such as when shopping online) but the website asks you to input sensitive data, then you should cautious. Never give away any of your personal details on a website that hasn't earned your trust.

, Emails can be faked to look like they are arriving from a certain email address even when they weren't sent from there. Furthermore, links within emails can be faked to look like they'll take you to one destination but take you to a clone website that is setup to look like the original website. You could end up entering your information into a look-alike website.

, If a website's authenticity and validity are in question and they claim to be providing an unbelievable offer, you should probably skip it and move on. Great deals and offers should only be pursued on websites you are familiar with or websites with a good reputation.

So - just as you wouldn't provide personal information to telemarketers and people you don't know - you shouldn't provide it to anyone asking you for that in any email.;
, When your bank, credit card company, loan company, etc. sends you an email it is usually personalized. It's only common courtesy to use your name. So this would also be an indication that the email is a scam.

, This is the part that confuses most people. ""Masking"" a link is simply asking you to click on a link that directs you somewhere else than what you thought you were clicking on. A simple way you can catch this is buy moving your cursor over the link and looking at the bottom of your browser on the status bar. This will show you the actual website the link is going to take you to.

, You need to make sure that the lock in the status bar is locked. This ensures you that the page you are on is secure. If it doesn't have the lock, then any personal information that you put on there could be compromised.

Understand an IP address and what you can do with it.,
Decide whether you need to find a user's IP address.,
Find the user's Skype nickname.,
Write down the username or copy it to your clipboard.,
Make sure the user is online.,
Open a Skype resolver in your Internet browser.,
Type or paste the Skype username into the appropriate text box, and click ""Resolve."",
Look up information about the IP address you found to verify it and learn more.,
If you wish to report an abusive user by IP address rather than username, do so via email.",How to Find the IP Address of a Skype User," An IP address is analogous to a mailing address. It can reveal information about a user's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and geographical location, but doesn't show sensitive or private information about the user themselves.The only way to get that information is to go through the ISP, a process which requires a warrant or court order.For further security, your computer and internet activity are almost always well-protected with firewalls and other defense mechanisms, and your IP address can change frequently.

It is possible to flood an IP address with enough information that it can't connect to the Internet. This will almost definitely not happen to you - and if it does, simply change your IP address to stop it.
While you won't be able to do much with an IP address, turning it over to the authorities when reporting an abusive user can help them more efficiently deal with the problem.;
, You can easily block and report an abusive user without it. This will prevent them from contacting you in any way. From your Contacts page in Skype, right click on the abusive user and select ""Block Contact."" A dialog box will appear asking you if you are sure you want to block this user. There will also be a box to report abuse from this person. Check that box and click Block.

In addition to blocking and reporting a user, report an incident of harassment to Skype via email at abuse@skype.net. Include in your email as much specific information as you can give, including screenshots of conversations.
Unblock a user by using the Contacts dropdown menu and selecting ""Manage Blocked Users..."" This will take you to the settings, and a dialog box will pop up with a list of your blocked contacts. Select the user you wish to unblock and click ""Unblock.""

, In Skype, go to your contacts. Find the user you want to investigate and either click on their picture or right click on their name and select ""View Profile."" The profile has a list of contacts for the user, including (if available) Skype username, phone number, and email address.


If the user is not one of your contacts, search for their name in the Skype search bar, as you would to find a new contact. When you find the correct user, navigate to their profile page. You won't be able to see their full profile, but you will be able to see their username, which is all you need.

, From the user's profile page, right click on the username and select ""Copy.""

, Looking up the IP of a user when they're not online can give you an error or a wrong IP address, so for best results wait until the user is online before trying to find their IP address.

, Because of the way Skype is programmed, the IP addresses of users are exposed while they're connected to the Internet, sending and receiving data through Skype. This exposure can be exploited to discover IP addresses for online users. Skype resolvers do just that. Given a username for an online user, they can discover and reveal the corresponding IP address.


Use http://resolvethem.com, or Google ""Skype resolver"" to find more options.

, The resolver will look up and then display the user's IP address. This step may take several seconds to a minute, depending on the resolver you use.

, Click the gear button on the top right corner of your Yahoo Mail to bring down the Settings menu. Click the “Account Info” link from here. You will be brought to your Yahoo account data.

, Click the “Recent Activity” menu from the left panel. All the recent activities made by your Yahoo account will be displayed. Most items here will involve your login or session records, since Yahoo keeps track of these.

, Look at all the activities listed on the Recent Activity menu and see if there’s anything out of the ordinary. Check and verify if you are the one who made all these. Yahoo keeps a record of your sign-in history for the past 30 days.

, If you see something suspicious—for example a sign in from a device or a location you didn’t know of—click the record for the activity. A small window will appear displaying the sign-in history under the device for the location for the last 30 days.

, The IP address for every sign in is recorded with each entry. You can then use this to track your hacker, since IP addresses are unique. You may need to work with your local Internet service provider and/or law enforcement agency to track down the IP address’ exact location and your hacker.


It is very unlikely that you will be able to track down the individual who hacked your account via the IP address. The chances are good that a person wasn’t even involved, and that your account was compromised by an automated hacking program. The best thing you can do is change your password to prevent future hacks.

, This is an additional layer of security. Yahoo will send you a text message whenever you log into your account. You’ll need to enter the code you receive in order to access the account. This will prevent unauthorized users from accessing your account information."

Choose an SEO analytics program.,
Establish a baseline.,
Analyze the effectiveness of your SEO campaign, using data (metrics) from your SEO analytics program.,
Track changes.",How to Measure SEO Improvements," SEO analytics programs track and report on data that can be used to determine the effectiveness of your SEO campaigns.


Some web hosting companies offer free and/or minimally priced analytics services to their customers.
You can find a number of specialized analytics programs online, offering a wide array of tools and measurements, and at a variety of price points.
Google Analytics is a free service, providing a comprehensive list of tools you may use to measure your site's SEO success.;
, Once you initialize your analytics program, record the first measurements, before applying SEO strategies. This will be used to measure any changes your website incurs as a result of your search engine optimization efforts.

, It is necessary to gauge several different aspects of SEO effectiveness, as they correlate with each other and provide you with a complete picture of how well your SEO improvements are working. From your SEO analytics program dashboard, you should be able to monitor several different metrics:


Traffic is the amount of visitors, or hits, your website gets.
Keyword ranking metrics show you how your site ranks in comparison with other sites when specific keywords are used to find your site, and can be instrumental in fine-tuning your site's search engine optimization. For example, you may find that using the keyword phrase, ""best hairdressing in Texas,"" results in a lower ranking, while using the keyword phrase, ""best Texas hairstylist"" results in a higher ranking.
Page indexing refers to search engine page recognition, and not all web pages are recognized by search engines. One of the goals of search engine optimization is to maximize the probability that search engines will recognize as many of your site's pages as possible. By assessing your page indexing metrics, you are able to measure SEO success in that respect.
In addition to the effectiveness (ranking power) of your keywords, you also want to measure how many keywords search engines are picking up and using from your site to index your pages. The more keywords being used, the better.
link-backs are links to your website that appear on other websites, such as blogs, social networking sites and bookmarking sites. Linkbacks increase your site's visibility and ranking, and SEO improvements should increase your link-backs.
Conversions are website visitors who turn into customers. Increasing the bottom line is a top concern of business owners interested in search engine optimization. Therefore, it is important to gauge the increase or decrease in conversions yielded by an SEO campaign. In order to calculate your conversions, divide the total number of visitors to your site by the total number of sales. For example, if your site has 1000 visitors and 10 sales, then your website is netting 1 sale per 100 visitors.

, Use 2 separate, but correlating, calendars to measure SEO success on an ongoing basis. Your SEO analytics program may provide reports to you in calendar form, or you may use a spreadsheet program to create custom calendars.


Keep a week-to-week, month-to-month and year-to-year calendar to monitor changes in your SEO effectiveness and identify changes that may be seasonal. This calendar may be in standard calendar format, but should include spaces to record analytics information. Record the traffic, keyword, indexing, conversions and links metrics every Monday of every week so that you can spot trends that may be associated with the time of year. For example, you may find that your conversions naturally increase during the holiday seasons, and that they naturally decrease when the school year starts.

Water block: The water block is attached to component to be cooled. It is responsible for transferring heat away from the component and into the liquid.
Radiator: The radiator transfers heat from the liquid into the ambient air. Radiators run water through pipes that transfer heat to metal fins and fans blow air to draw heat away from the fins. Radiators vary both in the size and number of fans.
Fans push air though radiators, actively exchanging heat from the system with the ambient air. These vary in size ranging from 40mm to 200mm, but the most common fan size for radiators is 120mm.
Reservoir: The reservoir holds reserve liquid, provides a visual gauge for determining liquid loss in the system, and provides an easy fill point for the system.
Pump: The pump pushes the liquid through the system. Though pumps are often incorporated into reservoirs, a separate pump may be needed for large or complicated systems.
Thermal paste: Thermal paste provides better conduction between the components and the heat sink or water block. The paste eliminates air gaps which would impede thermal conduction.
Tubing: Tubing directs fluid from component to component. Tubing is generally sold as flexible PVC, though other materials such as Neoprene and rigid acrylic are also used. Tubing is often labeled with two measurements an inner diameter followed by an outer diameter. The inner diameter is used for finding compatibility for tube fitting barbs which attach the tubing to each of the components and the out diameter is needed to purchase compatible clamps.;
, There is a massive range in the complexity, performance, and price of a liquid cooling system. Simple kits can consist of only a water block and radiator (pictured)

where complex builds can contain multiple branches for CPUs, GPUs, and RAM. The following instructions assume a single loop system with a single water block, radiator, pump and reservoir., As a result, liquid cooling installations can range in price from around $100 for a basic setup to several thousand dollars for high end enthusiast builds. The build above includes of the components assumed in the following instructions, but the specific parts are included only as an example and you should tailor the parts you buy to your desired system.

, Cases can vary in sizes ranging from MicroATX to ATX Super Tower. In some cases, a liquid cooling system can allow more compact computing systems by eliminating the need for air space, but such systems need to be designed carefully and go beyond the scope of this article. A case of at least ATX Mid-Tower is recommended. Also, ensure that your case will have adequate air flow after installation of your system. A good liquid cooling system will just become a water heater if air can't flow through the system.,

Power: ensure that you power supply can handle the additional load created, check the How to check a power supply for details.
Socket: CPUs come in a variety of different sockets, ensure that the water block in your system is designed to fit your CPU socket. Your socket type should be listed with your motherboard and CPU documentation.

, Sending back parts can be time consuming and costly. A drawing, even a crude illustration, can assist in visualizing your build. Ensure that all parts in the system are compatible with each other and that you have all the needed power connectors available from your power supply., Coolants are the active carrier of heat in the system. Many systems use distilled water, which is cheap and easy to replace; however, water can cause an electric short if the system develops a leak and organisms can grow in the system if a biocide is not implemented. If you desire colored or fluorescent liquid ensure that dyes are certified for use in liquid cooling systems or use a pre-mixed fluid from a certified vendor. Otherwise the dyes and additives can congeal and clog the system., Many general purpose electronics vendors sell liquid cooling kits and there are at least a couple of websites which have a wide selection of liquid cooling components for sale. Also many manufacturers allow you to purchase directly from their website., Any clear and clean surface large enough to spread the parts out will suffice, but a plain white bed sheet is especially useful as it will aid in keeping track of small parts. Ensure that all pieces are present before proceeding further., The previous heat sink and thermal paste will need to be removed. Use a lint-free cloth and rubbing alcohol to remove the previous paste.,

Many reservoirs fit in 5.25"" drive bays, but may require the front plates be taken off in advance.
There may be cover plates on the case where radiators can be mounted, ensure the cover plate is removed and ensure all tube ports are clear.
Manage cables to be a neat as possible. Poor cable management can limit access to components and impede air flow through the system, decreasing cooling performance.

,

Apply only the manufacturer recommended amount of thermal paste, probably just a small button and clean up any excess when placing the water block onto the CPU.
If the water block is secured by screws, tighten the screws incrementally in a cross pattern, otherwise, uneven pressures could damage the CPU.

, Ensure a solid attachment to the case and double check airflow from the front and back ends of the radiator., If your reservoir or pump are free standing, ensure that they properly secured to your case and does not impede airflow., Slide tube clamps onto the tube ""before"" attaching the tube ends. Though the goal should be to minimize the total tube length in the system, your top priority is to ensure that the tube does not kink. Kinks drastically reduce system performance and will put undue stress on your pump. Always err on the side of using too much tubing as a length of tubing can always be cut shorter, but never made longer., Ensure that the pump and radiator are connected to your power supply as well as any lights that may have come with your system. Use the paper clips tester from part 1 of How to Check a Power Supply to power the liquid cooling system without powering on the main computer. This way, if a leak is to form, the computer is at less of a risk of shorting out. But before you turn the system on. . ., Ensure that every clamp is secure and the tubing and components are free of cracks and other damage., Fill the reservoir only until approximately 90% full to prevent back splash in the event of system pressure or heat expansion in the fluid., When this happens, power off the system and refill the reservoir until it is 90% full again., Listen for excess noise from your pump or radiator. Some noise is a sign that the parts are working, but sounds of the part straining or clicking from misalignment can indicate a problem., Now connect the computer power cables for normal operation and power the system on. Check your system temperatures under heavy system load to ensure your cooling system is performing well."

Low Performance: If you’re looking for a simple PC for web browsing, email checking, or video watching, a low performance machine is probably the way to go. These are small, very low budget, don’t draw a lot of power, and are usually pretty quiet (obviously you won't need much performance for those activity). Home theater PCs, simple office work PC fit into this category. Such machines range from $200 to $300.

Mid Performance: This is a great option for the majority of users, especially since you can stretch the machine’s power and your budget to fit almost any scenario. Such machines will sit in a smaller case, with enough power to play some casual games and run multiple programs at once. If you’re looking for a multipurpose computer that won’t break the bank, this is where you want to go. Such machines can vary quite a bit in price, but in general they range from $300 to $500.

High Performance: These will stretch you budget to its end. Users doing more resource-intensive tasks: converting and editing video, playing latest games at low to mid settings, making 3D art, running operating systems in virtual machines will need more performance. These also use a generous amount of electricity. Typically such a machine may cost anywhere from $500 to $700.;
, Even with the following steps, this process is going to be overwhelming—especially if you don’t keep up with all the latest hardware news (as many of us don’t). Note that these descriptions are bound to become outdated as time goes on, so in addition to reading the information below, check out some pre-built systems comparable to what you want to build. That’ll help you figure out what kind of processor applies to mid-range builds, how much RAM you’d find in a high-end build, and so on.

You should also consider the OS you want to run, and the programs you’ll be using, and check their recommended system requirements. Make sure you avoid bottlenecks, where one component can’t reach its full potential because another part is too slow. There will be a few reputable brands mentioned in each category, but we recommend reading up on when brand really matters (and when it doesn’t) so you don’t fall into advertising trap.

, The Processor (CPU) is the “brain” of your computer. Better CPUs can perform more tasks at once, and perform them faster.The high performance models are only really crucial if you’re performing intensive tasks. It’s also one of the most expensive parts of a machine.Hence picking the “right” processor is important, you should do some research so you don’t want to end up wasting money. Lets start with the basics:


Consider clock speed and number of cores. A processor’s clock speed determines how many instructions one core can carry out in one second. Thus, higher clock speed means your computer carries out instructions faster, while more cores means it can carry out more sets of instructions at one time. Some programs can utilize multiple cores at once, making them extremely efficient with multi-core CPUs, but also multitask well since they can carry out multiple sets of instructions simultaneously. Low performance machines probably will need a dual/quad-core processors, mid-range builds will probably want quad/six-core processors, and high-powered machines will definitely want six/eight-core or above.
You’ll then want to look at clock speed to determine how fast that processor is. For gaming, clock speed is more important than number of cores, since most games are not designed to use more than one or two cores (though this is starting to change). Assuming you never do any CPU-intensive tasks, a dual-core is probably the highest you need—no hyper-threading needed. If you’re converting video or gaming, the program you use might support multiple cores, in which case a higher number of cores is more important.
Those are two basics, but not the only ones, and you don’t want to rely on them alone. It's recommended to look at benchmarks for the processors you’re interested in, to get an idea of how they compare.
Be sure to look for other features you may need, too. If you aren’t gaming, you’ll want to make sure your CPU supports integrated graphics (so you don’t need a graphics card), and if you’re going to be using virtual machines, make sure your CPU supports Intel’s VT -x or AMD-V.

Brands to Watch For: AMD and Intel are the two CPU heavyweights. Though Intel’s processors tend to perform better and use less power, AMD’s processors are generally less expensive for the same amount of clock speed.







, The motherboard connects all the other components to one another. It is the physical base upon which you build everything else. It contains a lot of your machine’s core features, like the number of USB ports, the number of expansion cards you can put in (such as graphics card, etc), and also partially determines how big your computer size will be. Which motherboard you pick will depend on whether you build a low, medium, or high performance machine. As you look at motherboards, you’ll want to pay attention to quite a few things. Here are some of the more important features:



Socket Type: Your socket type (such as AMD’s ""AM2"", “AM3”, ""AM3+"" socket, or Intel’s “LGA 1150”,etc) determines which processors you can use with that board. So, if you’ve already narrowed down the kind of processor you want, this is a good first step to narrowing down your motherboard. Look for a model with a socket type that matches your processor to ensure that the two are compatible.

Size: Motherboards generally come in three sizes: Mini ITX, Micro ATX, and full ATX. The more advanced features you need, the larger the motherboard will need to be, which will also determine the size of your case.

Number and Types of External Ports: Look at the ports available on the motherboard. Do you need a lot of USB ports? You’ll either want a motherboard that has them or enough PCI slots to support extra USB adapters. Do you need HDMI out? If you aren’t using a graphics card, make sure your motherboard has the right video output for your monitor. How many USB 3.0 ports do you want? Some have more than others. If you’re set on a motherboard that doesn’t have a feature you need, you can add most with expansion cards, but life is always easier if the motherboard has them built in.

Amount of Supported RAM: If you plan on having a lot of RAM in your machine, you’ll need a motherboard that supports it. Look at how many slots your board has, and how much RAM it allows for.

Integrated Graphics: If all you’re going to do is browse the web, use Microsoft Office, and perform other simple tasks, you may be better off choosing a motherboard with integrated graphics. You only need to shell out for a separate graphics card if you’re playing video games. If you’re getting a separate graphics card, then don't choose motherboard with integrated graphics as this may save some cost.

Number of SATA Ports: This determines how many internal hard drives and optical drives you can have. For most builds, this is only really a concern if you plan on having a lot of drives in your computer (like if you’re building a server or a NAS)..







Number of PCI Slots: You can only have as many expansion cards as you have PCI slots, so if you want a dedicated video card (or two), extra USB ports, extra LAN ports, a Wi-Fi adapter, or other expansion cards, you need to make sure your motherboard has enough of them.







Chipset: Your motherboard’s chipset determines a lot of the more advanced features it has. Some chipsets support overclocking, some do not. Some support SLI and Crossfire (using multiple video cards in tandem), some do not. Others support SSD caching. Others are better for turning into Hackintoshes. If you didn’t understand any of the things I just said, you probably don’t need to pay too close attention to this—but if you want certain advanced features, chipset will narrow your selection considerably.






Generally, the more of these features you require on the motherboard, the larger in size and price they become, so keep that in mind as you ponder.

Brands to Watch For: ASUS, GIGABYTE, and MSI are probably the biggest names in motherboards. However, BIOSTAR and ASRock are well known for good budget boards, if you’re trying to keep the cost down.

, The power supply (or PSU) directs electricity to the other components in your machine. Generally speaking, if you have a high performance computer with a fast processor, a graphics card, and a few hard drives, you’ll need a higher wattage power supply than you would if you were building a low-end PC. This is probably the last component you’ll shop for, once you’ve nailed down your other parts and how much electricity they’ll require (some cases come with their own PSU). The power supply is actually one of the most important choices in your build. This is not an area you want to skimp. Reviews on the net are rarely useful. The best you can do is buy from a good brand (see below) and look for these features:


Wattage: Obviously, if you have a low performance machine, you’ll need fewer watts to power it than you would a high performance machine. Generally, give yourself 100 more watts than what you need, in case you end up upgrading the computer or using that power supply in a later build.

Efficiency: Most units will have a percentage value that denotes how efficient they are. For example, an “80 plus certified” 400W PSU will actually pull something like 500W from your wall. So look for something with a high efficiency, as they’ll run cooler (but they probably won’t save you a ton of money).

Cable Types: Try to look for a “modular” power supply if you can. This means that the cables come detached from the power supply, so you can use only the ones you need and not have the others wasting space in your case. Also make sure it comes with long cables, since cables that are too short can make your life difficult.







Brands to Watch For: This is one area where you don’t want to be thrifty. It’s hard to keep track of all the brands out there, but quality manufacturers include Corsair, Enermax, Enhance, Fortron/Sparkle/FSP Group, Hiper, PC Power & Cooling, Seasonic, SevenTeam, SilenX, XClio, and Zippy. This is one area in which the phrase “you get what you pay for” is very, very true—spend the extra $20 if given the choice; you don’t want to end up skimping and frying a $700 machine in the process.
Note: Many cases actually come with power supplies, so if yours does, you don’t necessarily need to buy one separately. That said, the power supplies you’ll buy separately are usually better than the ones that come with cases, but it’s up to you. It’s just something to watch for when you’re shopping for these two parts.

, Random Access Memory (or RAM for short) stores data your computer needs quick access to. The size determines how fast your programs run, and help you run more programs at one time. Thus, if you run a lot of programs at once, you’ll want a computer with more RAM. If you use virtual machines, you’ll want higher RAM, since it has to run its own programs in addition to yours.RAM seems simple, but you need to make sure it’s compatible with your motherboard. When looking at RAM, think about:



Type of Computer: Since most system now are 64 bit, some older model CPU's are 32 bit, especially if you are buying second hand parts. You must know that 32 bit CPU's can only handle 4 GB of max amount of RAM.

Amount of RAM: At the time of this writing, 4-8GB seems to be the average for a normal machine. If you’re running virtual machines or using other RAM-hungry apps, you might want 8-16GB, but most machines should be fine with around 4GB. Keep in mind that RAM is easy to upgrade, and if your motherboard has four slots, you can always get two sticks now and add two more sticks later. There’s no need to get a ton of RAM now in the name of “futureproofing”.

Channels: Your motherboard will support either dual, triple, or quad channel RAM. This decides how many sticks of RAM you get. If you have a dual channel motherboard, you’ll want to buy RAM in sets of two—for example, two 2GB sticks for a total of 4GB (or four 1GB sticks). Triple channel motherboards take RAM in sets of three, and quad channel is most optimal with a set of four or eight sticks.

Type: Most RAM nowadays is “DDR3”, though DDR4 is starting to pop up. You shouldn’t have to worry about this too much. Just check your motherboard’s spec list to find out what type of RAM it supports and buy accordingly.

Speed: Your motherboard will support a number of different RAM speeds (e.g., “800/1066/1333”). When you buy your RAM, it will have one of these numbers attached to it. RAM speed traditionally doesn’t make a huge difference, but it’s starting to become more useful. Buy what you can afford, and make sure your motherboard supports it.

Brands to Watch For: You won’t find a huge difference between brands. Popular brands include Crucial, Corsair, Kingston, PNY, OCZ, G.Skill, Mushkin, and Patriot. Again, reading reviews of specific sticks of RAM can be very helpful.

, This is a processor specifically designed to handle graphics. Some motherboards come with a GPU already integrated, which is enough to manage your desktop and casual games, but usually not enough for playing latest 3D games. For those, you’ll need a dedicated graphics card and choosing graphics card is one of the hardest parts of the process. If all you need is something that can play HD video, you don’t need to go too crazy—find a well-reviewed card under $100 and call it a day (or just go with integrated graphics). However, if you’re gaming, you have a lot more to think about.


Instead of looking at the specs, it’s usually easier to just read reviews and look at gaming benchmarks. Passmark ranks cards by straight-up performance tests, and Anandtech benchmarks many cards using real-world gaming situations. Think about your budget for a video card, then try to find the best performing card in that price range.
Some manufacturers also factory overclock their cards, which gives them a performance edge over other manufacturer’s version of the same card, so be on the lookout for those. Also be on the lookout for versions with different levels of VRAM. Higher VRAM cards are useful for high resolution or multiple monitor, but are more expensive.

Brands to Watch For: The two main chipset manufacturers are NVIDIA and AMD. The battle between them both is pretty close with each card that comes out. Unless you’re using Linux (for which NVIDIA has better support), worry more about the individual cards than the chipset manufacturer. Go with whatever gives you the best cost to performance ratio at your price point.
When it comes to the card manufacturers themselves, you have a few to choose from. Look for brands with good cooling and good customer support—XFX and EVGA both have pretty fantastic warranties on most of their cards, which is why they’re two of the most popular manufacturers around. MSI tends to have very good cooling. Other popular brands include ASUS, ZOTAC, and Sapphire.

, The kind of hard drive you choose will be determined mainly by how much data you need to store, but certain kinds of hard drives (like solid state drives) can also affect your computer’s speed. When it comes to specs, there are a few things you want to look for in your drives:



Size: Obviously, you want enough space on your hard drive to hold all your data, with room for expansion. Hard drives are pretty cheap and easy to upgrade, so you can always add more later if you’re on a budget.







Speed: The faster your hard drive is, the faster your computer will boot, launch programs, and open files. These days, you get a 7200 RPM drive for relatively cheap price.

Brands to Watch For: Western Digital, Hitachi, Samsung, and Toshiba are all good choices. Seagate is also popular, though it has lately gotten a bad reputation for low reliability. Most hard drive manufacturers have a lot of mixed reviews.

, An optical drive, more commonly known as a CD or DVD drive, is what you’ll use to read CDs, DVDs, and even Blu-Ray discs.

If you’re buying a CD or DVD drive, you probably won’t find a ton of difference between the different models. Most burn discs at around the same speeds. If you’re looking at Blu-Ray drives and Blu-Ray burners, though, pay attention to the read and write speeds. The higher the read speeds, the faster you can rip a Blu-Ray disc, and the faster the write speed on a burner, the faster you can burn a Blu-Ray disc. Obviously, you’ll have to pay more for higher speeds.

Brands to Watch For: It doesn’t make a huge difference who you go with here. Lite-On, Samsung, Sony, and LG are all great manufacturers and the prices should be pretty much the same.

, The case holds all of your computer’s parts together. It is less about features of how your computer runs and more about features that affect you and your home—that is, how quiet it is, how big it is, and how it looks. Still, it’s an important consideration that is dependent on your other choices, so you might want to think about what you want in terms of a case before moving on to the shopping step (some cases come with their own PSU which increase their overall cost, also you might want to check their power rating Watts and how much you require).Your case may not seem like a super important part of your build, but it’s about more than looks. A good case will be easier to build in, last you a long time, and keep your machine cool. Here’s what you’ll need to look for:



Size: Cases come in a number of shapes and sizes, and what size case you choose should match the kind of motherboard you’re buying. If you chose a Mini-ITX motherboard, then a Mini-ITX Tower or Mini-ITX Desktop box is for you. A Micro ATX mini tower is the size you’ll find in most pre-built computers, so know that mid and full towers are probably bigger than what you’re used to.

Airflow: This is something you’ll have to look for in user reviews. Every case is a little different, and the better your fans are placed, the better airflow you’ll have inside (which will keep your computer from overheating).







Noise: While you want good airflow, some fans are particularly loud, which can be annoying to some people. If you want your computer to stay relatively quiet, check the user reviews and see what people say about the case’s loudness.

Number of Drive Bays: If you need more than just a hard drive an optical drive, count the number of drive bays on your case and make sure you have enough. Keep in mind other things, like card readers, will take up drive bays as well. Internal 3.5” drive bays are for hard drives, external 3.5” drive bays are for card readers, and external 5.25” drives are for optical drives (and other stuff).

Ports on the Front: Almost every case you buy will have a number of ports on the front, which usually include a few USB ports, a headphone jack, and a microphone jack. If you want easy access to USB 3.0, for example, you’ll want to make sure it’s on the front of your case.

Cable Management: As you build, you’ll realize there are a lot of cables inside a computer. Unfortunately, if you just leave them hanging where they fall, they’ll block a lot of air from flowing correctly through the case, so you want to organize them as best you can. Some cases have built-in holes through which you can route cables, while some leave you to figure it out yourself with zip ties. The former is, obviously, a lot less work, so see what user reviews say about cable management options.
Keep in mind that a case is something you can use for multiple builds down the road. You don’t need to buy a new case every time you build a computer. Get a quality one now and it should last you two or three computers into the future.

Brands to Watch for: Corsair, NZXT, Antec, and Cooler Master both make some of the best cases on the market. Termaltake, Rosewill, BitFenix, Fractal Design, Silverstone, are also well trusted manufacturers.

, A very good low priced keyboard and mouse can easily be obtained for your daily needs. But if your computer usage is high then getting a bit expensive and ergonomically good mouse and keyboard would be better to get rid of wrist pain or save endless clicks on the scroll wheel, they’re well worth the money.


Speakers, Monitors and other accessories will not be discussed here.

, The process of assembling your own PC is actually very simple in contrast to most people’s expectations. Compared to our researching part section, actual assembly is a much simpler task. Most users are often overwhelmed at the idea of assembling their own PC from scratch. However, over the years, the desktop PC industry has become quite standardized. It’s almost impossible these days to install the individual pieces, cables and connectors in the wrong location. Today the process of assembling a PC is like building Lego which can only fit together in a single way. The guide below can be followed step by step to achieve your goal., You'll need:

A Phillips Head Screwdriver: The only real tool you will need apart from your hands to complete the build successfully. A magnetic screwdriver is always helpful for getting screws in tricky positions and to ensure you don’t drop one in an annoying location to reach.
Cable Ties (optional): Very often cable ties are bundled in with the computer case accessories with the screws. You may want to pick up a pack for cheap if you know your case does not and want a clean cable managed build. An alternative and less permanent solution to this is to reuse twist ties which are often used in component packaging to hold cables together.

,

Static electricity has the potential to do damage to delicate and expensive components. A very commonly asked question is what precautions can be taken and which are necessary. In truth, the vast majority of experienced PC builders do not use grounded wrist straps and similar solutions. They simply take basic precautions such as touching a grounded object (for instance the metal case of a plugged in appliance). Severe Damage may only be evident as BSODs (Blue Screens of Death) in very specific circumstances.

A method some builders use is to plug in to the wall (but not switch on) your new PSU and touch that periodically in order to discharge any static. It is also recommended that don’t build on carpet and avoid wearing socks or loose fitting clothing.


Parts being broken on arrival or breaking in use is a very rare occurrence, however it definitely can happen. For this reason you will want to keep all packaging and boxes for your parts for the length of their warranties (which can be a very long time depending on the component).
Since Motherboards are the first thing to be touched and used a good trick is to place the board on the card box in which motherboard was packed in. This avoids physical damage to the board itself. So lets begin.

,

Take the motherboard out of its protective bag and place it on top of its box (a perfect non-conductive workspace which is the right size to fit the motherboard on). Do not place the motherboard on the anti-static bag it was in as this is not a good work surface and you are better off just using the box as the bag only offers protection when parts are inside of it.
Lift the CPU retention bracket lever from underneath its latch by pushing down and out away from the cpu socket. Bear in mind that depending on the socket of your motherboard, this may vary slightly and referring to the manual that came with the motherboard is advisable.
Unbox your CPU at this stage and remove it from the protective cover.
This is the most nerve racking part of the build. Lift the CPU retention bracket lever to reveal the socket and its pins. These are incredibly delicate and easy to bend (which motherboard manufacturers will not accept an RMA for), so be very careful when working around the socket.
All CPUs have an arrow in one corner corresponding to an arrow printed on or around a corner of the motherboard CPU socket to indicate which way round it fits. The text on the CPU is also an indication of the 'right way up'. In addition to this, Intel CPUs also have notched sides on the upper left and right edges which match up with the shape of the socket. Gently lower the CPU into the socket in the correct position. You should do this so that the CPU stays as horizontal as you can and makes contact with all pins as close to the same time as possible, however there is obviously some room for error. No force needs to be applied at this stage as this is the job of the retention bracket - the CPU should just fit neatly in its place.
Gently lower the bracket over the CPU, sliding it onto the raised pillar on the motherboard.
Push down the retention bracket arm and hook it back under the latch where it was originally. This may take some force, and may even cause some rather worrying noises, however if you have placed the CPU in the correct position in the socket no harm will be done and this process ensures that the CPU is in proper contact with the socket. If you are unsure you can watch detailed video guides to check that you are doing the right thing and applying a normal amount of force.
The protective cover will pop off as you lower the lever. Be sure to keep this in a safe place, as you will need this if you have to send your motherboard back to the manufacturer to protect the socket during shipping. Your CPU is now installed into the motherboard.

,

If you are using an Intel/AMD stock cooler (one which is bundled in the box with the CPU) remove it from the packaging and place the pins in the corners through the holes surrounding the CPU socket (ensuring that the pins at the corners are rotated to an unlocked position by rotating the top of them in the direction of the arrows). After this, turn the top of the pins in the opposite direction to that shown by the arrows to lock it in place. You can check that it is seated correctly by attempting to gently twist it - there should not be any significant movement. Be sure to arrange the fan cable so it doesn’t interfere with the spinning of the fan.
Plug the 4pin PWM fan connector on the end of the wire coming from your CPU fan into the CPU_FAN header on your motherboard at this stage. Watch that the cable isn’t in the way of the fan blade.

,

Next we will be installing the RAM into the motherboard. Read the motherboard manual to find out which slots you should be using for the number of sticks of RAM you have (they are usually color coded and so can be easily referenced). First, pull back the clips on either side of the RAM slots you are going to use.
Notice the clear off-centre notch at a point both on the slot and the RAM stick to indicate which way round the sticks should be placed and ensure they can only be placed one way.
Place each RAM stick in a slot and push down evenly on both sides until the clips engage.

,

Screws and other accessories which are bundled with the case. Find the standoffs for your case. Do not forget the standoffs. Screw the standoffs into the motherboard tray and the screws into that to offset the motherboard from the case and prevent it from shorting out. These sit between your motherboard and the screw in order to stop the motherboard from touching the case and are vitally important. Screwing the standoffs into the case in the locations where your motherboard has a matching hole for a screw.
Install the motherboard I/O shield. This is a metal panel which goes in your motherboard I/O connectors in the cutout at the back of the case. Ensure this is the correct way round. Place the metal panel into the gap at the back of the case and push firmly around the corners and outside edges until it clicks to secure it.
Now take the motherboard and place it in the case. It is best to lie the case on its side as you do this. Lower the motherboard into place. Line up the connectors with the gaps in the I/O panel and push the connectors into the panel before lowering it all the way onto the standoffs. You may need to apply some pressure in the direction of the back of the case to line up the screw holes with the standoffs - this is normal.

,

Connect any 3 pin fan headers from case fans to 3 or 4 pin fan headers on the motherboard. See the motherboard manual if you can't find their location.
A first build can be tempting to not bother to manage cables and that you will 'sort it out another time' but that way it takes more work later or never gets done - so do it now. It ensures that cables do not get in the way, gather dust or obstruct airflow.

,

Next we can move on to the installation of the graphics card. Remove the PCIe blanking plates corresponding to the slot on the case you will be placing your graphics card in. Again, your motherboard manual will assist you in making a decision about which slot to use, but usually you should use the topmost PCIe x16 slot for your graphics card (and you will need to take off another below when you are using a usual dual graphics card).
Press back the clip at the edge of the slot similarly to the RAM slots ready for you to insert the graphics card. Lower the card into position and push down evenly at both ends until the clip engages.
Screw the graphics card in to secure it in place - the graphics card will have holes in it similarly to those on the blanking plates allowing you to screw the card with case.

,

Now things get more fiddly as we begin cabling. First sort out front panel connections before moving on to installing the power supply within the case to keep clutter to a minimum.
Focus on the front panel header connections which will be separate very small wires, with labels on each for switches and LEDs. Pass them through a case cutout to the front of the build (will be hiding cables as much as possible behind the motherboard tray where they are out of sight and do not disrupt airflow).
Connect these cables to the motherboard. Use motherboard manual as each motherboard has a different arrangement of pins on their front panel header (which is why all the cables are separate rather than being bundled into one larger connector). Double check your positives and negatives on LED connections.
After this tedious job is over you will be pleased to know that all the other cables are relatively simple. If your case has front panel audio connections/USB ports the next job will be connecting the 'HD Audio' connector / Front USB connector to the respective header on the motherboard. Again use manual if you are not sure of location of connector.
With all the case connections dealt with we can now focus on a small amount of cable management before proceeding. Make use of cable ties to group cables together and pull the excess behind the motherboard tray.

,

Next we will be inserting the power supply. This simply slides into place above/underneath the motherboard - depending on case design - and will sit against the back of the case. Which way up you place the fan depends on your case and the airflow.

Place and connect the 20/24pin ATX power cable and the 4 or 8pin EPS power cable (which is commonly labelled 'CPU Power') back through the cutouts closest to their headers. The EPS power connector will be at the top of your motherboard near to processor and 20/24pin cable along the edge. In most cases there is a cutout in the upper left corner of the motherboard to route the 4 or 8pin EPS power cable through in order to reduce cable clutter.
Do not plug PCIe connectors into your EPS power connector. This may seem very obvious (8 pin PCIe is differently keyed to 8pin CPU power) but some people connecting a 6 pin PCIe power connector to their 4 pin PCIe power (with 2 pins hanging over the edge). If the number of pins does not match or the connector is impossible to insert for any cable due to keying, it is a safe bet that you are doing it wrong.
Route any required PCIe connectors for your graphics card through the motherboard backplate cutout closest to the graphics card. All PCIe power connectors on the graphics card must be filled by a cable in order to successfully power the card. 8 pin PCIe power connectors from the PSU are often designed to split into 6 pin and a 2 pin optional part - feel free to use just the 6 pin part if you have a graphics card with a 6 pin connector you need to fill leaving the other 2 pins (this step is optional as some low to mid end graphics card do not require extra power connector and draw all needed power through the PCIe connectors). Connect these cables into the graphics card PCIe connectors which will be located at the side or end of the card.

,

Next we will simply be installing a single HDD (some case have tool-less drive mounting so simply slot it into position). Other cases may require inserting drives into caddies using screws or other mechanisms and details of this will be listed in your case manual. HDDs will require a proper mounting solution to minimise vibrations.
Drives, including optical drives in the 5.25"" bay, require two connectors - SATA data and SATA power. Both connectors are ""L"" shaped so you can take a look before connecting it to see the correct orientation. SATA power can require a moderate amount of pressure to plug into stiff connectors. First connect one end of the SATA data cable which will be supplied with your motherboard and/or drive to the drive, and the other to a SATA port on the motherboard. It will usually connect with a satisfying click as the clip engages.
Next, take a SATA power cable from your PSU and connect it to the SATA power connector on the drive (next to SATA data).

, Now you are completely finished with building. Only problem is a lot of excess cabling at the rear side of the motherboard tray. Use cable tie points on the case to secure cables out of sight and route them in a channel along the edge of the tray.

After this place the front and back panels back on the PC and you are ready to go! Enjoy your brand new PC and we hope your experience was a positive one.

,You have finished building a very basic computer!",How to Build a 'Minimalist' Computer," How much are you willing to spend on a computer? If you're willing to spend more than $200, try reading Build a Computer. If you're spending less, then continue to read.;
, Try researching computer hardware online or in libraries. Understand what is necessary and what is not. You need a motherboard, a CPU, heat sync, and compatible memory. You also need a power supply, graphics card, and one drive (probably two). You need cables to mount the drives as well. You also need a keyboard, monitor, and external power cable with which to power on, see, and control your computer. Try looking at the following pictures to know what hardware looks like.

, Make sure everything is compatible. First make sure that you have a motherboard. Then make sure the CPU is compatible, then the memory. Then check to see that the graphics card will fit, and that any other cards (if you want to connect to the internet, ethernet/wireless/modem card) will fit in the slots on the motherboard. So, if you bought an older or even used or refurbished motherboard, you may want PCI and AGP cards, and if it's really old, ISA cards, if it's newer, you may want PCI-Express.Since you're being cheap, make sure that the motherboard supports IDE drives. Then choose a CD-ROM, Floppy, or Hard Drive to go with your computer. You may want to have a Hard Drive with either a CD or Floppy or even all three. If you're simple, all three of these drives together can be pretty cheap.

, Make sure they fit into your budget.

, Try going to your local computer supply store, , , or any other computer wholesale site you know. You can also try looking on a search engine for multiple people selling used parts. Used parts are usually cheaper and, if you're lucky, modded to have better performance.

, These will tell you if you need to move any jumpers on the hardware or install any drivers for them to work properly.

, The case will have holes for stand-offs (where the screws screw into). Make sure you place these stand-offs in the correct position on the case in relation to where the holes are at on the motherboard. A misplaced stand-off can ruin a motherboard if it touches the circuitry.

, You should be careful doing this, since this is pretty much the computer itself.

, Use thermal paste to evenly distribute the heat onto the cooler/heat sink. Having adequate cooling for your CPU is important, a CPU that is not cool will cause an unstable computer and shorten the life of the CPU.

, It saves your BIOS settings including your date and time. If you don't have one then you can visit your local computer store and ask for one.

,, The colorful cables coming from the ATX power supply are the power cables, find the cables that fit the power slot on the motherboard.

, The graphics card is one of the extra cards off of the motherboard. This is the only necessary out of the cards unless your motherboard has one built in. It would be a good idea to plug in any other cards you have as well (again, if it's a web browsing computer, these cards would be your ethernet/wireless/modem cards).

, If you were being cheap you bought IDE drives. Set the IDE pins according to what they are (master/slave drives). If you have a Hard Drive and a CD-ROM, set the Hard Drive to master and CD-ROM to slave. Then mount the floppy drive. It has no pin set, just plug it in. Note that it requires a floppy cable, not an IDE cable. Make sure you flip the cable to the right orientation on all drives.

, Find the corresponding power cables and plug them in to the power slots on the drives.

, Plug in the monitor, keyboard, and power cable. Turn on the computer and enter the BIOS. On most computers, you can enter the BIOS by pressing DEL or one of the function keys (F1, F2, etc.). Tell the computer what you have done. Also set the date and time (if you installed a CMOS battery).

, If you have an operating system on Floppy, be sure to enable boot up floppy seek.

, Follow the onscreen instructions and format the C: drive to a filesystem according to the operating system you are installing. For information on file systems, contact Boidsie.

Take it further.",How to Overclock a CPU," Overclocking is the process of increasing the clock speeds and voltage of your CPU to improve performance. It is a great way to get the most power out of a powerful machine, or unlock a little more power out of a budget or old computer.


Overclocking can damage your components, especially if the hardware is not designed for it or you push the voltages too high. You should only overclock if you are OK with the possibility of destroying your hardware.
No two systems will overclock the same, even if they have the exact same hardware. This is because overclocking is greatly affected by small variances in the manufacturing process. Don't base your expectations solely on the results you read online for the hardware you have.
If you are primarily looking to increase video game performance, you may want to consider overclocking your graphics card instead, as you will likely see better results.
Laptops are not very good candidates for overclocking, as their cooling capabilities are limited. You will get much larger performance increases on a desktop computer where you can control temperatures better.;
, You will need a few benchmarking and stress test tools in order to properly test your overclocking results. These programs test the performance of your processor as well as its ability to maintain that performance over time.


CPU-Z - This is a simple monitor program that will allow you to quickly see your clock speed and voltage in Windows. It doesn't perform any actions, but its an easy-to-use monitor to help ensure everything is working correctly.
Prime95 - This is a free benchmarking program that is widely used for stress testing. This is designed to be run for long periods.
LinX - Another stress testing program. This one is lighter than Prime95, and is good for testing in between each change.

, Different motherboards and processors will have different capabilities when it comes to overclocking. There are also slight differences when it comes to overclocking AMD versus Intel, but the general process is the same. The biggest thing you will be looking for is whether or not your multiplier is unlocked. If the multiplier is locked, you will only be able to adjust the clock speed, which usually yields less results.


Many motherboards are designed for overclocking, and thus should give you full access to the overclocking controls. Check your computer's documentation to determine your motherboard's capabilities.
Some processors are more inclined to successful overclocking than others. For example, the ""K"" line of Intel i7s are designed specifically to be overclocked (e.g. Intel i7-2700K). You can find your processor model by pressing ⊞ Win+Pause and looking in the System section.

, Before you begin overclocking, you'll want to run a stress test using your base settings. This will give you a baseline to compare against as you start overclocking, and will also show if there are any problems with the base in the settings that need to be addressed before overclocking makes them worse.


Be sure to check your temperature levels during the stress test. If your temperatures are above 70 °C (158 °F), you will likely not be able to get much out of overclocking before your temperatures become unsafe. You may need to apply new thermal paste or install a new heatsink.
If your system is crashing during the baseline stress test, then there is likely an issue with the hardware that needs to be sorted out before you begin overclocking. Check your memory to see if there are any errors.

, You will be making the majority of your changes in your computer's BIOS, which is the configuration menu that can be accessed before your operating system is loaded. You can access most BIOS by holding the Del key while the computer is booting up. Other possible setup keys include F10, F2, and F12.


Every BIOS is different, so menu labels and locations may vary from system to system. Don't be afraid to dig through the menu system to find what you need., This menu may be labeled differently, such as ""Overclocking"". This is the menu that you will be spending most of your time in, as it will allow you to adjust the CPU speed as well as the voltage it receives.

, In order to help prevent the memory from causing errors, you'll want to lower the memory bus before continuing. This may be referred to as the ""Memory Multiplier"", ""DDR Memory Frequency"" or ""Memory Ratio"". Lower it to the lowest possible setting.If you cannot find the memory frequency options, try pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 on the BIOS main menu.

, The base clock, also referred to as front side bus or bus speed, is the base speed of your processor. It is typically a lower speed that is multiplied to reach the total core speed. Most processors can handle a quick 10% jump at the start of the process. For example, if the base clock is 100 MHz, and the multiplier is 16, the clock speed is 1.6 GHz. Bumping it up 10% would change the base clock to 110 MHz, and the clock speed to 1.76 GHz.

, Once you've performed your initial 10% raise, restart your computer and boot into your operating system. Start up your LinX and run it through a few cycles. If there are no problems, you're ready to move on. If your system is unstable, you may not be able to get much performance out of the overclock, and you should reset your settings to default.

, Instead of increasing 10% each time, you'll want to reduce your increments to about 5-10 MHz per pass. This will allow you to find a sweet spot much easier. Run a benchmark every time you make an adjustment until you reach an unstable state. The instability is most likely caused by the processor not receiving enough power from the power supply.


If your motherboard does not allow you to adjust the multiplier, then you can skip down to Part 4. If you can adjust your multiplier, then move on to the next section to try to get more gains. Make sure to record the settings you are currently at, in case you want to return to them later.

, Before you start increasing your multiplier, you're going to want to lower your base clock a little. This will help make your multiplier increases more precise. Using a lower base clock and a higher multiplier will lead to a more stable system, but a higher base clock with a lower multiplier will lead to more performance. Finding the perfect balance is the goal.

, Once you've dropped your base clock a bit, start raising your multiplier in 0.5 increments. The multiplier may be called ""CPU Ratio"" or something similar. It may be set to ""Auto"" instead of a number when you first encounter it., Reboot your computer and run your benchmarking program. If your computer doesn't encounter any errors after a few runs through the benchmark, you're good to raise the multiplier again. Repeat this process each time you increase the multiplier another increment.

, Make sure you pay close attention to your temperature levels during this process. You may hit a temperature limit before your system becomes unstable. If this is the case, you may have reached the limits of your overclocking ability. At this point, you should find the best balance between increasing the base clock and increasing the multiplier.


While every CPU has a different safe temperature range, the general rule of thumb is to not allow your CPU to reach the 85 °C (185 °F) level.

, You should now have settings that just barely cause your computer to become unstable. As long as your temperatures are still within safe limits, you can start adjusting the voltage levels to allow further increases.

, This may be referred to as ""Vcore Voltage"". Raising your voltage beyond safe limits can quickly damage your equipment, so this is the most finicky and potentially dangerous part of the overclocking process. Every CPU and motherboard can handle different voltage increases, so pay extra close attention to your temperature.


When raising your core voltage, increase it in 0.025 increments. Any more and you run the risk of jumping too high and damaging your components.

, After your first increase, run a stress test. Since you left your system in an unstable state in the previous section, you are hoping for a stable stress test run. If your system is stable, make sure that temperatures are still at an acceptable level. If the system is still unstable, try lowering either the multiplier or the base clock speed.

, Once you have managed to make your unstable system stable through increasing the voltage, you can go back to increasing either the base clock or the multiplier, depending on which you are trying to overclock. Increase them in the same small increments, running stress tests until your system becomes unstable again.


Since the voltage settings increase temperature the most, your goal should be to maximize the base clock and multiplier settings to get the most performance out of the lowest voltage possible. This will require a lot of trial and error and experimentation as you try different combinations.

, Eventually you will hit a point where you can't get any more increases, or your temperature is nearing unsafe levels. This is the limit of your motherboard and processor, and it is likely that you will not be able to progress past this point.In general, you shouldn't raise your voltage more than 0.4 above its original level, 0.2 if you're using a basic cooling system.
If you reach your temperature limit before you hit a voltage limit, you may be able to eke more increases out by improving the cooling system in your computer. You can install a more powerful heatsink/fan combo or opt for a more expensive but much more effective liquid cooling solution.

, Lower your base clock or multiplier down to the last working settings. This is your new processor speed, and if you're lucky it will be noticeably larger than it was before. As long as everything boots OK, you're ready to start your final test.

, Raise your memory speeds back up towards their initial levels. Do this slowly, stress testing as you go. You may not be able to raise them all the way back to their original levels.


Use Memtest86 to perform memory tests as your raise the frequency back up.

, Open Prime95 and run the test for 12 hours. This may seem like a long time, but your goal is to ensure rock-solid stability at long periods. This will lead to better and more reliable performance. If your system becomes unstable during this test, or your temperatures reach unacceptable levels, you'll need to go back and readjust your clock speed, multiplier, and voltage.


When you open Prime95, select ""Just Stress Testing"". Click Options → Torture Test and set it to ""Small FFT"".
Borderline temperatures are usually OK, since Prime95 pushes your computer more than most programs ever will. You may still want to back your overclock down a notch to be safe. Your idle temperature shouldn't go above 60 °C (140 °F).

, While stress test programs are great for making sure your system is stable, you'll want to make sure that it can handle the randomness of real-life situations. If you're a gamer, start up the most intensive game you have. If you encode video, try encoding a Bluray. Make sure that everything works as it should. It may work even better now!

, This guide only scratches the surfaces of what can be done when it comes to overclocking. If you want to learn more, it really comes down to research and experimentation. There are several communities dedicated to overclocking and its various related fields, such as cooling. Some of the most popular communities include Overclockers.com, Overclock.net, and Tom's Hardware, and all are great places to start searching for more detailed information.

Acquire a power supply that will work for your computer.,
Place your computer case on its side.,
Open the computer case.,
Mount the power supply.,
Plug in the connectors.,
Close your case.,
Turn on your computer.",How to Install a Power Supply," The power supply is what powers all of the components inside of your computer. It will need to provide enough power so that all of the components can function properly. It will also need to have the correct connectors for your hardware.


Make sure that the wattage of the power supply is sufficient for the hardware you have installed. The CPU and the graphics card will draw the most power. If the power supply is not sending out enough power, your computer may run sluggishly or not at all.
Modern hard drives and optical drives require SATA connectors for power. All modern power supplies have these connectors.
Some of the more powerful video cards require two PCI-E connectors. Make sure that your power supply can accommodate everything that you need to connect.
Some cases have non-standard housings for power supply. Ensure that the power supply you purchase will fit in the case. ATX cases should work with all ATX power supplies, and mATX cases will need a mATX power supply.;
, Laying the case on its side will typically provide the best access to the power supply housing. If there is an existing power supply, make sure that it is unplugged before opening the case.

, In order to access the housing, you may need to remove some of your components, such as the CPU fan. This will depend on your case layout.

, Most housings allow you to slide the power supply in, and it will usually only fit one way. Make sure that any fans on the power supply are not blocked, and that you can screw it in from the back with all four screws. If you can’t, then the power supply may be inserted incorrectly.


Mount the power supply securely with all four screws before moving on. You can use standard ATX case screws if the power supply didn’t come with any.

, Once the power supply is secured, you can start wiring the interior of the computer. Take your time to ensure that no component is forgotten, and to place the wires in a way that doesn’t interfere with system fans or cooling. You will likely have more connectors that places to connect to; try to tuck these extra cables out of the way.


Connect the 20/24 pin connector to the motherboard. This is the largest connector on the power supply. Most modern motherboards require the 24-pin connector, while older motherboards will only use the first 20 pins. Some power supplies have a detachable 4-pin connector to make connecting old motherboards easier.
Connect the 12V power to the motherboard. Older motherboards use a 4-pin connector, while newer ones use an 8-pin. This powers the processor, and should be clearly marked on the cable or in your power supply’s documentation.
Connect your graphics card. Mid- and high-end graphics cards will require one or multiple 6- and 8-pin connectors. These will be marked as PCI-E connectors.
Connect your drives. Most drives use SATA power connectors, which are thin plugs. If you have older drives, then you will need to connect via Molex connectors, which are 4 horizontal pins. There are adapters to turn Molex connectors into SATA for older power supplies.

, Once everything is connected, you can close of the case and plug your monitor and peripherals back in. Plug the power supply into the wall and ensure that the switch on the back is set to on.

, If everything is connected and powered properly, the fan on the power supply should turn on and your computer will boot like it normally would. If you hear a beep and nothing happens, then something inside is not connected correctly, or the power supply is not providing enough power to your components."

Locate the damaged area of the wire.,
Unplug from receptacle or switch off at circuit breaker box.,
Discard the damaged area of the wire.

,
Remove insulation from the 2 newly created ends of the wires.,
Form the wires.,
Place heat shrink tubing.,
Align the wires and connect the wires with crimp-type connectors or by twisting.,
Prime the soldering iron.,
Solder the wires.,
Insulate the splice.",How to Splice Wire," The metal conductor of the wire is covered with a plastic insulation coating that should appear smooth. A crack, kink or burn spot on the insulation will be visible at the site of the wire damage;
, Clear the damaged area. Use a standard wire stripping tool to cut both strands of the wire by staggering about 1.5 inch on both sides of the damaged area.


Evaluate the spacing of the cuts. The cuts should be far enough from the damaged area so that the damaged wire is all removed, but as close to the damaged area as possible to avoid cutting away undamaged wire. If the cuts are too wide apart, the wire may not be long enough to make the required connection.

,, Remove about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of insulation from each wire end.


Choose the appropriate wire stripping opening on a standard wire stripping tool. A standard wire stripping tool will have multiple stripping openings. The corresponding wire size to be stripped will be marked on the tool.
Choose an opening cutting for an unknown wire size. If you are not certain of the wire size, pick a cutting opening that will cut fully through the insulation. Ensure that the inner opening is big enough to allow the metal conductor inside the insulation to pass through the cutting operation without being damaged.
Pull the stripping tool down the wire. Affix the tool about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the end of the wire. Hold the tool firmly shut while pulling it down the length of the wire.

, If the wire is made up of many smaller strands twisted together, gently maneuver the strands so they are all laying to form a smooth cylinder. If the wire is a solid conductor wire, this will not be necessary.

, To use heat shrink tubing to insulate the splice, cut off a piece of tubing about twice as long as the area of the splice. Slide it on to the end of either of the wires. Push it up the wire out of the way of the splice so that it is not prematurely heated by the splicing operation.

, Carefully connect the wires so that they remain in line with the rest of the wires, rather than bending up at an angle at the twist joint. A twist joint should have the wires snaking around each other in a line that continues the line of the original wire.

, Place a small amount of solder on the end of the tip of a heated soldering iron. It will become a viscous liquid.

, Gently press the primed tip of the soldering iron on the center of the twisted wires. The wires will heat enough to melt solder.


Apply solder slowly to the wires. Apply enough solder to evenly coat the exposed wire surfaces. Do not get so much solder on the wires that it becomes a mass or ball and prevents you from seeing the wires.
Set the solder joint. Remove the soldering iron from the wires. Keep the wires still until the solder re-solidifies. The solder will dull slightly in shine as this occurs. The solder should set within ten seconds.

,


Set heat shrink tubing. If you used heat shrink tubing to insulate the splice, slide it down over the splice. Using a heat gun, heat the tubing so that it shrinks to fit snugly over the splice. Do not overheat it or the tubing will crack and char.
Wrap the splice in tape. If you did not use heat shrink tubing, cover the splice completely with a helical wrapping of electrical tape

Install the BIX Mount - Note: The BIX Mount must be installed on a 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood backboard that has been treated with a fire retardant product or that has been covered with a fire retardant paint.,





Install the BIX Distribution Rings - Fasten one ring to the top right corner and one ring to the bottom right corner of the mount.,





Mount the 250-pair Cable - Fasten the cable to the BIX mount with nylon tie wraps.,

Strip the cable - The 250-pair cable will have ten (10) Secondary bundles of 25-pairs (50-conductors).,





Fasten each 25-pair bundle - While referring to the colour codes in Figure 5, fasten each 25-pair bundle to a BIX1A connector.,





Seat the conductors - Each conductor will have its own painted colour code.,
Terminate the conductors - The BIX Connecting tool is a device that will cut / trim each conductor to the required length and press each conductor into the BIX1A connector.,





Rotate the BIX Connectors - Each BIX1A connector must now be rotated so that the terminated 25-pair bundles are on the inside of the BIX10A mount.,

Label the BIX10A mount - It is necessary in structured cabling to identify each connection and conductor.,
Document - All telecommunications cabling should be accurately documented and referenced in a spreadsheet form.",How to Terminate a 250 Pair Telecommunications Cable," This is a practice that is mandated by Ontario Building Code. - Fasten the mount to the plywood backboard with two (2) 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) no.8 wood screws. Screw holes are provided on the mount. Use a level to ensure that the mount is squarely installed.
, The rings will snap into place. Next fasten each ring to the backboard with two (2) 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) no.8 wood screws., There are four knock outs on the mount that tie wraps can slide into. Use the right bottom knock out and secure the cable. Leave 1 meter (3.3 ft) of slack on the cable., Each 25-pair bundle will be wrapped in a color coded yarn. Two (2) Primary bundles of five (5) 25-pair bundles will also be wrapped in a color coded yarn. It is important to maintain the bundles so that the conductors can be terminated in the correct sequence. - With a utility knife, score the outside sheath of the cable but make sure not to pierce the sheath and damage the conductors. Use the ripcord to cut the sheath down to the point where the cable is mounted (tie wrapped) to the BIX mount. Carefully remove the sheath and cut it away while maintaining all the twisted pair bundles. Wrap electrical tape around the ends of each bundle to make sure that the color coded yarns that are wrapped around each bundle are not lost., Starting with the first primary bundle (it will wrapped in white yarn), remove the yarn from the first secondary bundle, also wrapped in white yarn. Fasten the ‘white’ bundle to a BIX1A distribution connector with a small nylon tie-wrap. The connector has sleeves for accommodating the tie-wrap. Next proceed with fastening the second secondary bundle (wrapped in red yarn), followed by the third bundle (wrapped in black yarn). Once the ‘white’ primary bundles have been set, proceed with the ‘red’ primary bundle., Again using the colour codes chart in figure 5 slide each conductor into the appropriate slot on the BIX1A connector. The connector should be securely seated into the first slot of the BIX mount. Starting from the left end of the connector, insert the White/Blue conductor into the first slot. Then insert the Blue/White conductor into the second slot. Then insert the White/Orange conductor into the third slot. Continue with each successive conductor until all the conductors of the ‘White’ 25-pair bundle have been seated. Then proceed with ‘red’ 25-pair bundle, followed by the ‘Black’ bundle and so on… Continue until all 250-pairs of conductors have been seated. See figure 7 on how to seat conductors., The BIX connector contains metal sleeves within its casing that make an ‘insulation displacement’ connection. When the BIX tool pushes the insulated conductor into the connector, the connector slices the insulation and makes permanent contact with the copper conductor. Insert the BIX tool into each successive slot and press firmly. The connections are made and excessive conductor lengths are removed., Start with the first connector at the top. Rotate each connector so that the bundles of conductors end up on the underside of the connector. Next rotate the second connector so that the bundle is on the upper side to the connector. Rotate each connector until the bundles are aligned as indicated in Figure 8., The BIX cross-connect system provides a means for identifying each connection. Use appropriate printing software to label each BIX Designation Strip as illustrated in Figure 9., Documentation will indicate the route for the connection paths in the cabling system. This document described the process for terminating a 250-pair cable; the same process will have been performed on the opposite end of the multi-pair cable. As illustrated in figure 9 at the center of each designation label, the opposite end of this cable is “Location B”. Documentation will describe the originating end and the opposite end of each cable in the system. At “location B”, the designation labels will read “250-pair to (Location A)”. Documentation should also describe the function of each cable and the system that they serve."

If you haven't already, remove the cable tube from its packaging.,
Analyze how badly kinked/bent the tube is.",How to Straighten a Plastic Tube Cable Holder1," Remove any labels, tape, plastic wrap, or staples for safety, and to help you straighten the cable tube better.

, Choose a method below, depending on the severity of the bending or kinks.

"
"
Firstly, make sure you have a molex splitter, a biro (disposable pen) that you can remove the ink from, and some pliers.,
Looking at the male end of your molex splitter (you did get a male-female-female cable right?),
Depin the +5v (red) and both of the grounds (black cables).,
Take the black wire closest to the yellow, and put it where the red wire was.

,
Cut free the red and remaining black wire at the female plugs.

,
Plug the cable into your PSU (Power supply unit), and plug the fans into the female ends.

",How to Make a 7 Volt Casefan Line,";
, the red cable is the +5v line, the yellow is the +12v line, and the black are the ground lines.

, To do this, take the ink out of your biro, and slide the hollow end over the pin. This will compress the barbs, and you should hopefully be able to pull the pins out.

,,,"
"
Attach one end of the tube to a ceiling.,
Leave it in this position for a few days.,
Remove the weight after the time you've allocated it.",How to Straighten a Plastic Tube Cable Holder2," Attach the other end to a weight, one that dangles to the floor. In most cases the ceiling height will be high enough to allow the weight to dangle sufficiently.


Use a larger/heavier weight, the more serious the bending.;
, It can even remain like this for up to a week. Just be sure to keep it out of the way of people and pets.

, The kinks should have disappeared. Repeat if needed.

"
"
Stretch out the tube to its full length.,
If available, get a relatively strong, yet thin piece of wood.,
Boil some water on the stove.,
After pouring hot water through once or twice, leave the tube on the wood (or rulers) for 5 to 15 minutes, to allow it to cool.,
Dry off any excess water from the outer side, then (this is more tricky) the inside.",How to Straighten a Plastic Tube Cable Holder3," Notice how all the kinks and bends make it very hard to use.

, This should measure roughly 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) long (other sizes depending on the tube length). Slip this wood down through the tube until it is relatively straight.


A few yardsticks or rulers going lengthwise and half sticking out of the slit works just as well also, but is more hassle and there is a greater chance for the tube to slip. Use rubber bands, if necessary, to hold the rulers if you choose to use them instead of a piece of wood.

, You will not need much, only about 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) of boiling water. (More if you have to repeat this process.) Place the tube with the wood pieces (or rulers) in the bath, the tube situated at an angle as to allow you to pour water down through the tube. This should straighten it, as the hot water makes the plastic pliable, and will straighten to the wood (or rulers). The tube will not shrink, just straighten.

, Once cooled the tube will be straight and a lot easier to work with without the kinks and flexible again.

,


For the outside, toweling it off is easy, the inside is harder to dry through the cable slit. You can take a paper towel, rag or other piece of drying material wrapped on the handle of a spoon or other utensil to get most of the remaining water out.

On the right side there are two power strips placed in opposite directions', a simple security trick to avoid switching the PC absentmindedly,(you have to bend a little further to reach it because the CPU switch is a bit out of the way, almost next to the modem switch). On the contrary, the disks switch is quite at hand, on the right as well. Under the board some cables can be seen linking right and left sides, suspended from open eye bolts inserted in the down side of the countertop.;

. Again, as on the right, an "" always on "", 4 socket power outlet, gives power to an ""off/on"" power strip.







, This power strip is connected to the PC power stripwhich in turn gives power to another switchable power strip where the hard disks adapters are plugged in.As a result you can only switch the hard disks on, if the PC is already working, giving you great ease of use, besides the pilot lamp on the switches will tell you if you forgot switching them off while "" in session"". ON THE LEFT, a square four-socket plug supplies energy to a lamp, to a telephone adapter and to a long power strip which powers the printer and the loudspeakers. Being able to turn them off is a very welcome feature when you want to relax reading to some music background on the headphones.

, What you want is one with room for expansion and lots of cooling options. Thermaltake's Wingo V7420AU1 has some great fan powering with adjustable speeds and supports expansion and water cooling. Lian Li cases are also a good choice. They are made of aluminum and highly expandable.

, PC Power and Cooling Inc. make the most powerful power supplies on the market today. Be cautious of high-wattage, inexpensive power supplies.

, Remember to get RAM that matches the motherboard. (ie, DDR or DDR2, and a compatible speed, which is the PC2-xxxx number)

, When looking for a processor, consider the energy consumption, as manufacturers offer many processors with different power consumption levels. If you are the type that is constantly doing several things on the computer, get a multi-core processor so you can run more applications at once. If you are playing games, a single-core processor will suit your needs better.

, Cooling is what keeps your components from overheating and malfunctioning. Most of the time you will only need fans, but if you are overclocking components to run complex games, you might want to look into more expensive liquid cooling. For the best (but most expensive) cooling, you might want to try submersing you main components in non-conducting mineral oil. Choose copper cooling components for the optimal performance. Remember to get a case that fits the cooling system you choose, as water cooling systems or large heatsinks take up some space.

, This should be the easiest thing to choose. You should already have a good idea of what you need if you have gotten this far. If you are gaming, you may want to look at getting more expensive but higher-speed hard drives to shorten loading times. ""The following are optional and it doesn't matter how many you get as long as they will fit in one machine! You could have a working computer with just the above""

, Just about any DVD-RW drive should do. For gaming, a faster hard drive will speed up loading times slightly.

, Motherboards have integrated video cards but aren't always up to scratch for serious gamers and for Windows Vista or any other operating system that has fancy eye candy. Here, name-brand is probably best so buy something ATI or Nvidia. For the newest games, you might want to get a card that's DirectX 10.

, Although the motherboard has integrated sound as well it won't be likely to give you the clearest sound quality. This is one of the least important things, and will likely be one of the cheapest. If you are going to plug your computer into surround sound speakers, make sure to get a compatible card

, Get a combo floppy/media card reader/writer.

, Try choose a brand-name LCD monitor that has a high resolution and has a low response time.

, If you want to have a wireless network, get a wireless router. Any Netgear/D-link/Linksys router should do. You will also want a USB or PCMCIA WiFi adapter for a laptop, or a PCI one for a desktop computer.

, Most keyboards are the same, except for eye candy. Since usually you aren't staring at the keyboard, splurge somewhere else. A two-button laser mouse is a must, and it should have a decent scroll wheel as well, and probably side buttons.

, You should make sure to only buy what you need, as everything you add will cost extra. If you want to print out hi-res digital pictures on nice glossy paper, get a printer that does that. If you are only printing the occasional word document, don't spend a ton. For a gaming PC, you might not even need a printer at all!

Strip the cable of its protective outside jacket about 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) from the end.,
Stripping the cable can cut and damage the wires at the area that we cut the cable so we want to expose about 6 more inches of fresh wires.,
If your cable has the small string, make a small cut in the jacket of the cable, making sure not to touch any wires, and then use the string to pull towards the fresh end of the cable exposing about 6 inches (15.2 cm) of cable.,

If you look at the back side of your patch panel, you will see the corresponding colors where you will terminate the cable to.

Note: There are two color patterns, T568A and T568B. Make sure to terminate both sides of the cable on the same pattern. If you have already terminated one side of the cable, look to see what pattern was used! If you have not already terminated, choose a standard that you will always use. Both patterns will produce the same results.

, It is general practice to terminate in ascending order so start at the lowest number. First cable should be terminate to the 1st port and so on., Place the wires into the appropriate color slot on the patch panel. Make sure to place the wires as tightly as possible in the slots in regards to the jacket. There should be as little exposed and untwisted wire as possible to keep the signal strength as high as possible. Make sure to place the White/Blue in the White/Blue spot and not the solid Blue spot. The White/Color wire is not the same as the solid color., After all the wires are in the correct spot and double checked to make sure as little amount of exposed wires will be left as possible, use the punch down tool with the 110 blade and terminate each wire individually. The 110 blade will fully cover the wire connector on the patch panel. Push down until the tool clicks and cuts the end of the wire off. Repeat this step if the wire was not fully cut.,,"

Create termination points.,
Insert the cables, one at a time, into a coax stripper tool.,
Clamp the stripping tool around each cable.,
Remove the coax stripping tool from each cable as the strip cut is completed.,
Pull off the outer insulation that has been freed on each cable by the second cut made by the stripping tool.,
Tear off the exposed foil on each cable.,
Bend back the exposed metal mesh on each cable with your fingers.,
Press the end of each cable into the back of an F connector.,
Crimp the connections.,
Complete the splice.",How to Splice Coax Cable,"


Cut off the ends of the coax cables to be spliced. Use small sharp wire cutters. Create squared off surfaces, rather than beveled surfaces.
Mold the ends of the coax using your fingers. Mold the ends of the cables back into cylinders. They will have been distorted by the pressure of the cutting operation.;
, Coax stripper tools are available at hardware and electrical stores. As each cable is inserted, make sure that the end of the cable is seated flush against the wall or guide on the stripping tool. This ensures proper strip lengths.

, Once the tool is in place around the cable, smoothly spin the tool around the cable 4 or 5 times. Keep the rotation in 1 place on each cable. Do not apply any force that would pull on the cable insulation coating.

, The stripping tool made 2 cuts simultaneously. Use your fingers to gently pull off the material nearest the end of each cable. This exposes the bare center conductor of each cable.

, Pull gently with your fingers. This exposes a layer of foil on each cable.

, This will expose a layer of metal mesh on each cable.

, Do not tear the layer of foil that is under the metal mesh. The layer of foil protects the inner insulation. Bend the mesh all the way back so that it is molded over the end of the outer insulation on each cable.

, Make sure that on each connector, the white inner insulation can be seen pressing against the front flange of the connector. It may be necessary to jiggle and continue to push the coax and the connector together to achieve proper seating. Use straight pressure only. Do not twist the coax in the body of the connector.

, Place each F connector into a coax crimping tool, which is available at hardware and electrical stores. Execute the crimp by fully squeezing the crimping tool handle. Release the handle and open the crimping tool. Remove the finished crimp connection from the tool.

, Connect the 2 cables to either end of a BNC female to female coaxial adapter. These are available at hardware and electrical stores.

Face the connection head-on.,
Remember to rotate the connector in a counter-clockwise direction to loosen.

,
Use your hands if at all possible.,
If you must use tools, try to find a coaxial cable wrench.,
If you can't find a coax wrench, the next best option is a pair of small slip-joint pliers (i.e.",How to Unscrew a Coaxial Cable From Audiovisual Equipment," Reaching around the back of the TV or cable box is going to make disconnection of a cable much more difficult. Turn the equipment in question to face you, if need be.;
,, Tools make it very easy to damage the connection port that is attached to the equipment.

, This looks something like a 3 to 4 inch (7.6 to 10.2 cm) octagonal pipe with one side missing. The gap allows you to surround the cable and connector entirely, and unscrew the cable with very little mechanical advantage (i.e. it uses less force and is less likely to damage equipment).

,
Remove 3/4 inches (2 cm) of the audio cable's outer jacket.,
Strip the conductor wires.,
Coat or tin the conductor ends.,
Apply heat shrink wrap.,
Disassemble your RCA ends and keep all components neatly in one place.

,
Slide the outer barrel of the RCA ends onto the cable past the conductor wires.,
Connect the signal conductor to the RCA end.,
Connect the ground connector to the RCA end.,
Thread the outer barrel and the end together.

",How to Make Rca Cables," Do this first so it is hot enough when you begin soldering. Make sure the tip of the iron is not touching anything, and that it is safely out of the way so you do not accidentally bump into it.;
,,


If the cable is too big to fit in one of the gauge holes on a wire cutter, use the sharp edge at the base of the cutters or a pair of scissors.






Apply light pressure with the cutting tool and spin the cable around until you cut all the way through the outer jacket. Be careful to avoid cutting the conductor wires.







, Many cables have 4 conductors. If this is the case, just twist the common colors together.

, Applying a small amount of solder to the twisted ends keeps them together and it easier to connect them to the RCA end.


Heat up the wire and hold the solder on the opposite the iron touching the wire. The heated conductor wire should provide a high enough temperature for the solder to melt and apply an even coat.







, If you plan on making multiple cables for a stereo application, use a different colored shrink wrap for the left and right channel.


Cut a shrink wrap tube about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. Slide the shrink wrap over the the conductor wires onto the cable itself. Let the end of the shrink wrap hang slightly over the end of the cable, but not past the conductor wire tips.






Heat the shrink wrap with a blow dryer.







,, This is necessary in order to be able to screw the end together once you've soldered it.

, Find the U-shaped piece that runs in line with the center pin. Insert the tinned conductor end into the ""U"" and apply the soldering iron to the wire. This will heat up the solder and connect it to the center pin. If necessary, apply a small amount of solder over the top of the wire to assure a solid connection.

, Find the long tab that extends out of the RCA end and has a hole in the center. Insert the tinned ground connector into the hole and apply the soldering iron to the conductor wire. This should be adequate enough to make a solid connection. If needed, apply a small amount of solder on top.

Understand the risks and legality of torrenting.,
Download a torrent client.,
Find torrents of the game you want.,
Check the number of ""seeders"" on a certain torrent to determine it's safety.,
Download the game through a magnet link.,
Click on the ReadMe or Install .txt file in the downloaded game file to finish installing.,
Launch the game by double-clicking it on the desktop or by left-clicking a Quick Launch shortcut.",How to Download PC Games2," Torrenting is a peer-to-peer sharing system, meaning that you can access and download the files on someone else's computer (like a game) as long as they give permission. This means you can download any game imaginable as long as you can find someone hosting it. However, torrenting for paid content, like games, is illegal without the permission of the publisher in many areas. Furthermore, there are many links that are unregulated and could contain viruses. Know that what you are doing is not strictly legal before moving on.


If you've never torrented before, familiarize yourself with the process and risks before moving on.
You still need to check your computer's specifications to make sure your computer can handle the game once downloaded.

, Torrent clients are the programs that pull torrents off the web and convert them into usable files for your computer. There are a variety of free, legal torrent clients out there, such as uTorrent and BitTorrent, that are easily downloaded with an online search.A torrent client is not a torrent -- it is just the program used to download a torrent.

, More often than not you can find these torrents by searching online for ""GAME TITLE + Torrent."" There are a lot of torrent sites out there, and some are more trustworthy than others.


Never give personal information, including name, phone, email, or address, to a site in return for a torrent.
Almost all torrenting sites have some pop-ups and strange advertisements. Make sure that these are not so common that you can't actually read the page.
If you don't trust a site, for any reason, leave., A seeder is another person who torrented the file and is letting others torrent from them. More seeders mean more people trust the file. It can also help to check the comments out at the bottom of the torrent to see if anyone got viruses.There is no ""perfect"" amount of seeders to look for, but more than five is a good start.

, Once you've found the link on a torrenting site you trust, click on ""Download Magnet Link."" This is the safest way to get torrents, as magnet links provide a slight buffer between you and the other person's computer. Click ""Magnet Link"" to open the file in your Torrent Client (like Utorrent).


This download will likely take a long time -- games are huge files and torrenting takes a while unless you have top-quality internet.

, There are going to be specific instructions to finish installing your game once you've downloaded it. The torrent is downloading the game, but not installing it, but it will come with instructions to play it. Sometimes you'll need to use a serial number generator that is attached in the game file. Sometimes you'll need to use a program called Power ISO, easily torrented, to trick your computer into believing it is playing a disc. This process changes from game to game, so you need to find the instructions given and follow them to play your game.


You'll almost always have to use a program called ""Crack"" to get into the game. Again, your installation file will tell you exactly how to use and find it.
If you cannot find this install file, right click on the torrent in your client and choose ""Show in Folder."" You'll see a folder labeled after your torrent containing the .txt file.

,


You may have to download updates the first time you start the game.
Allow your machine to reboot as often as it requires. It may be removing temporary files that are only needed during the installation process.

If you do not own a wrist strap, use any other method of grounding yourself. Just be aware that if you do not ground yourself while working on your PC, you risk damaging your components.;
, Whenever you are working on your PC you should always unplug it from the wall for safety reasons. For this task, it would also be a good idea to unplug everything else as it makes it easier to move the case around.

, This step should be very similar on most cases. Take the thumb screws out of the back and slide both sides of the case off. This will reveal the whole inside of your PC.

, This step will be different for everybody as most people don’t have the exact same hardware. Take a minute to look inside your case and examine the cables that may be cluttering up your case.

, The first thing to do is get all of the cables you need and bring them out of the left side of the PC (behind the motherboard). You will most likely need a motherboard connector, CPU connector, and a PCI-E connector (if you have a dedicated GPU or any other PCI accessories).

, You can now take the cables you just separated and route them through the cable management holes on your case (if you have them) and begin plugging them in. If they are too long, you can tie them up behind the motherboard.

, If you do not have a modular power supply, this will be a critical step for you. After plugging in all of the necessary cables, you can now bring all the cables you aren’t using outside of the case, behind the motherboard.

, Now is the time to zip tie or tape all your cables together. You can tape them up and tape them to the back of the case so you can’t see them when the side panel goes back on.

, Make sure all these cables run neatly to your motherboard.

, Everything should now be nice and tidy inside your PC. You can now put the side panels back on and plug everything back in. Your PC should now run cooler and quieter.

Resistor assortment containing at least nine values of 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10k, 100k, 1M, 10M ohm resistors. In this example, 3 W resistors are used, but 1/4 W or even 1/10 W will be enough as well. Be aware, that using smaller wattage or surface mount resistors will limit the current and voltage. The 1/4 W resistors are easy to solder due to their small size. The 3W resistor set can be bought from eBay for about $12.

Binding posts. In this project, 3 - way audio binding posts are used. They were installed in a house which had wall audio wiring. The wall plates with the binding posts were removed and used here.







A case to hold the switches with resistors and the binding posts. It can be built from wood or any other material.

Tools. Wire, wire strippers, wire cutters, soldering iron, solder, desoldering wick. Needlenose pliers, hemostat or crocodile clips. Drill and drill bits.

Patience. Soldering 72 resistors with about 150 solder joints take some time.

If readings are correct, keep snapping one additional switch into the ganged switches, soldering pin 0 to the common pin.


As shown in the pictures below, the first 5 decades are soldered as mentioned. The last 3 decades are soldered on a small Vero board. The board was then soldered to the switches. For some people it could be an easier way to build this device. Smaller resistors are much simpler to solder directly to the switches. Switches with PCB holes at their terminals instead of the pins would also make life easier.
Finally there should be 8 switches ganged to each other with pin 0 of the previous switch connected to common pin.

First of all, use the right wire.,
Location, location, location.,
Do not just drill a hole in the wall, that will look bad and crumble over time.,
The simplest way to run wire is either up through an attic or down through a basement or crawl space.,
Go up in the attic or down in the basement and look for your coat hangers.,
Once you have drilled your hole start putting wire in it.,
Go to the access hole you cut out and stuff your hand in there until you feel the wire and pull it out.

,
If you don't have an attic or basement, try hiding the wire under the baseboard.,
From here, look up how to hook up a stereo, it is no different with the wires hiding.

,
be sure to respect the black and red colors of your speaker wire.,
So you have a mess of wire at the receiver and you don't know what speaker it goes to?",How to Hook up a Sound System Through Walls," The correct wire for running through the walls will say CM or CMR on it. If you need to go through an air duct be sure the the wire is Plenum or CMP rated. Speaker wire should be 16 gauge, stranded and 2 conductor with one red and one black wire. Do not use your cruddy radio shack copper and aluminum wire, this is not meant for in-wall use. Don't waste your money on Monster cable for your speaker wire; if it is 16 AWG stranded speaker wire from the hardware store it will do just as good as Monster for 1/4th the price.;
, Put your speakers where they need to go and start examining how you could get a wire back to the main receiver. Look for your obstacles like areas that do not have a crawl space below or attic above. Doors between speaker and receiver can limit your options too.

, The right thing to do is buy several 2.5"" x 4"" ""retro rings"" from your local hardware store. These allow you to mount a finished plate over the hole while still providing a large access. You will want to put in a ring at each of the speakers, subwoofer and receiver.

, To do this take a 1/32"" drill bit and drill a small hole straight up (attic) or down (basement) from your speaker and receiver ring location and as close to the wall as possible. Go get an old metal coat hanger, straighten it out and stick into this hole.

, Bring a drill with a 3/4"" drill bit on it. Once you find your hangers move about 2-3"" from that location and drill so you will be drilling into the wall. It is important to remember how far you put the coat hanger from the wall and if you went N, S, E or West.

, If you are in the attic tying a small chain or weight to the wire will help it go all the way down to your ring. If you are going up from the basement, use that same coat hanger to push the wire in.

,, You will be shocked how much room you find between the baseboard and the carpet, you can probably stuff 1 or two wires in there without pulling the baseboard off. You can fit 3-5 if you pull the baseboard, just be sure to put it back up when you are done.

,, If you mess this up your stereo will sound terrible.

, get a AA battery and hook the + to the red wire and the - to the black wire and that speaker will make a small pop noise. If you hooked the speaker up correctly it will push out rather then suck in.

Play your game.",How to Download Highly Compressed Games," Most games that you download will be compressed using advanced archive processes that aren't built-in to Windows. In order to extract the files for these games after downloading them, you'll need a special extraction program. Two of the most popular include 7-Zip (7-zip.org) and WinRAR (rarlab.com).


7-Zip is a free program that can open most compressed files, including RAR and 7z formats. It is the most recommended program for this process.
The trial version of WinRAR will allow you to open most formats forever, but you'll be bugged about registering after the trial period is up.;
, Most games are distributed using BitTorrent, which is a popular method of sharing large files between computers. In order to use BitTorrent, you'll need a client that can load torrent files and connect you to other users. One of the most popular free clients is qBittorrent (qbittorrent.org. If you choose qBittorrent, you won't need to worry about any additional adware. If you choose a different client such as uTorrent, read each installation screen carefully so that you don't install any unwanted software.

, Downloading games using torrents is one of the easiest ways to get infected by a virus. To help prevent against this, make sure that your have an antivirus program installed, and that it is up to date. You can use Windows Defender, which comes installed with Windows, or a third-party solution such as BitDefender or Kaspersky.


See How to Turn on Windows Defender for instructions on enabling it. For instructions on installing a different antivirus program, see How to Install an Antivirus. You should only have one antivirus program installed at a time.
Right-click on your antivirus's icon in the system tray and select ""Update"" to check for and download any available updates.

, Many games come in ISO format, which is a copy of a disc. To use the ISO file, you'll need to either burn it to a disk, or mount it ina virtual drive. If you plan on installing a lot of different games, using a virtual drive can save you a lot of money on blank DVDs.


One of the most popular options is Daemon Tools. Pay attention during installation so that you don't install any unwanted additional software.
Windows 8 and later includes the ability to mount ISO files files without the need of additional software.

, When you use torrents to download files, you'll be loading a torrent file into your client. The client will then connect to other computers that have the same torrent file and begin downloading the actual game files to your computer. The more people that are sharing the file, the faster that you will be able to download it.


You can download highly compressed versions of games from various websites, but this isn't recommended as they've often been stripped of lots of assets to make the file size smaller. With hard drive storage becoming cheaper and cheaper, you'll get a better experience getting a full game from a torrent.

, Torrent trackers are sites that host torrent files. You can use torrent trackers like search engines to find the exact game that you are looking for. The easiest way to find torrent trackers is to simply search for ""torrent tracker"" using your favorite search engine.


Most trackers you'll find through Google are public trackers that anyone can use. If you do some digging, you'll likely come across private trackers. These may allow you to find harder-to-find games, as well as stay out of the spotlight. Private trackers typically require invites from existing users, and almost always make members upload as much as they download.

, Use the torrent tracker to search for the game that you want to download. If it is a more recent release, you'll likely find several options in the search results list. If the game is older, there may only be one or two options, or the game might not be available on that tracker.


It is illegal to download a game that you don't own in most areas.

, The first thing that you want to look at in the results list is the number of ""Seeders"". These are users that have the complete file and are sharing it with others. Not only do more seeders lead to a faster speed, but more users generally indicates that the file works. This is especially important with games, as many are designed with copyright protections to prevent users who didn't purchase the game from playing.

, You'll want to make sure that the torrent includes all of the files you'll need to play the game, including any cracks for bypassing copyright protection. The details section should fill you in on all of the files that the torrent contains. The comments section will help you find out if the torrent has a virus. If several users in the comments are complaining of viruses received from the files, consider avoiding that torrent and looking for a different one.

, The Download link will download a very small torrent file to your computer. opening this file in your client will begin the actual download process. The Magnet link will open your torrent client directly, without downloading the small torrent file first. Either method is fine for loading the torrent.

, The torrent will likely start slowly, but should pick up speed as you connect to more seeders. Depending on the size of the file you are downloading, the number of seeders, and the speed of your connection, the download could take anywhere from a few minutes to several days.

, Some computers and network setups may make it difficult to connect to other torrent users. There are several things you can do to help increase your download speed.Make sure nothing else on your network is using the connection, such as streaming video or gaming. Modern routers will give BitTorrent traffic a low priority on the network if there is anything else using your bandwidth. Ensure that your torrent traffic is the only thing happening on your network if you need the files quickly.
Open the Options menu in your torrent client and select the ""Connection"" section. Check the ""Enable UPnP port mapping"". This will help your client open the correct ports in your router. Your router will need to have UPnP enabled as well. See How to Access a Router for information on opening your router's configuration page.
Put a cap on your Upload rate in the ""Speed"" section of the Options menu. If your torrent is maxing out your upload rate, it will likely slow down the rest of your computer, and can potentially disrupt your download. Set the upload rate to a small number while you're downloading to maximize your speed.

, Run a virus scan after you have finished downloading the files. For many antivirus programs, you can right-click the downloaded file or folder and start a scan. You can also perform a full scan on your computer, though this will take longer. Scanning your files will not guarantee that you'll find any viruses that may be there, but it will increase your chances of finding an infection.

, Most games that you download will come with a README text file. It is highly recommended that you read this file before proceeding with the installation, as many downloaded games require some special steps in order to get them to work.

, If the game came in ISO format, you'll need to mount the file as a virtual disc or burn it to an actual disc to use it. Windows 8 and 10 users can right-click the ISO file and select ""Mount"" to ""insert"" the ISO file into the virtual drive. Windows 7 and later users can burn ISO files by right-clicking the ISO file and selecting burn to disc.


If you can't mount or burn the ISO file, see How to Burn ISO Files to DVD and How to Mount an ISO Image.
Not all downloaded games come in ISO format. You may have a traditional setup file instead.

, Start the installation from the disc, or run the setup file. The process for installing is going to be different for every game. Pay close attention to any installation instructions and make sure to follow the steps exactly. If you don't follow the steps, there's a good chance the game won't work.


During the installation procedure, you may have to run a crack program to bypass copyright protection. Be very careful when running crack programs, as these are by far one of the most common ways that viruses are transmitted.
If you want to be absolutely safe, install the game on a virtual machine first and apply the crack. Monitor the virtual machine for any signs of infection. If the game is clean, then you can install it on your actual computer. See How to Use VMware Workstation for a guide on setting up and using a virtual machine.

, Once the game is installed, you should be able to play it. You'll still need to refer to the README file, as many cracked games will still need you to follow specific steps to start it. This could include running a different executable from the game's directory, or applying a special crack each time you start it.


Remember, software piracy is illegal in most areas. The instructions above should only be used for games that you legally own.

Take the necessary precautions.,
Gather the right tools and supplies.,
Learn about the wires and cables available.,
Find out the proper dimensions and features.,
Choose the correct wire for the project.,
Plan the wire route.,
Routing the wire or cable.",How to Install Multi Conductor Cable Wire," Attempting to install a multi-conductor wiring or cables yourself can involve a fair amount of risk. You can not only damage the area you’re attempting to work on, but you can also cause yourself injury from faulty wiring, especially if there’s electricity running.


If you haven’t previously installed cables and wires yourself, familiarize yourself with the proper tools and skills needed for the project. Any wires you use should meet local building and fire codes. 
If the house you are installing the wire in is still under construction, consult and follow the builder’s safety procedures—especially those having to do with using and storing extension cords and power tools.;
, In order to perform a project successfully, you need to make sure you have the right tools at hand.


For most projects, common tools include hammers, tape measures, small levels, linesman pliers, wire cutters and strippers, and laser levels or chalk lines. Most common drills should be ½” or larger.
You may also need spade bits from ¼” to 1 ½”. Other common tools for a wiring project include step ladders, wire labels, electrical tape, wire ties and attachments, nail plates, junction boxes, and backless brackets or P-rings.

, Multi-conductor cables are designed for a diverse range of communications applications.


These include the common household uses such as audio and video systems, but can also include more advanced applications such as public address systems, actuator controls, remote control circuits, and data transmission. For in-wall installations of speaker and audio/video cables, use UL-rated wire labeled CL2 or CL3. For installing Ethernet cable, use CM, CMR, or CMP wire.

, Multi-conductor cables and wire are usually available in 14 to 24 AWG (American Wire Gauge). They come in a variety of configurations, featuring annealed stranded tinned copper wire, which is RoHS, CSA, and UL compliant.


You can also find insulation in a number of UL styles such as a color coded PVC or with a chrome gray PVC outer jacket that can withstand temperature ranges from (CM) -20°C to 80°C (-4°F to 176°F) and (UL) -40°C to +80°C, depending on what application for which the cable will be used.

, Choosing the right wire is essential for the project. For speaker wire, you need to pick the right gauge for the distance from speaker to amplifier.


If the speaker is less than 80 feet (24.4 m) away from the amplifier, you should use a 16 gauge wire. If it’s between 80 and 200 feet, you should use a 14 gauge wire. For lengths over 200 feet (61.0 m), a 12 gauge wire is recommended.

, Before drilling, make sure that you don’t get too close to AC power wires, since you run the risk of damaging them. Avoid them altogether if you’re running A/V cables. If you have to cross AC and low-voltage wires, make sure they’re at 90° angles.

, When running the wire through the route, drill holes in the center of studs in order to avoid nails, taking care to avoid making large holes in load-bearing walls.


The diameter of the hole should be around twice the size of the total diameter of all the wires you plan to pull through. Avoid running multiple cables through one hole. 
Center all holes vertically in a joist, and avoid drilling holes within 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the top or bottom of the joist. Avoid drilling in support beams or headers.
Roof and floor trusses or I-beams often provide you with “web” space that lets you avoid drilling unnecessary holes.

You can also narrow your search depending on your operating system, since some games may be available on Windows but not Mac, or vice versa, or may be available for other operating systems.
You might also consider narrowing your search by age, since there may be games that are designed more for, say, three-year-olds than one-year-olds. You may have more success finding good games for your child if you search for games recommended specifically for their age.;
, You are sure to get hundreds of different possible options for websites where you can download free toddler games. It is worth spending some time checking out some of these sites to see what kind of products they offer, and whether they fit your needs.

, Many of the sites where you can download toddler games offer user reviews. Look for the sites that have high ratings from previous users, and also browse comments wherever they are available. This will help you decide if a particular game is right for you and your child.

, Follow the directions provided on the website that you choose to download your game of choice.

, Let your child play around with the game, and see if they respond well to it. If so, great. If not, you might want to keep letting them try it for a while before moving on to something else.

, The torrent communications protocol allows users to share large files with one another by breaking the files into small bits or pieces. These pieces are reassembled by a special torrent program upon the completion of a download.

One advantage of torrents is that, if your connection is interrupted, you can basically pick up where you left off in the downloading process later on.
Torrent tracking servers also monitor whether you share your files or merely ""leech"" off of other users. The more you share, the more bandwidth you get. The less you share, the less bandwidth you get.

, A torrent program is a necessary component of the process because it allows you to download all the little pieces making up a torrent movie file.


Torrent files saved from the Web only provide directions to the actual movie file. You need a torrent program to actually locate and download the movie based on those directions.
A few popular torrent programs include:

BitTorrent: http://www.bittorrent.com

uTorrent: http://www.utorrent.com/

Vuze: http://www.vuze.com/

ABC (Another Bittorrent Client): http://pingpong-abc.sourceforge.net/




, After you find the torrent file using one of the methods described in the “Finding Free Movies” section, click on the “save” or “download” hyperlink to save the initial torrent file to your computer. This file will download quickly, but it is not the complete movie.


If using a community torrent searcher, like isoHunt, check the ratings and comments before you download a file. Doing so will let you know if there are any bugs associated with the download.
Another way to tell if the file is a good choice is to check the number of completed downloads. The higher the number, the more promising your results will be.
When you save a torrent file from the Web, you will be saving a text file. This file points to the movie you want to download, and only torrent software can read these files and download the corresponding movie file.

, With your torrent program open, navigate to your torrent file and open it up. This will initiate the actual download of the movie.


When you open the torrent file, the program will read the instructions in the file and locate the file for download
The exact method of opening the file will vary based on the program you use, but usually, it will be as simple as selecting ""Open"" from your ""File"" menu and navigating to the saved file.
Also note that you should specify the location on your computer where you want the final movie file to download to. Otherwise, it will end up in your default download folder.

, The exact speed will vary based on how large the file is and how slow or fast your Internet connection is. You will need the completed torrent to download before you can view the movie on your computer.


This could take a couple of hours with a good Internet connection and plenty of bandwidth. If you do not have much of either one, a feature length movie could take a couple of days to download.

, This is the simplest option. Playing a downloaded movie on your computer only requires you to have a program capable of opening it.


Convert the file if necessary. If you have a program on your computer that can open and play the movie file as is, you do not need to convert it to anything else. If not, though, you will need to convert the movie file to a different extension so that the software on your computer can recognize it.
In order to convert a video file to another format, you will need to download a separate video converter. Many are available as freeware or free trials, but when searching for one to use, make sure that it has good user reviews. Check reviews on a third party website instead of trusting those posted on the freeware's website.
Make sure that the freeware you use can convert the file into a format playable on your computer.

, If you want to watch the movie on your television, you might be able to get a special cable capable of connecting your computer to your television set. This will allows you to play the movie on your television screen as it plays on your computer.


Usually, the cable you need will be an S-cable. Verify that both your TV and computer have the necessary ports to work with an S-cable.

, If you want to watch movies without using your computer, you might need to convert them to another file format using your computer and converter software. After that, you will need to transfer them over to whatever device or tool you want to use.


Watch movies on your cell phone or other portable devices. As long as you have the right software installed and have managed to convert the file into a readable format for that software, you can make your downloaded movie collection even more portable by watching them on your smartphone, iPod, or PSP.
Burn the movie to DVD. If you have a DVD burner and DVD burning software, you can burn a copy of the movie onto DVD for playback on your television.

Visit a music community website.,
Find music.,
Convert streaming music into downloadable files.",How to Download Free Music2," A growing trend in digital music is the use of music streaming websites. Some of the more popular sites are BandCamp and SoundCloud. These sites let artists upload music which visitors can stream and sometimes download.


Not every song on SoundCloud and BandCamp can be downloaded for free. Oftentimes, new releases will have a limited number of free downloads available before you have to purchase the track.
PureVolume offers many free downloads. When you select an album, click the Free MP3 link to download the songs.
NoiseTrade is a music community where artists upload music for fans to download for free. All of the music is completely legal to download.
Last.fm offers lots of free music from a variety of artists.

, You can search by artist or song name, or browse through genres of music looking for new tracks. These sites often feature remixes of popular songs that can be downloaded or streamed for free.


Many artists are starting to release singles and early tracks on sites such as these for free.

, There are several websites that will allow you to enter in the URL of a SoundCloud song and it will convert it into an MP3 file that you can download. Be aware that performing this is against the Terms and Conditions of using SoundCloud.

Go to the front page of your chosen site.,
Sign up, if necessary.,
Browse mixtapes.,
Download a mixtape.",How to Download Free Music3," Mixtapes (in this sense) are albums that remix songs from other artists and/or the artist who makes the tape. Online mixtape communities adhere to standards that keep their mixes above-board, so you can download without fear of legal retribution.


The largest site for directly downloading free mixtapes is DatPiff, which features mostly underground hip-hop and up-and-coming DJs.
Other popular sites include That Mixtape, LiveMixtapes, and MonsterMixtapes.

, Find the area of the page where you can log in to the site. (On DatPiff, it's on the right side of the main page, a little ways from the top.) Click the text that says “Register” and fill in the required information.


These sites make a lot of their money from advertising, and will probably try to get you to sign up for advertising offers during the registration process. Always look for the link that says “no thanks” or something similar to skip these. (On DatPiff.com, it's typically red text in the lower right corner.)

, Read user ratings and comments to find highly-rated ones, or take a gamble on new tapes.

, When you find a mixtape you're interested in, click on “Listen” or “Play” to preview the tape. If you like it, click the “Download” link instead to download it to your computer.


Some mixtape communities set a limit on daily downloads (which you can lift by paying money), but will offer other mixtapes for “free” (which means they don't count against your limit). Browse these first to ensure that you can get as much new music as you want each day.

Find the artists you like.,
Become a fan.,
Keep up with developments.",How to Download Free Music4," Track them down on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and through their website. Become a fan of their social media pages and sign up for their mailing lists.


Do a web search for your favorite artists to find all the different social platforms that they have a presence on. This will ensure that you have the most comprehensive coverage of the artist.

, Many bands and artists have a presence online that you can follow via social networking sites like Facebook, or by joining a mailing list at the artist's personal site. People who show their allegiance to their favorite artists are often rewarded with free downloads of new radio singles, demo versions of songs, rarities, and live session recordings.

, Periodically, the bands you like will let you and other fans know about free sample tracks to download. If you're a fan of enough artists, you might be able to get a new track from a great act each week, completely above board.

Visit free music sites.,
Search for a song.,
Review song data.,
Preview the song.,
Download your file.,
Verify that it works.",How to Download Free Music5," There are a variety of sites and blogs that offer free MP3 downloads. Some blogs offer entire albums before they’re even released. Besides general music sites, there are a wide array of blogs dedicated to specific genres of music.


The vast majority of these sites operate in a legal gray area. For truly legal, free music, look for sites that release music under the Creative Commons license, or host music in the public domain.

, Browse the songs on the front page, or enter a song or artist name into the search bar at the top of the screen to search for specific tracks.


Don't click any of the advertisements. These ads tend to be misleading and can lead to dangerous or intrusive software downloads. Very rarely do they lead to more free music.

, On most sites, song data will be displayed next to each result. Some of the files will display a play time, file size (in Mb), and bitrate. Choose one you like.


Bitrate reflects the audio quality of the file. Generally speaking, mp3 files range from 60 to 320 Kbps, with higher numbers meaning higher quality. CD quality sound is 256 Kbps, radio quality is 192 Kbps.
Lower bitrates will lead to smaller file sizes. This is useful for users that don't have a lot of storage space on their computer or MP3 player, but want to have as much music as possible.

, Click the “Play” link underneath the song title to hear the song in your browser and make sure it's what you want.

, When you're ready to download the song, right-click the “Download” link underneath the song title, and choose “Save as....” Choose a location on your computer and save the file there.


Some sites will link you to download services instead of downloading directly from the website.

, Find the file on your computer and double-click it to open it. Check to be sure the file has downloaded properly. Once you're satisfied, file it and add it to your music player of choice.

Visit a YouTube conversion website.,
Navigate to YouTube and find a song you'd like to download.,
Paste the Video URL into the field of the conversion website and click ""Convert Video"".,
Download the file.,
Double-check the file.",How to Download Free Music6," There are a couple of websites that allow you to enter a YouTube video link into an input field and “rip” the audio track from it for download, usually as a medium-quality (128 Kbps) mp3 file.


Converting YouTube videos violates the site’s Terms of Service. Downloading too often may cause YouTube to ban your IP from accessing any further YouTube content.

, Select your browser's address bar and copy the entire web address (URL) of the video.

, The conversion process may take several minutes, depending on the length of the video file.

, Once the file is ready, it'll appear above the text field. Click the “Download” link to save it to your computer.

, Open it on your computer and make sure there aren't any flaws in it. This was more of an issue with converted mp3s a few years ago than it is today, but it's still prudent to check.

Acquire torrenting software.,
Install your software.,
Download the torrent file.,
Wait for your file to download.,
Consider leaving the torrent up.",How to Download Free Music7," Probably the most popular way to share songs and albums over the Internet is through torrents, which are files that direct your computer to copy bits of a target file or folder (such as an album) from other torrent users until you assemble a complete copy.


This software runs torrent files and helps you manage your torrents. Torrent is a small, fast, and reliable free torrenting program. You can download it at the official website.
While searching for torrents and downloading the torrent file are not illegal, standard copyright laws apply to any content that is transferred through torrents. This means that if you do not legally own a copy of the song you are downloading, that material is considered pirated.

, Double-click on the file you downloaded to run the installer. The installer will most likely want you to install search toolbars and other extra software. You can choose not to install any of it.


Find a torrent. There are many sites that aggregate and list torrents for you to search, since torrent files by themselves aren't illegal.
When you get torrent results, check for user comments or star ratings. Go with the files that have positive comments and ratings – others may be misleading or dangerous.

, This file should be very tiny – only a couple dozen Kb or so at most. This is because the torrent itself is just a set of instructions telling your program what to do. The torrent should open automatically once it has downloaded, otherwise you can open it through your torrent client.

, Torrents can take anywhere from a few minutes to the better part of a day to download. Factors that influence this include how large the file you're torrenting is, and how many “Seeders” (people with the complete file) are currently sharing the file.

, Once you've downloaded your music, you can unpack the files and listen to them at your leisure. At this point, it's considered good etiquette to leave it in your list so that others can download parts of it from you, but you don't have to.


Some private torrenting communities actually require that you maintain a certain ratio of downloading-to-seeding in order to remain a part of the site.

"

Find a community that shares music.,
Keep an eye out for “share” or “sharing” discussions.,
Pick an album.,
Scan for viruses.,
Open the file.,
Provide something in return.",How to Download Free Music8," Most larger community-created websites (such as Reddit) have one or more dedicated music communities. Lurk (observe quietly) and learn the community etiquette before you post.


Sharing music through a forum is no more legal than sharing through torrents. The appeal of using a forum is that they are much less likely to be taken down or pursued by authorities due to the members-only nature of forums.

, Depending on the site you visit, these may happen rarely, or multiple times daily. Once you find one, enter it.

, You'll see people posting albums with hyperlinks to sites like Mega, Zippyshare, and Mediafire. Those links lead to direct downloads of the albums in question.


Copy the link and paste it into a new tab. When prompted, click to download the file.

, Once the file finishes downloading, scan it for viruses with your antivirus software, just in case. This is usually an option in your right-click menu when you click on the file.

, Once everything seems fine, open the file and extract the music files inside. You won't be expected to share it with anyone as you would with a torrent.

, Once you're comfortable with your community, it is fine to ask for music in case other users have it. However, you're likely to get a much better response if you offer to upload an album of your own first.

Install the software.,
Run Soulseek.,
Set a folder of music to share with other users.,
Find and download music.,
Track your progress.,
Add your files to your library.",How to Download Free Music9," File sharing is the act of trading files directly with other users. Soulseek is by far the safest and most reliable file sharing client available for free. It also provides access to one of the widest selections of music anywhere on the Internet.


As with all file sharing programs, be careful downloading files from unknown sources. Programs such as soulseek do not scan for viruses or prevent users from sharing malicious files. It is up to the user to download safely.
Sharing music through a file-sharing program is illegal if you do not own a copy of the music you are downloading. Providing music for others to download also increases potential charges against you. These programs are typically safe because they are community patrolled, but be aware that there is a legal risk in sharing music you do not own.

, The latest version can be found at http://www.soulseekqt.net/news/node/1. Just click the topmost link under the heading for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

, Double-click on the file you downloaded to run it and install the program.

, You'll be asked to create a username for yourself; this doesn't really matter, so pick any name you want.

, Most Soulseek users won't let you download from their libraries unless you share some of your own. You don't necessarily have to share your entire library, although it's considered polite to do so.


Click the Options tab.
Click the File Sharing tab on the Options page.
Click the Share Folder button at the very top of the window.
Navigate to the folder you'd like to share and click “Share.” You can do this as many times as you want, if you'd like to share multiple folders.

, Click the Search tab and enter your search into the text field. Hit enter to see results. Check the bitrate (on the right side of the results) and the file format (MP3, M4A, and FLAC files can all be found on Soulseek), and if you like what you see, double click to download the file(s).


You can sort the list by Transfer Speed to download from users with a fast connection.
To download an entire album at once, double-click the directory above the track listing. You'll download everything in that directory (that is, everything you see in the album folder). Some users do not sort their songs by album, so be careful that you don’t set an entire directory of thousands of songs to download by accident.
Search results update continuously for as long as you leave them open.
Each new search you make opens up a new tab under the search bar. You can close these when you're done with them.

, Click the Transfers tab to see two more tabs, Uploads and Downloads. Downloads shows you what you're currently downloading or waiting in line to download. Uploads shows what files, if any, other users are downloading from your computer.


Light blue text means you're still waiting to download that file. If your entire album list stays light blue for too long, try right-clicking and choosing Retry Download to kick-start it. Most users have a set number of downloads they allow at a time. This means that there is often a line to get the file you want.
Dark blue text indicates the file is currently being downloaded. You'll see a progress bar on the right, as well as a bitrate indicator for the transfer. Higher numbers mean faster downloads.
Green text means the file was successfully downloaded. There will also be a full progress bar next to the file name.
Red text means your download was canceled or aborted. This can happen for many different reasons. Wait until the rest of the songs have finished downloading, and then retry any red downloads before searching for them elsewhere. You can right-click the file and select Retry.

, By default, Soulseek stores your completed music in a folder on your hard drive called “Soulseek downloads,” in a subfolder named “complete.” Once you have the files you want, drag or copy them from the download folder into your music player of choice.

Sketch the design of your sandbox.",How to Sketch Ideas for Your Wiki's Design on Paper," Your topic should be what your wiki is about (and not already taken), and your mission statement should describe your goals for your wiki.;
, It can include one or more featured articles of the day (which almost all wikis have), help pages for the 'newbies,' a button that allows anyone to create an account or log in, and some access to different article categories. You want your wiki's homepage to look creative, and attract readers and community members.

, These should be sets of rules which all of your wiki's contributors must adhere to, including its administrators. Suggestions for policies and guidelines include:



Username policy - Write rules for usernames that can and cannot be created. Usernames that cannot be created can include abusive usernames, names of celebrities and any name that is too long and nonsensical.

Blocking policy - Write rules for when an editor should and shouldn't be blocked. Times when an editor should be blocked include when he/she is part of an edit war, continues to vandalize pages after multiple warnings and repeatedly posts personal attacks and abusive comments to other users.

, Since being a new contributor can be intimidating, and new members of a wiki may have no idea what the wiki is about, they might want to look at help pages. These pages can include a page of frequently asked questions (FAQ) and some guidelines on understanding what the wiki is and is not. You can also provide a tour, which teaches a new contributor how the wiki works.

, This should be a page where any contributor can practice their editing skills, and they can make any edit they wish, except for anything offensive or libelous. Sketch out some guidelines to using the sandbox, including what edits that contributors cannot make, and creating a personal sandbox (a sandbox in a user's userspace).

Have fun!",How to Start a Wiki," Knowing the purpose of your wiki will help decide the software and hosting options to choose from. Wikis can be personal pages, sprawling communities, or anything in between. You can use a wiki to track your life goals, create a product manual for your business, collaborate with coworkers on a project, create a neighborhood newsletter, create a discussion place for a hobby, and much more.


Wikis work best when they have a broad focus that allows as many knowledgeable writers and editors to contribute as possible. If you are trying to build a popular wiki with lots of community involvement, then the focus should be open-ended enough to allow for lots of expanding.
For example, it would be better to start a wiki about a game company and all their games than just one of their games.;
, It would be useless to create a wiki which is a double of another one. The target of a wiki is to write together, not isolate each other. Even if you think the other wiki is slightly different from your concept, if you don't easily adopt the concept of another wiki, why would other people easily adopt your own?, Your wiki will need advice and motivation, so talk about your project and make other people follow you. They are more likely to contribute to the project if they are called before the creation of the wiki as they will feel like co-creators., If you are going to need a lot of control over your wiki, or you want to run your own, you're going to want to host your wiki on your own service. If you don't have any technical experience, a wiki on a wiki farm will be much easier to get up and running, though you won't have as much control over it.


If you foresee your wiki getting very popular with lots of pages and traffic, you may find hosted wikis too limiting. It can also be difficult to get your wiki contents off of a wiki farm's servers so that you can move it to your own later on.Using a wiki farm means that your wiki's URL will have the farm's name in it. For example, if you use Wikia, your wiki's address will be yourwiki.wikia.com. Hosting your own wiki means you can purchase your own domain, making your wiki's address yourwiki.com.
The cost of hosting your own wiki will vary depending on the host that you pick. Be sure to find one that has a good uptime guarantee and high-quality support. Follow this guide for more help on finding your own host.

, Whether picking a wiki farm or going with your own host, you're going to come across several different wiki software packages. Most wiki farms offer whichever software their farm is running, but if you host your own you can use whichever package suits your needs the best. Use services such as WikiMatrixto compare the features of various software packages.



MediaWiki – This is the most popular wiki software on the net, and runs wikiHow, Wikipedia, and many other wiki sites. Many of the most popular wiki farms use the MediaWiki software as well.TikiWiki - This is the second most popular wiki software available, and runs a large number of wikis and wiki farms. TikiWiki has strong plugin support, allowing you to add features such as forums, image galleries, calendars, and more.

UserPress – This is a wiki plugin for WordPress. It has most of the functionality of MediaWiki and other standalone wiki software, but it's much easier to use.

DokuWiki - This is a smaller wiki software program that is growing in popularity, especially in enterprise-level implementations. It is designed first and foremost for team and workgroup collaboration, and has multiple levels of user access., If you decide to go with a wiki farm for your new wiki, you'll need to do some comparisons. There are a lot of options out there, both free and paid. The main benefit of using a farm is the ease of getting your wiki up and running. Be aware that moving to a different farm or to your own server can be very difficult. Some of the more popular farms include:



Wikia – This is a popular entertainment and lifestyle wiki host. Wikia is one of the largest video game wiki farms on the web, and it is also one of the fastest growing wiki farms in other respects.

WikiFoundry – This is an alternative to Wikia and allows for private sites. It is one of the wikis where they can opt to require writer status in order to edit.

Wikispaces – This is a wiki host designed for educational and academic uses. It is very popular in university settings.

Wikispot – This is a host designed for communities and non-profit services, though it is not limited to those. However, as of 30th April 2015, it has discontinued its services in favor of focusing on a geographically-oriented wikis project: LocalWiki.

Wikidot – This is an all-purpose (business, personal, community, education) wiki farm that allows you to use your own purchased domain name with a free Wikidot-hosted account. Wikidot also allows for the creation of web pages beyond wikis.

Miraheze - This is a wiki farm for any purpose needed and with two types of wikis, private and public. MediaWiki extensions can be requested and enabled (including VisualEditor and Flow). There are no ads on Miraheze.

, The process will vary from site to site, but general all you need to do is create a username and then click the ""Create Wiki"" link on the farm's homepage. Some wiki farms require you to fill out a form to be submitted for approval, while others simply ask you for a title and some other basic information.


For step-by-step instructions for creating a Wikia wiki, click here.
For step-by-step instructions for creating a Wikidot page, click here.
Most other farm services are very similar to the two guides posted above.
Once your wiki is created, you can skip down to the next section of this guide.

, Most wiki farms offer a variety of customization options, including premade templates and the ability to upload custom images. Find a template that suits the needs of your wiki, or upload banners and other images to create a unique wiki.


See this guide to learn how to customize a Wikia wiki.

, If you decide you want to host your own wiki, you will most likely need to transfer the wiki software onto the server. Some hosts come with wiki software ready to be installed, but it may not match the software that you want to use (for example, they may offer a quick TikiWiki installation, but you want to use MediaWiki). The following steps are a basic guide to installing MediaWiki, follow this guide for detailed more information, or this guide for TikiWiki information.


The wiki software will come in a compressed file. You can either extract this file on your computer, or extract it on the server.
Place the extracted wiki software folder into the ""web"" directory on your server.
Rename the uploaded folder to what you want the URL to look like. For example, if your website is www.example.com, renaming the folder to ""w"" will make your wiki homepage www.example.com/w/index.php.

, MediaWiki supports MySQL and SQLite. If you are using SQLite, you only need to choose a name for the database and it will be installed automatically. If you are running MySQL, you will need to download it for your server if it is not already installed, and then create a new database using the following commands:create database wikidb;grant index, create, select, insert, update, delete, alter, lock tables on wikidb.* to 'username'@'localhost' identified by 'password';


Replace username and password with the username and password you want to use as the wiki's owner.

localhost Can be left as ""localhost"" unless your database is located on a different server than the web server you're installing your wiki on. In that case, replace localhost with the address of the database's server.
See this guide for more details on creating a MySQL database.

, Once you have the MediaWiki files uploaded and the database has been created, you can visit the index.php page on your server through your browser to run the automated install script. After Mediawiki finishes the configuration tests, you will be asked to fill out a form with your wiki information:Wiki name - This is the name for your wiki. It will show up in the metadata for your wiki, and will be integrated throughout the site.
Contact e-mail - This is the main administrative email address. It will be displayed on all email notifications and on some of the error pages.
Language - Use the drop-down menu to choose the language of the wiki interface.
Copyright and Licenses - Choose your license information. GNU Free Documentation License is the license compatible with Wikipedia.
Admin username and password - This will be the first admin account that can block users from editing and perform other administrative duties. You can create more later.
Database host - This is where the database is located. If it is on the same server as your wiki software, set it to localhost.
Database name - The name of your database.
Database username/password - The username and password used to access the database., Once you've got the base wiki up and running, you can change the visual appearance using user-made skins or by playing around with the CSS code. Change the logo on the wiki to match the function of the wiki.

, Your wiki will come installed with a set of default permissions that may work for your needs, but many people will want to change who can access and edit what. This is especially important in business settings where you want multiple collaborators to work on a product page, but don't want it vandalized by anonymous users.


You can use the permissions file to create different levels of users, such as creating patrol admins who can make edits that don't appear in the recent changes log, or sysops who can merge pages without having to get approval. This will allow you to create a powerful and diverse user base that will keep your wiki running smoothly.

, As soon as your wiki is up and running, it's time to get to work writing articles! When your wiki is born, it won't have any pages and no other contributors. To change this, you'll need to start adding some content. Good content will drive other people to your wiki. As more people come, other visitors will begin contributing their own articles and edits to your wiki. It will take some time, but you'll have a community before you know it!


Remember, when you're starting out, it's up to YOU to create the content that will bring people to your wiki. Be sure that you are well-versed in the topic you are covering so that you can have comprehensive articles available from day one.

, Category pages contain lists of related pages. In addition to categories containing the main content, you may want to create a category page called ""Organization"" for pages of your site like the front page, and maybe create a category page called ""Help"" for the help articles of the site. Remember that categories themselves can have sub-categories by categorizing a category page.

, A policy guide is the general rules for the writing on your wiki. This policy guide will allow other contributors to see how the information on your wiki should be represented to the readers. You don't have to be rigid while creating the policies. Try to make them flexible, as people won't be able to easily work or contribute well to a wiki with overly strict rules.


You may want to write standards on how weaving the web of links should be done, and on article noteworthiness standards.
Not all of your contributors will follow the style guide you create, but it will aid in patrolling and editing articles.
A guide is more friendly than verbally reprimanding. It's more social to be corrected by a text than by a person.

, You will find creating articles much more efficient if you learn some basic wiki syntax. This will let you edit pages directly without having to use any guided editors, which can let you adjust the layout and style to your liking.

, If a content copy is plagiarism, reusing the styles and the templates of other wikis is encouraged. Templates are pages that can easily be appended to other pages. Some uses for templates include nominating articles for deletion, marking an article as a stub, or just simply to note something; but there are a variety of other creative uses for templates. Wikis are open communities that are examples. Look how it works, see how people interacts, reuse their habits and understand why another wiki is successful. Compare your wiki to a wiki with the same size, not Wikipedia. Wikipedia is giant and needs different rules than you.

, The main draw of a wiki is that anyone can edit it, but this is also its biggest challenge. The more people that come to your wiki, the higher your chances of being vandalized. Luckily, almost all wiki software allows for quick rollbacks of articles to their previous versions. Be as much tolerant as possible. If your version and the new version are both correct, prefer the contributor version. It will enlarge the wiki point of view and welcome the contributors.

, If your wiki is interesting, you will find that certain people come back often to create and curate content. If you find that people are enthusiastic about your wiki, then give the dedicated ones more control over the site. Be supportive and nice to your editors. It is important that they have a helping hand to guide them and to motivate them to work on the wiki. By creating admins from your community, you relieve a lot of the pressure that you face when it comes to patrolling and maintaining your content.


Set up forums and talk pages to allow your community members to discuss the wiki's rules and style.
Allow your admins to vote on policy and style changes.
Run community events such as editing competitions to get all your loyal editors excited.

, Do everything you can to spread word about the existence of your wiki. Describe your wiki on wikiindex.org . Search narrow wikis and suggest to point to each other. Your wiki is a node in the wiki network. Do not hesitate to ask questions on the other wikis. The more you talk, the more you will be known. Advertise it through social media, tell everyone you know to tell everyone they know, post in forums related to your wiki, and link it in blog comments. Anything that you can do to get people to visit your site will increase the chances of your wiki succeeding.

, As your wiki becomes more and more popular, continue adding features that benefit your site. Things such as forums, chat rooms, polls, calendars and more can all add good functionality to your wiki. Be creative with your content! Also ensure that you are updating to the newest version of your wiki software package whenever possible to get the latest features and security fixes.

, A wiki is a collaborative, community effort. Enjoy the community that you create with your wiki, and always strive to make it better. The Internet was built in order to facilitate communication and the wiki is currently one of the most effective environments for collecting and sharing information. Congratulations on starting your own!

Restrict the most powerful tools to trusted users with at least some track record or reputation.",How to Prevent Wiki Vandalism," It's said that the best defense is a good offense, and it's certainly true in this case.


The stronger a community a wiki has supporting it, and the more good content it maintains, the less of an impact a few bad edits will have on the overall quality. Good content and good community also serve to set a good example for less experienced editors.
A strong community that is actively maintaining a good content base will naturally tend to defend a wiki against vandals because people do not wish to see their work undone.
A larger community can provide more thorough review. Put another way, many hands make light work. When cleanup tasks are distributed among many people, the cost to any one person of spending time on those tasks is small.;
, Every change to every article gets recorded here. The best time to catch vandalism is when it is fresh. The job of patrolling is easiest when there are many people doing it.


Wikipedia, especially, has developed a number of tools to help with watching Recent Changes more efficiently, including various bots, vandalism watch utilities, and IRC feeds of Recent Changes.

, Think about it as a reward or incentive system. What incentive do contributors have? Volunteer editors are not paid to write, so their rewards have more to do with reputation, friendship, and praise. If contributors can attract more and better attention by creating good edits than by creating bad ones, the good will tend to outweigh the bad.

, It may seem counterintuitive and even counterproductive to bother to warn somebody who just wrote a bad word in place of a good page. However, many edits that may not seem productive at first glance could be worth more than they appear, and editors who are interested enough to try editing may be interested enough to make valuable contributions, too. Consider such examples as these:


Test edits. Many people try editing to see if it will work or to see how it will work. Editors may accidentally leave behind stray marks or parts of coding. Some destructive edits and even bad words are added just to see if anybody is watching. The best approach in these cases is to offer instruction.
Corrections. While it is true that some IP addresses change numbers, spellings of names, and hyperlinks in an article to intentionally add incorrect information, an IP address may make a change that is correct. Check a reliable reference before reverting and consider adding the reference to support the data.
Stub articles. Some people start articles because they want to create an article, but they can't write it. Some starts even include requests for the rest of the article to be added. Think of these not as litter but as seeds. Improve them if possible, or help the person who added them to write more.

, Typically, this means the abilities to roll back or revert edits, delete articles, block disruptive editors, and protect pages. This also means that they must have some latitude for making judgment calls about when to use their powers, within the guidelines and policies of the wiki.

, It can be very frustrating to watch a vandal make a mess and have no recourse but to try to fix it faster than it is created.

, Checkusers are users that have the power to discover the IP address of an account. This is an important function because some vandals use multiple IP addresses or accounts to bypass blocks. Checkusers can identify ""sockpuppet"" accounts (multiple account names made by the same person) and block the underlying IP address(es) if necessary.


Checking the IP address of an editor quickly becomes a privacy concern. Checkusers should never reveal the IP address of an account, nor any more than is necessary to halt disruptive behavior.
Not all sockpuppet accounts are bad. Some good faith editors have sockpuppet accounts because they prefer to keep certain types of edits separate or anonymous, or for test accounts or other functions.
Vandal sockpuppet accounts can often be identified by behavior alone and treated as usual. A checkuser can help if it is a persistent problem.

, If somebody is out of line, it's generally best to tell them that their behavior is not acceptable. Give constructive criticism whenever possible.

, Just as when people write on walls, many vandals do what they do for attention. Don't dwell on the activities of vandals. Just undo malicious edits. Often, paying attention, even if it is lecturing the offender or bemoaning the problem, simply makes matters worse.


It's counterintuitive, but sometimes the best thing to do is to wait to revert. If a vandal gets worse and creates alternate accounts to evade blocks, sometimes it works best to pretend nobody is looking. The lack of attention may be a deterrent.

, Blocks should be used primarily to halt disruptive activities. Be very careful of treating them as punishment. Wikis should have a block policy to guide administrators in the appropriate use of blocks.


Block on user name. If a particular account is causing trouble, block that account. Depending on the wiki, there may be tools built in to prevent users from creating a new account.
Block on IP address. Remember that IP addresses move around and that many are shared or public, as is the case in schools, libraries, and some ISPs.
Set a reasonable expiration. This could be as little as a few minutes, while you get somebody's attention and correct their behavior. A day to a week is often long enough for a first-time offender to decide it is not worth waiting around for the block to end. For persistent vandals a longer block may be warranted.

, For example, Wikipedia keeps a list of the pages that are vandalized the most.

,


Semi-protection means protecting a page against edits from anonymous users.
Full protection means protecting a page against edits from anybody but administrators.
Protection can often be set to expire after a selected amount of time. Protecting a page temporarily can stop an edit war or get somebody's attention long enough to sort things out.
Remember that protecting a page prevents everybody from editing it, not just the problematic users.
Having a few popular pages attract all the attention is not necessarily a bad thing. It can make vandalism and good-faith new editors both easier to monitor. Watching them closely may be the better way to get new editors.

, Link spam (the insertion of URLs into pages in an effort to promote certain sites) is often created using bots from multiple accounts. While these accounts should generally be blocked, the more effective way to put a stop to this sort of vandalism is by prohibiting the links to be posted to the wiki by any account.

, For example, if images are not used in a wiki or are hosted externally, turn off the ability to upload images. Unused features make for extra things to patrol.

, This Wikipedia page tells the following story about giving warnings:



The little boy's mother was off to market. She worried about her boy, who was always up to some mischief. She sternly admonished him, ""Be good. Don't get into trouble. Don't eat all the cabbage. Don't spill all the milk. Don't throw stones at the cow. Don't fall down the well."" The boy had done all of these things on other market days. Hoping to head off new trouble, she added, ""And don't stuff beans up your nose!"" This was a new idea for the boy, who promptly tried it out.








, Share information about vandal activities, open proxies, etc. both within and across projects.

, Some wikis restrict the moving of pages to people with a minimum number of edits, for instance, because this function can be used to do a lot of damage quickly from a newly formed sockpuppet account. Most wikis restrict powers such as deleting pages and blocking users to trusted individuals selected based on their reputation and consistent participation in the community."

If you contribute to three wikis, for instance, you could use dedicate the first three hours of your day to wikiHow, the next three hours of your day to Wikipedia (with computer breaks in between), and you'd use Wikivoyage for the final three hours of your day.;
, For example, you could contribute to wikiHow for your first half hour of your day, and you could switch to Wikivoyage for your second half hour, and then switch to Wikipedia and contribute there for a half hour. You would then repeat the entire process until you have had enough wiki editing for a day.


Note that it might be easier to use one wiki at a time, instead of constantly switching to other ones for a half hour or so. It depends on your personality, though.

, This method ensures that you make contributions, at least on a weekly basis, to all the wiki communities that you are part of, and that you don't ""miss out"" on anything. For instance, if you contribute to wikiHow and Wikipedia frequently, you could contribute to wikiHow every other day, and Wikipedia every other day.

, Connect to your host via FTP and either upload the tar.gz file (if you have control panel or SSH) or the unzipped contents (if you have no way of unzipping it when it's online).

, If you're in a control panel, go to the file manager option (if you have one) and select the 'tarball' (the .tar.gz file). Select the 'unzip' option and then delete the tarball.

Then you can type 'rm <your_tarball_name>.tar.gz' to delete the tarball.

, Usually, when you unzip the tarball, it'll make a folder for the wiki itself, so if you want you can rename it or move it around - maybe even to your root website folder (so going to example.com will head straight to your wiki). Usually at this stage you'll be sent to a set-up or install page.

, One site's wiki-markupis not (necessarily) another site's markup., Your chosen wiki will have an established markup that they use. While pages could be created and rendered differently than wiki-markup, such a choice, more than likely, will confuse potential editors and the browsers displaying the coding.

, An excellent example of markup that is used by most wikis is Wikipedia markup.

, Follow the guide to learn how to reference things and layout (format) the wiki pages for the free Mediawiki.org wiki software which was originally written to use on Wikipedia.org and is used on many hundreds of other sites. Most places want some type of internal uniformity and also a degree of interchange with and portability to other wikis, which Mediawiki provides.

Avoid the mindset that everybody is a total, morally corrupt, jerk.,
Don't appear as condescending.,
Gain respect, then take advantage of it by being a good influence as a member of an online community with a great reputation.~ Avoid participating in not-so-great activities, because other people will see and then follow your wrong path.~ Too many respected people today can not use their ""creds"" of respect to lead people along the right path -- because they're not on the right path themselves!

,

,, Mention that trolling is very dangerous to the other person and, since - as mentioned above - it can pressure kids to harm or kill themselves. But, don't tell your friends that they are just plain mean and selfish. Realize that people probably won't be willing to change their ways, especially if you tell them in a mean way: so be cautious of using your controlling behaviors that may seem like accusations and judging them.

, Calmly influence others to do your respectful implied desires, without telling them directly, and without making them feel threatened, without calling names like ""troller, mean or hater"". Accusing one of ""trolling"" if that person is just expressing honest opinions in discussions is not helpful, and then you have offended him/her and may be dismissed/ignored or called a ""troller, mean or hater"" yourself.

, Such tactics can not influence people to do well because they will be angry and disagreeing with you.

, Don't call them (or imply that they are) silly or childish, for example. Just be thoughtful or kind -- and thank them for cooperating in advance so that you may be influential.

If you're in a meeting and it wouldn't be polite to excuse yourself, focus on listening and understanding.",How to Recognize When You're Getting Argumentative," People draw the line in different places.


The other person may be feeling more emotional, or less, about the topic or how the conversation is going. Don't assume they're being insensitive, uncaring, callous, or thickheaded.;
, Do you feel alone in your opinion? Unacknowledged? Justified? Self-righteous? Attacked? Ignored? Interrupted? A need for vindication, revenge? A need to be heard? A need to interrupt, or stop being interrupted?

, Recognize that your feelings are a perception, and may not paint an accurate picture. Take a breath and eat some humble pie -- try to listen sympathetically. Imagine that this person is your sibling, or someone you care about, and they are sincerely trying to help you see something useful. Treat their ideas as informative and well-meaning. Realize you're human, and remember you've been impolite to others too -- and give them time and be patient. If the relationship is important, this could take hours of listening and controlling your emotions.

, Allow for other opinions, and treat the conversation as an opportunity to learn other viewpoints. Try to be curious and understanding, even if not agreeing.


Do you feel like there's one right answer, and it's a discussion about ""the"" right way? Remind yourself that there might be multiple ways that can work, that you come from different backgrounds and have different experiences. Try to remember to be curious and understanding about how their experiences have informed their opinion -- and resist the urge to share yours as a contrast or correction.

, Again, seek understanding.

, Apologizing (even if you're not wrong) and excusing yourself from the conversation may be appropriate in casual or polite circumstances; Remember, you don't have to prove your point right now. You might be better off listening, and trying to be humble.

, If you leave or ignore the conversation you will miss out on vital information or appear childish. Remember to respect others' opinions and don't expect yourself to convince any one of your opinion. You may be better off asking a humble question than making a statement.

Think about what you really need out of your email host.",How to Choose an Email Service1," If you are a person who needs massive amounts of space, this should accommodate all the large emails you receive. Keep in mind that many large email providers don't last long (e.g. 30gigs is one such email host which was discontinued).

"

If you need lots of space and simplicity, Gmail is the one for you.",How to Choose an Email Service2,"


Gmail continually gives you more space. It is currently offering 10.1 gigabytes of space.
While Gmail is an extremely simple email program, it has a large number of features and 30 different languages, but if you just want to receive and send emails, you can just ignore these options.
Another great thing about Gmail is that you have no banner ads. Only relevant text ads are discreetly shown on the side. It also allows you to search for emails and organize them into as many different folders as you want.
If you are worried about getting junk mail, Gmail is a great way to go.
Gmail allows you to send 20MB of attachments in each email.
Gmail incorporates several brilliant features - RSS feeds, integrated Google search for your mail, labels, conversations, automatically saving drafts (possibly the best feature ever), free auto forwarding, sending email from other email accounts (after verifying that they are yours) and lots more. With the huge space for emails, there's no need to delete emails. You can easily just archive them.
Instead of organizing your inbox into separate emails like other email services, Gmail organizes emails together into conversations, making it so much easier to follow your emails.
Gmail has the best email search ever. With a search bar right up top, you can search every word of every email you've ever sent and received within seconds.
They have also very recently integrated GTalk (a form of instant messaging), which is very popular as well.
The best thing about Gmail is that it's always being improved upon. If you ever have an idea of a better way to do something or a feature that you want to see, it is very easy to contact them and make suggestions. If you have any problems, their help page is extensive and easy to find what you need. If you can't find it, you can email them for help and you're guaranteed to get a response. You're guaranteed to be happy with Gmail.
The interface is spartan, yet still not lacking in features. Generally, GMail loads fastest compared to Windows Live Mail and Yahoo! Mail.
Gmail is also good at reminding you about things you have set in Google Calendar. If you check you Gmail often, a little pop message will remind you on that days date at what time you should do the item.;

If you just need a simple email program to send and receive with few features, choose Yahoo!",How to Choose an Email Service3," Mail.


A lot of people use Yahoo! Mail just for signing up for things they don't want to be spammed by, and since Yahoo! Mail is not JavaScript based, it is faster on most computers.
Yahoo! Mail has a new version in limited beta in which they are turning the interface into a more desktop like one.
One problem is that Yahoo! has large banner ads and adds an advertisement onto your emails, however you can press an arrow which hides them.
Another good things about Yahoo! is that you get unlimited space.

Hotmail is another program.",How to Choose an Email Service4,"


It has features, but a limited amount of space.
It is also a little complicated for the non-computer savvy person. 2MB storage (Note: after 30 days, account storage bumps up to 250MB), signatures, stationary, HTML compatible.
It also has a limited beta version, named Windows Live Mail, that offers 2GB storage, and some good features.(see How to Get a Windows Live Mail Account to learn how to sign up)

Has recently been re-designed. Pop-ups have been removed, storage space has been increased, new anti-spam technology added, there is a ton of new content, it's starting to look a lot like a news portal, which is great if you like that sort of thing.
They do have some nice features. Notepad, calendar, address book, pop3, email forwarding, SMS email (costs money), games...
Overall, it is a good email program but still has room for improvement.

Lycos Offers 5MB of storage, spam fighting tools, HTML composer, domain and address blocking.",How to Choose an Email Service6,"


It is a little harder to understand and use, but it is usable. It has banner ads and blinking lights, but if you don't mind these, it is alright.
It can automatically send an email to anyone who sends you an email. To upgrade to the better version will cost you.

Decide if you want your email address to be your name.,
Get creative if you'd rather not use your name.,
Consider creating a family email address.,
Be prepared to switch up the spelling or add punctuation or numbers.",How to Choose an Email Address," If you're looking for a more professional-sounding email address that you can use for years, sticking with your name is the best way to go. It will be easy for you and your friends/family/coworkers/etc. to remember, and it won't be embarrassing ten years from now. However, if your name is very common (e.g. John Smith), it's very likely that email address has already been taken. If this is the case, you will have to think of something else or add something distinct onto your name, such as numbers, underscores, your middle name or initial, etc. Examples of these potential variations include:


johnsmith65@email.com
john_smith@email.com
smith.j@email.com
johnpsmith@email.com
jp_smith65@email.com;
, If you're concerned about your privacy and would rather not use your real name for your email address, you'll need to get creative to think of an address you can use. Brainstorm a list of things that you like, such as a favorite sport, hobby, pet, TV show, country, celebrity, color, season, etc. Once you've done that, try and find a way to work this into your email address. You may have to mix and match different elements from your list to create your address. Examples of addresses you could come up with using this method include:


purplesoccerball@email.com
math_whiz@email.com
michealjacksonrocks@email.com
american_girl@email.com
autumnleaves@email.com

, If your email address will be used by the whole family and will be receiving emails pertaining to yourself, your partner, your children, etc. you may want to consider making an email address that reflects this. If you're going to do this, some elements you could include in your address could be things like your last name, the number of people in your family, the word ""family"", etc. For example, if your last name was Johnson and you had four people in your family, potential addresses could include:


the_johnsons@email.com
johnsonfamily@email.com
4johnsons@email.com
johnson.fam@email.com

, Because so many people have email addresses, it's very likely that the address you want will have already been taken. Because of this, you'll have to be willing to make some changes in order to create a unique email address that isn't already being used. One way to do this is by changing the spelling, whether it means changing a letter, adding an extra letter, etc. Another way to do this is by adding punctuation, whether it's an underscore or a period. Depending on what email server you're using, some forms of punctuation may not be allowed, so keep this in mind. Another way to make a unique address is to add numbers. If you're going to add numbers, make sure that they're numbers that will be easy for you to remember, such as your favorite number. Examples of these changes include:


Change i_love_music@email.com to i_luv_music@email.com
Change cats.rule@email.com to catz.rule@email.com
Change dolphinlover@email.com to dolphinloverr@email.com
Change janesmith@email.com to jane_smith@email.com
Change janesmith@email.com to janesmith45@email.com

Identify the features that the ideal email client must provide.,
Prioritize those features by arranging them in order of importance.,
Explore support options with each of the clients on your list.,
Compare the features provided by any remaining clients who are considered viable options.,
Test-drive each of the clients that appear to offer everything you need.",How to Choose an Email Client," In order to do this, take the time to make a list of the tasks that are performed regularly when using email as a communication tool. Some common tasks may include the ability to attach images and documents with ease, embed images in the body of the email, easy creation and arrangement of folders and the ability for the client to send and receive emails from multiple addresses. You may also need a client that will deliver mail from a POP3 or IMAP service while still retaining copies that can be directly accessed via the Internet.;
, The first item on the list will be the most frequently used feature, while the last item will be the feature that is used once in a while. Creating a priority list makes it possible to begin evaluating various clients and quickly eliminate any provider that does not currently include those features that are the most important to you.

, While a given email system may look very good at first glance, getting some idea of the level of support you can expect in the event of a user issue is very important. Ideally, any client you consider will provide multiple ways of contacting a service and support team, such as by telephone, instant message or online chat.

, 1 approach is to prepare a spreadsheet that makes it easy to quickly indicate which of the options offer all the features necessary to manage the tasks on your list. Chances are you will find that at least a couple of the clients provide all the features, while others may not currently support 1 or 2 of the tasks you have in mind.

, Since the exact processes involved in using those features may vary, this is your chance to determine which email client is the most user-friendly overall. The goal is to identify the top candidate that has all the bells and whistles you desire while making it easy to use those bells and whistles

Have those moderating the forum help police it.,
Keep your lawyer on hand.",How to Lower the Risks of Defamation in Your Online Forum," Have a lawyer draw up some tight conditions about usage of the forum by both those who post in the forum and those who read it. Things to consider include:


Making it absolutely clear that the website and your company are not responsible for the statements made by third parties using your forum.
Explain that you do not play a role of editing forum content and therefore have no control over what is written there.
Make it clear that defamatory or other legally and morally reprehensible comments won't be tolerated and will be investigated and/or removed.
As part of the terms and conditions, place the onus back on those posting on the forums. Make them responsible for what they post by stating clearly that whatever they post must be true or a genuinely held honest opinion, or similar language depending on the elements that go to making a defamation action in your relevant jurisdiction. Make it clear which jurisdiction of laws your site is operated under, to try to prevent ""legal forum shopping"".
Inform forum users that you retain the right to remove or ban them, either temporarily or permanently, for a breach of these conditions.
Consider requiring users to indemnify you for their comments. That way, if you are sued, you may be able to pursue them for a recovery of costs.
Talk to your lawyer about the extent of these terms and conditions and what the precise content should be to cover you properly. The ability or worth of any one of these conditions is dependent on your jurisdiction and the manner in which your forum works.;
, If you have several forum moderators, give them a list of things you consider require instant removal. As part of this, make it easy for anyone using the forum to be able to contact you, your company, or your staff to make a claim that something defamatory has been printed in it. Let them know that it will be removed if it appears defamatory after an investigation.

, Not all cases of claims of defamatory material or offensive statements will be obvious to you and your team. In addition, you may have defences to claims that something is defamatory, so don't jump over the hot coals straight off. You may need to flick some of them to your legal team to check out and reach a decision on.

Determine who you want to chat with.,
Use direct chat services to talk with friends and family.,
Use browser-based chats to talk with strangers.,
Use a dedicated chat client to connect with communities.",How to Chat Online1," If you're just planning on chatting with friends and family, you'll have different needs than if you want to chat with a community or with strangers. The individuals whom you plan to chat with will help you decide which chat platform(s) to go with.;
, If you plan on doing a lot of one-on-one or group chats with you friends and family, you'll want a program or service that allows you to easily connect with them. Chances are everyone you know has at least one of the following chat programs or services available to them:



Facebook - Facebook is a social networking site that has also turned into a popular chat service. This is a great chat program that most of your friends and family members likely have access to. You can chat through the website on your computer or use the Facebook Messenger app to chat on the go.







Skype - Skype is one of the most popular chat programs in the world, and has millions of users. Skype is available for Windows Mac, Linux, and virtually any mobile device. Skype recently absorbed MSN Messenger. You can use Skype to video chat as well as text chant, and you can create group chats.






Mobile messaging apps - If you spend most of your time on your mobile device, you probably want to chat using it. There are a variety of popular messaging and chat programs available for mobile devices. These include Snapchat, Kik, and WhatsApp. Creating accounts for these apps is free.







AIM - AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) is one of the older chat services that is still incredibly popular. You can chat through the web interface on the AOL website, or you can download the dedicated AIM client.







, There are tons of websites that offer chat services, many of which are aimed at pairing strangers with each other in one-on-one chats. Many of these services offer video chats with strangers as well.



Chatroulette and Omegle are two of the most popular services. You will not have any control over who you chat with. If you have a webcam installed, you can use it for video chat on these sites.
There are a lot of anonymous chat rooms available through website services as well. Yahoo! Chat, Tinychat, Spinchat, and many more offer anonymous chat rooms dedicated to a variety of interests.
Yahoo chat

, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is one of the oldest forms of online chatting around, and is home to thousands of communities dedicated to nearly every subject conceivable. IRC can be a little daunting to new users but it is a very powerful chat protocol that allows you to join countless servers and even transfer files between users.


The most popular IRC client is mIRC. You can also use a chat consolidation program like Trillian or Pidgin to connect to IRC servers.

Know the need for ""netiquette"".,
Treat the person you are chatting with as real.,
Greet people when chatting.,
Don't spam the chat.,
Use conventional capitalization.,
Treat others with the respect you expect.,
Learn to properly use shorthand.,
Fit your grammar to the situation.",How to Chat Online2," Netiquette refers to your interactions with other anonymous users on the internet. Since the internet allows anonymous communication, there is a significant amount of vitriol out there. The number one rule of netiquette is to simply be polite. Without netiquette, the internet will quickly devolve into a completely toxic community filled with trolls and personal attacks.

, Remember, there's another person at the other end of your chat conversation, and what you say can significantly impact someone. Think about how you would talk to someone in person before sending a message.

, A common courtesy is to say ""Hello"" to the chat room you enter or the person your message. This is especially important in chat rooms, as not everyone will notice when new people enter. Saying a greeting will help break the ice and make the chat room a little more welcoming.

, ""Spam"" in chat refers to the act of constantly sending messages to the chat room. Avoid sending messages in rapid succession, and avoid quick, short responses every few seconds. Take some time to formulate your response, and everyone in the chat room will thank you.

, WRITING IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS IS CONSIDERED SHOUTING in the world of online chatting, and will be met with derision and scorn. You will likely be ignored or even kicked from the chat room. Save capitalization for single words or phrases that you really need to emphasize.

, This really applies to everything in life, but is the only way you can expect to have a good conversation online. If you aren't treating other chatters with the respect you expect for yourself, you'll likely be ignored.

, There are endless variations and implementations of internet shorthand, depending largely on the person and the community. Communities develop their own ""dialect"" over time, and using this dialect is a way of fitting in. Improperly trying to apply shorthand can make you appear as an outsider in that community.

, If you're chatting with your boss, you're probably going to use different grammar than when you're chatting with your best friend. Make sure you take the recipient into account when you are formulating your responses.

Choose good, reputable websites to use as sources.,
Begin with the author’s last name, followed by a comma, then the author’s first name, and a period.,
Add the title of the article or text in quotation marks, followed by a comma.,
Add the name of the website in italics, followed by a period.,
Include the date the page was last modified.,
Finish the citation by adding the website, followed by a period.,
Use a similar format to create an in-text citation.,
Begin with the website’s title if you don’t know the author.,
Cite the date you accessed the website if you can’t find the publication date.,
Use a different format to cite a blog post.,
If the website is not a significant source in your paper, be more informal.",How to Cite a Website in Chicago Style," Be careful when you look at websites for research purposes, as you want to always use a reputable site that is not spammy or full of ads. Sites that have an “.edu” or “.gov” domain name are usually reputable and useful sources. You may also want to cite news websites if you are writing on a trending or current topic., For example, if the author’s name is Reg Smith, it would appear in your citation as: “Smith, Reg.” The quotation marks used here are just to note the example; you would not use quotation marks around the author’s name in the citation.

, Use regular (double) quotation marks for this information.


Make sure you use title case capitalization, which is when you capitalize the first and last words in the title, as well as any other important words. Do not capitalize articles like “a” “of” “the” if they appear in the middle of the title.
For example: “Smith, Reg. ‘The Effects of Geothermal Cooling,’”

, For example: “Smith, Reg. ‘The Effects of Geothermal Cooling.’ Renewable Energy Sources.”

, You can usually find this information at the bottom of the webpage or on the top corners of the main webpage.


For example: “Smith, Reg. ‘The Effects of Geothermal Cooling.’ Renewable Energy Sources. Last modified April 12, 2009.”

, The final piece of information to add to the citation is the website. Make sure you use the correct hyperlink notation (http://) and that you put a space after the website so it becomes hyperlinked.


For example:“’Smith, Reg. ‘The Effects of Geothermal Cooling.’ Renewable Energy Sources. Last modified April 12, 2009. http://www.renewableenergysources.com/effects_of_geothermal_cooling.”


, Though you can use a similar format, you will need to change some of the punctuation. For an in-text citation you will turn the author’s name around and change most of the periods to commas. You will also lowercase the word “last”.


Begin by clicking at the end of the sentence you are citing and using your word processing software to add a footnote. The easiest way to add a footnote is to click “Reference” in the ribbon bar and then click on “Insert Footnote.”
Place the citation in the footnote: “Reg Smith, ‘The Effects of Geothermal Cooling,’ Renewable Energy Sources, last modified April 12, 2009. http://www.renewableenergysources.com/effects_of_geothermal_cooling.”


, So, your citation will look like this: “‘The Effects of Geothermal Cooling.’ Renewable Energy Sources. Last modified April 12, 2009. http://www.renewableenergysources.com/effects_of_geothermal_cooling.”, In this case, your modified citation will look like this: “Smith, Reg. ‘The Effects of Geothermal Cooling.’ Renewable Energy Sources. Accessed April 12, 2009. http://www.renewableenergysources.com/effects_of_geothermal_cooling.”, The Chicago style doesn’t have an official stance on most social media, except for blog posts. For a blog post, you will need the blog’s title, the title of the blog entry, and the date the blog entry was posted.


So, if “How to Cool Your Home” is the blog title entry, “Sustainable Energy” is the name of the blog, and the blog entry was posted on April, 25, 2010, the citation would look like this: “Smith, Reg. ‘How to Cool Your Home.’ Sustainable Energy (blog), April 25, 2010, www.suistainableenergy.blogsite.com/howtocoolyourhome.”

, According to The Chicago Manual of Style, you can be more informal about citations for websites that are not major sources in your paper. For an informal citation, you can just mention the name of the site in your text.For example: “As of July 15, 2013, Arby’s notes on its website that the company does not use GMO beef in its products.”
To be safe, always provide more information, rather than less. Whether you are citing a website as major source or a more minor one, start the citation with the author’s name and end with where you found the information (the website’s URL).

Write the way you speak.,
Share details.",How to Write a Blog1," If your aim is to attract readers beyond your friends and family, it's a good idea to pick a genre, however broad, to blog within. Establishing yourself as someone with an interesting opinion on a certain set of topics will keep people who share your interests coming back for more. What's so important in your life that you're drawn to discuss it publicly? People blog about everything under the sun: family, food, cars, professions, the apocalypse, gardening. Think about your own priorities in life and decide where your blog will fall.


Just because you aim to be a ""food blogger"" or a ""fashion blogger"" doesn't mean all of your content will have to be pigeonholed into that specific category. You can be a food blogger who also talks about being a single mom, or a sports blogger who writes about politics occasionally.
Read other blogs that fall into the same genre to get a sense of the community that is already built around that particular topic. Entering the blogosphere is like entering a big group conversation. What are you going to contribute? What's unique about your story?;
, The most compelling writing sounds confident and authoritative, no matter what the topic is. People who take the time to read your writing will want to feel as though they're learning something from you. Offering your expert opinion on an issue, expert tips on how to do something, or expert information not readily available from other sources will make your blog worth reading.


You don't have to have a PhD to sound like an expert. There are already areas in which you have expertise: your own life, for starters. Your taste, your opinions, your experience. Everyone is an expert in something, and blogs are a great way for people to share their knowledge with the world.
Your expertise should come across in your tone. Write in assertive prose, rather than using passive language. Back yourself up with anecdotes, and where appropriate, research.
Consider creative ways to share your knowledge with your readers. You could tell a hilarious story everyone can relate to and learn from, share a tutorial on how to do something you could do with your eyes closed, review little-known musicians or artists who need some promotion, discuss ways to calm down a screaming toddler in a restaurant . . . the possibilities are endless.

, Blogs, unlike most traditional writing forms, tend to be casual, conversational, and relatable. When you're writing a post, it might help to pretend like you're talking to your sister or best friend. Use that same voice in all of your posts so that they feel cohesive and represent you as a person. A common response readers have to popular blogs is that they feel the ""know the person."" When you hit on a tone and style that creates a sense of familiarity with people you've never met, you've struck blogger gold.


Many bloggers have a ""friendly"" relationship to their readers, but there are other forms of familiarity that can also bring success. For example, you could write as though you're a teacher and your readers are your students, spouting inspiring wisdom that keeps them coming back. Find the relationship that works best for you.It can be difficult to use the same words in writing that we use while speaking. If you're unsure how your voice is coming across, try reading your post out loud. Are you able to read it in a natural, relatable way, or does it come off sounding stiff? If the latter is true, go back and change the language and sentence structure to make it sound more conversational.

, Let's be honest: blogging is to writing what reality TV is to television. Like the best reality TV, the most compelling blogs are those that have a lot of juicy personal details. If your blog is too dry and formal, you're going to have trouble keeping readers. Share as much of your life as you're comfortable sharing; you'll build trust with readers and strengthen that ""relationship"" we discussed in the previous step.


How much should you share? A good marker is to share the amount of information you'd share with a pretty good friend who knows you well. Your personality and unique experiences should shine through.
Know your limits and stick to them. There will always be some details you keep to yourself or share only with intimate friends and family members, and that's OK. Once you publish something on the internet, it's hard to take it back, so don't force yourself out of your personal comfort zone.

"
"
Have a topic.,
Write a bold headline.,
Write in short paragraphs.,
Use subheadings and bolded words.,
Consider including a how-to section or list.Many bloggers include some type of tutorial or list as part of their posts, usually with bolded steps.,
Use links.,
Don't forget images.",How to Write a Blog2," Each blog post you write should have a topic, however broad or loose, that the post is built around. Publishing a string of unrelated thoughts might be fine once in a while, but stay away from making every post as unfocused as a daily diary entry. Think of each post as a mini-essay; you've got to have a thesis to keep the post moving and make it interesting enough to read.


The topic can be obvious, like ""My Thoughts on Seeing Wicked for the First Time,"" or it can be a subtle theme that ties the post together unexpectedly at the end. Get creative with your organization and presentation of your thoughts.
Some bloggers like to repeat topics that are popular with readers. For example, you could have a ""Music Monday"" recurring topic where you discuss new music you'd like to share.

, The headline, or title, of your blog post should be devised to draw the reader in immediately. Get creative with your headlines and make them funny, mysterious, arty, surprising, or otherwise extremely interesting. Your headline is the start of your post and will help the reader decide whether or not to keep reading, so it shouldn't be neglected.

, Online writing is characterized by short paragraphs of no more than 3 or 4 sentences, and sometimes fewer. The paragraphs should be broken up with line spaces, rather than indents. This style is much more conducive to online reading, which occurs from the top of the screen to the bottom, rather than from side to side. You'll lose readers if you make it too difficult for them to scan the page quickly., Breaking up the text with subheadings is a good way to prevent your post from seeming like a long, difficult-to-tackle essay. Subheadings are usually written in a bolder, bigger, or entirely different font from the rest of the text, drawing the eye's attention when it might otherwise wander. If you don't want to break your post up into labeled categories with subheadings, consider bolding an important sentence here and there to make the post more visually interesting.


Another way to add visual interest to the post is to play around wit other types of formatting. Bold or italicize individual words, experiment with different font sizes, and use different colors.
This strategy can definitely be taken too far, so make sure you don't overdo it. You want your post to remain readable, and too many fonts or colors could create a visual catastrophe if you aren't careful.

, This gives readers a concrete takeaway and has been shown to keep people on the page longer. Items on a list can also act as a stand-in for subheadings when it comes to breaking up the text to make it more interesting.


If you're including a how-to section, make sure your tutorial is easy to follow as well as entertaining. Don't switch your tone entirely to that of a how-to manual; it should still be written in your voice.
Lists are a good way to organize thoughts that are seemingly disparate. You could write a list of ""5 Ways to Mentally Prepare for the New Year,"" for example, and include 5 funny anecdotes related to things you've been thinking about as the year comes to an end. You've essentially created a structure for your post where before it would have simply been a string of unrelated stories.

, Some bloggers use more links than others, but most sprinkle a few into every post. Linking to other articles is one of the hallmarks of online writing. It's a great way to connect your blog to the greater online world. Linking also makes your writing seem more relevant and up to date - a huge bonus when it comes to attracting readers who check blogs because they want to be in the know on a certain set of topics.


Link to other people's blogs. They'll start linking to yours, too, and you can share each other's traffic.
Link to fascinating items people may not have seen. Readers will start coming to your blog for good information they can't find elsewhere.

, Some bloggers use 8 images for one post, while others use one or even none. Whether you include images in your blog is entirely up to you, but it's worth experimenting with a few to see whether they increase your traffic and make your blog more interesting. Just remember to follow the same rules you follow in your writing: keep the photos relevant, offer something unique, and where appropriate, get personal.


You don't have to use professional-looking photos on your blog; pictures you've taken with the camera on your phone will do just as well in most cases.
If you're starting a blog about food or another topic that works best with pictures, consider investing in a good camera and learning how to edit photos for web use.

"
"
Update your blog often.,
Encourage comments.,
Respond to comments, emails and tweets.,
Pay attention to your audience.",How to Write a Blog3," Blogs are competing with a lot of other content on the web. It's important to stay relevant and up to date to keep readers coming back; otherwise, your blog will get quickly forgotten. Keep yourself in readers' inboxes by updating at least once a week, and ideally more frequently.


When writer's block takes over and you're finding it difficult to come up with consistently great posts, remember that not every post has to be high quality and well thought out. You can update a few times a week with shorter posts or thoughts, just to keep yourself on people's radar.
Updating frequently is especially important when you're first starting out and trying to gain an audience. As you rise in popularity, you'll be less likely to be forgotten after a week or two of no posts.
Publishing a consolidated list of ""favorites"" is a good way to put up a post without actually having to write it. Consider ending the week with a list of links that inspired you, for example.

, The beauty of online writing is that your readers can participate in the conversation in real time. You'll know exactly what people think of your blog, because they'll tell you so in the comments. This type of participation should be encouraged, because it makes people feel welcome to the ""community"" of your blog, creates a sense of friendship and intimacy, and leads to fans spreading the word about your blog to other people.


One way to encourage comments is to ask people questions in your posts. For example, you could end a post about your vacation with the question, ""what's your favorite place to travel?"" When people are encouraged to participate, they usually will.
Be prepared to get some negative or mean comments every once in a while. Try not to take them personally; everyone who has a blog that is read by people other than friends or family is subjected to a troll every once in a while. You can delete the comment or ignore it, it's your choice.

, When you're first starting out, taking the time to correspond with people will help you build a loyal readership by increasing the sense of intimacy people feel with you. Eventually it won't be possible to respond to every single comment or email, but allotting a certain amount of time to the task will pay off in the end.

, If a certain topic or style of blog post seems to be hurting your traffic or inspiring fewer responses, try something new next time. This is not to say you should cater wholly to your readership, but if you aren't offering something that readers like, you'll have trouble getting them to stay with you.

Examine the content of blogs.,
Contrast these features with a website.,
Consider the content that both websites and blogs have in common.,
Decide which works best for you.",How to Tell the Difference Between Blogs and Websites," The following content is fairly typical of a standard blog. They:


Are like daily journals with the most recent data at the top.
Are programmed platforms to allow anyone to easily create a space on the web.
Store older posts in archives.






Also designs come in layouts, or must be done with-in certain boundaries.






Typically do not allow server side scripting.;
, The following website features are different from blogs. They:


Do not make posts, but rather add the data to a page for viewing.
Are written in a code by the website designer educated in that code.
Have unlimited storage on multiple pages that can be viewed on one screen.
Have almost no boundaries to what you can design or create to display.
Require server side scripting to perform more complex tasks.

, They:

Can be written in Html Code for certain portions of what is displayed.
Are viable means of keeping an audience up-to-date on a particular subject.
Are the basic content of the web.
Can be hosted under a domain name of your choice providing it is available.

, Some things to keep in mind when deciding include:

If you know very little about HTML you will want to use a blog.
If you're looking for free hosting, be sure you have php support.
Learn HTML, PHP, and Ajax these are the basic building blocks of websites and invaluable to know when on the web.

Plan what you want to make.,
Install Drupal.

,
In a browser, go to the URL for your new Drupal installation.,
Familiarize yourself with the administrative dashboard.,
Install the modules your website will require.,
Install the theme for your website.,
Create the structural components of the website.,
Create the menus and views to allow your website visitors to navigate through the nodes.,
Put together the components.,
Add your content.,
Polish and test everything.,
Launch your website (make your website live on the internet).",How to Set up Drupal," Making a website (or web app) can take a lot of time and effort, so spending time planning what you want to do, which will reduce how long it takes and improve the quality of the finished product, makes a lot of sense.
Begin your planning by deciding on the purpose of the website, and who it's for - think about the kinds of people who will visit it, then deciding what content it will need to have, and finally how you'd like to structure it (what content goes where, and on which pages).;
,, This will run the install script which will first gather the information it needs from you and then setup all the database tables. I recommend using the standard installation profile, not the minimal one. Once finished, your website will be ready to use!

, Located above the pages, the administrative dashboard allows you to add content, add users, configure the structure, modify the appearance, install modules, and more.

, Modules for Drupal are special PHP plugins that add extra functionality to the CMS, such as webforms and image manipulation. Installing modules is very easy in Drupal. Just click on Add Modules in the Modules section of the administrative dashboard. Unlike other CMSs, there is usually one module per feature that is always free and well supported instead of several different modules to choose from that may or may not cost money and be what you need. Visit www.drupal.org to find modules.



Views, probably the most commonly-installed module, allows you to create complex lists, grids, or tables of any of your content (or users or comments).

Drupal Commerce is a e-commerce module which allows you to sell products and services through a Drupal website, and it handles product creation, shopping cart management, and ordering. It replaced the trusty Ubercart module.

Lightbox and Colorbox modules allow you to create complex image galleries.
Both WYSIWYG and CKeditor modules replace the plain text editor with a rich-text, WYSIWYG editor.

Webforms allows you to create forms such as a contact form or a contest submission.
Many, many more modules exist for pretty much any task.

, The theme is the component that determines the look and structure of the web pages. You can build your own theme starting from a base theme such as Zen or Omega, or you can use a mostly finished theme such as Danland or Corporate Clean. Either way, you're encouraged to modify the CSS and PHP files of the theme to achieve the exact design you're looking for. www.drupal.org has many free themes available for download. Theme marketplaces provide polished, ready-to-use themes for around $30 to $70.

, Before actually adding your content, create the content types, views, menus, and taxonomies your website will depend on.


The 'Content-Types' component lets you define the structure of each type of content, such as whether or not an image should accompany the text or if users can post comments. Chances are, you will not get it right the first time. Don't worry, changing the content-type updates any content of that type.
The 'Blocks' section lets you define what content blocks go in what regions of the webpage, such as footer, sidebar, etc.
'Taxonomies' act as tools for creating lists of categories, sections, tags and the like, and they can also build complex structure trees for, as an example, a product catalog or music library.

,


'Nodes' are pieces of content, defined by the Content Types.
'Menus' provide the means for navigation to the static content, such as pages for About Us, Contact, etc, and to any Views that list the dynamic content.
'Views' is the module for creating tables, slideshows, and lists of other nodes in the website for creating ""splash"" pages that link to your content. Not all websites need views, only ones with content that is frequently added like blog posts or products. Configuring the views can be quit complex: there are fields to add, filters for selecting what content to display, settings to control the content display, a 'paging' feature for creating multiple pages of content within one view, and more. Drupal beginners are advised to read through the Views documentation.
Existing views can be cloned. For example, if you have a view for a page that displays blog posts, it can be cloned and the filter can be updated to only displays news articles.

, This is where some forward thinking is needed. For instance, should two content types be created, one for local news and one for national news in this example, or should there just be one general news content type paired with a taxonomy that lists both types? The answer to that depends on more deciding factors: will one have different fields than the other, such as a field for location? Should different user types (admin, author, editor) be able to create one and not the other? Could different news types be added in the future, such as global news or community news? These are questions that will have to be addressed. Some does and don'ts:


Do use taxonomy terms over creating multiple content types, when possible.
Don't attempt to make a view of views. If you find yourself needing this, you're approaching it wrong. Taxonomy terms can be organized into a hierarchy, which should be able to help in a situation like this.
Do search for modules out there that will do all this hard work for you. For example, the Calendar module can create views that turn into full-featured calendars which would be nearly impossible to do on your own. And the Station module creates content types and views to build a radio station website, complete with playlists and schedules. There are such things as 'Profiles' that can be installed that can perform similar tasks.

, Once the structure has been configured (or at least created) you can add the content, or write new content.


You can create menu links to the content or you can rely on them being displayed in the views.
You can name your own URL aliases for the content, making them easier to link to.
Some content types, such as Ubercart product classes, have special fields such as SKU numbers and prices.

, Thorough testing, editing, and polishing is a must before releasing the website to the public. Make sure that permission levels are where you need them (like not letting anonymous users modify pages) and test the website in several different browsers and platforms.

, Once everything is ready, make the Drupal website live by connecting it to a domain name and spreading the word, just like any other website.

Decide on the kind of photography you want to focus on.,
Choose your brand name.,
Design your logo.,
Organise your portfolio.,
Prepare your media.,
Buy your domain name and hosting account.,
Choose a Wordpress theme.,
Once you choose your theme and have installed it, t's time to get your website published.,
Install plugins.,
Add your Menu.,
Your photography site is now armed with the industries top tools and all you need to get your site off the ground.,
Create your portfolio.,
Decide on whether to watermark your pictures or not.,
Get feedback on your site.,
Pat yourself on the shoulder, you just created the single most important element of your business, your website.",How to Set Up a Photographer's Website," Know your photography genre well and be good at it because it will dictate the style your site will have.


Wedding photographers tend to focus their entire graphics, copy text, logo design etc towards this niche market. You should dedicate yourself to familiarizing yourself with the genre you wish to work with.
If you are a general photographer, choose your overall style that best resonates with you and represents your identity. Do you want a minimal approach, or want to go big and bold? Your website is your online business card so spend enough time exploring online inspirations and coming up with your own identity.;
, Your brand is your key identifier and will help your customers find you on the web.


Note that choosing your brand name will dictate your domain name so choose it wisely. For instance do you want to brand yourself with your full name? Your first name with photography at the end? Or use keywords? This choice is totally up to you.
Do a quick search on Google to find some inspiration.
Consider using your own name for your brand. However the drawback to using your own name is that could take time for your name to come up on the first page of Google simply because people don't know you yet and more likely to search for keywords like ""Houston photographer"" and domains which includes these keywords will most likely show up first. But once you build a network of clients and backlinks Google will soon start placing you higher in search results. Whether you use your business name, full personal name or targeted keywords, make sure you stick with it because it will be much harder in the future to change it.

, If you're not into Photoshop, the best thing to do is go on eLance or Freelancer.com and choose a designer to do your logo. This should save you lots of time allowing you to concentrate on other areas of creating your website.

, Once you've chosen your logo, spend the rest of the week preparing your media. These are your banners, headings and any kind of graphics you'll need on your site. Also make sure you organise your portfolio on your computer per sub-genre for example: Portraits, Landscapes, Wildlife etc. This could save you time when searching for that great picture you took to showcase on your front page slider. A well organised website starts with a well organised desktop.

, If you want to promote an offer, design its banner now. If you want to include a Newsletter on your website, consider creating the header graphics. Once you're ready to create your content, these will come in handy to fill in the gaps and give your site that extra visual oomph.

, Your domain name is the address people will click on to get to your site. Your hosting server is where all the folders and files of your website will live. There are a huge amount of domain registrars out there, but choose a cheap but reputable company with great support.


If you register your domain with a different site than your hosting account make sure your Nameservers point to your account. If you don't want to worry about this just choose one company for both your domain and hosting accounts.
On the welcome email, click on the cpanel link and install Wordpress. Before installing Wordpress make sure you choose the www option and leave the install root folder field empty (delete wp). That's it! You're ready to roll and the fun now begins.

, As your logo design, the theme is the first thing people see when they visit your site. Wordpress is the platform, sort of like the basis of your home. The wordpress theme is the design layer that dresses your site, like the walls and decorations in your home. There are lots of choices here, from free to premium, each with its own pros and cons. There are plenty of free wordpress themes that are suitable for photographers. You can either install a theme from within wordpress themes page, or download one from any website and upload it to wordpress. Free designs are usually not so great if you're a perfectionist or want a very specific look, you might need to look at paid options. These usually come packed with features and options and look usually much better, hence make you look more professional. You can find some really great themes at Themeforest or Elegant Themes. Just Google ""wordpress themes"" and get ready to get inspired. Add the word ""free"" to look at free wordpress designs. Whatever you pick make sure it matches your photography genre, your logo and the colour palette you prefer.

, You can either click on Posts, Pages and delete the built in content that comes with the theme and create your own content, or use the template pages to create your own.


Go to Settings > General enter your site title, email address and pick your other options.
Go to Settings > Reading and choose whether your front page will display your latest posts or a specific page. Choose your pages here. If you haven't created any page yet, go create one now and choose it here later. Experiment with the other options here as well.
The Settings > Discussion regulates what happens when people comment on your posts. Read each option carefully and choose whatever suits you.
Go to Settings > Permalinks. This is an important step because it tells wordpress how you want your links formatted.
Go to Users > Your profile and fill in your details. Some themes allow author boxes which will be pulled from these entries.
Go to your Theme options and customise your appearance. These usually include uploading your logo and favicon, posting your Analytics code, choose blog style options and sidebar placements and other html/css options. Each theme offers different options so make sure you navigate all your themes options to customise the appearance of your site.

, A plugin is a piece of software code that complements your theme and offers extra features that will help boost your site's performance, content and appearance. There are literally hundreds of thousands of plugins to choose from so it is first better to experiment with your theme's options first then decide what you still need.


You can either look for options on the wordpress.org site, download and install the plugin manually, or install your plugins from within your wordpress admin. Just click on Plugins > Add new and search for whatever you need. You can choose to install social plugins to boost your social media features of your site to make it more shareable, or choose new sliders, cool photo galleries or even expand the potential of your site by installing ecommerce plugins to turn your site into an online shop.For instance some themes come with Instagram widgets some don't, some come with Contact Form 7 some don't. So go to your Plugins when you first install your theme and see what you still need and build as you go.
Advanced Lazy Load. This plugin loads the images in your post based on user scrolling, which helps speed your page's load time.
Bookly. If you need an online photography booking system.
Broken Link Checker. As the name says, it regularly checks your site for broken links. Useful when you start making changes to internal links within your posts.
Bulk resize media. Resize images to help speed up your site.
Google XML sitemaps. Use this to create a sitemap for your site, a file that google bots love to find when they crawl your site. Then use it to submit your sitemap to Google Webmaster Tools.
Gzip Ninja Speed Compression. Compresses your page and unzips it automatically when user visits your site to speed up your site even more.
Incoming Links. Great to find out who's linking to your site.
iThemes Security. This is a must have plugin. It will lock down your site to potential hackers, spammers and attackers. Gigantic amount of options so i won't post them here.
Any newsletter plugin like MailChimp, Aweber, Constant Contact etc.
No Right Click Images. Very cool plugin to forbid users to right click on your images when they navigate your site. When users do it will show them a custom image to let them know your image is protected.
SEO friendly images. Automatically adds Alt and title attributes to your images.
Share aholic. Or any other social sharing/following plugin. Essential plugins to add sharing capabilities to your pages and posts. Very customizable and free.
W3 Total Cache. One of the best website performance plugins out there.
Wordpress SEO by Yoast. One of the must have plugins as well. This is an all in one solution for wordpress. It even includes on page analytics and gives you a score and suggestions to improve your score.

, Define what is important for your customers and build your menu. Assign your menu to your theme's allowed locations. These will probably be: About, Bookings, External links, Portfolio, Contact etc.

, Build pages to add more info about who you are, create a blog page and choose Blog from the template option on the right of the Blog editing page and make sure this page is assigned to be your Blog in Settings > Reading. Write a few (3 to 4) blog posts so your blog don't show empty. These could be anything from How you started your photographer career, a post about your gear, a few tips for mothers looking for a newborn photographer etc. Adding a blog to your site is great as it will show you're an authority in your field and increases the chance of being hired. A blog also increases your search engine score as it shows Google your site is an active and dynamic website that offers targeted content to readers looking for that specific information. Don't forget to update your blog regularly with 1 to 2 posts per week.

, This is the single most important element of any photography website. Choose your best of the best images and organise them in categories. Don't post each and every picture you took at that event. This is your 10 sec selling line. This is what sets you ahead of the competition. Your portfolio will tell your potential customers why you're better than the rest. Your portfolio will get you hired.

, This is totally up to you but most experienced photographers do not include watermarks, simply because your image is protected by default by law at time of creation. So whether your picture is watermarked or not it won't really matter, especially if you have installed the No right click plugin. Watermarks are essential in the open realm of the internet, outside of your website. Watermark all your pictures that go on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, simply because their privacy policy usually includes clauses (that we normally don't read) that allows them to use your photograph in any way they wish. So always watermark your images that you post on social media. If you do not wish to watermark the images, upload images with a very small resolution which will make it difficult for people to use the images for printing.

, Once you're happy with the look and feel of your site you can submit it to Concept Feedback. Many people will be happy to have a look and provide you with an objective review of your photography site.

, In today's world your business simply does not exist if you don't have a website, or even worse, have a bad one. So here's to all your hard work and countless hours of creativity, sweat and dedication.

Think about your blog's angle when designing your page.,
Choose a short, memorable name.,
Plan when and how you can post while abroad, and let your reader know.",How to Start a Travel Blog1," There are a number of great platforms where you can build a good looking website free of charge. You can use Tumblr, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Weebly, and many others. To get an idea of which one to use, visit the site and search for ""Travel."" You can then peer through other travel blogs hosted on the same site and see what styles you enjoy.


While almost all blogging sites offer a free version, the also offer paid packages that allow you to upload videos and music, host more pictures, and gain access to a wide variety of customization options. If you plan on blogging after more than one trip, you will likely need professional options
If you're looking to be a professional travel writer, you should consider buying your own domain name. Having a site URL like www.myadventures.wordpress.com is fine for smaller blogs, but it looks a lot less professional than www.myadventures.com.;
, What makes your blog stand out amongst the thousands of other travel blogs out there? Establish a style and stick to it. Try to pick up on a new trend or become an authoritative guide on something people really want to know about. Think about your reasons for writing a blog -- what do you want the world to know? Whatever makes you and your trip unique needs to be in your blog to be successful.


Is your blog just meant to keep friends and family in the loop about your travels, or do you hope to reach a wider audience?
What kind of perspective do you bring to a new place or country? Are you a foodie looking to compare different recipes. A tourist out of her element in a new culture? A photographer looking to capture something new?
What can you teach people from your trip? Are you an inventive budgeter, a student of music or poetry, or a camping guru?, All blogging sites come with ""Templates,"" which are pre-made websites that allow you to focus on the content, not coding. That said, you need to choose a design that best showcases your talents and travels. Remember, you can always change this later, too, if your blog changes focus.



Pictures: If you plan on using a lot of photos, choose a layout that offers lots of pictures on the screen at once. Many of them have a homepage or top bar with slideshows or a collage of your pictures, making them front and center for your viewers. Often, these templates show off big, high quality photos.

Essays: Look for a very minimal design, something that is easy to read and doesn't distract viewers from the words on the page.

Mixtures: If you plan on posting a bit of everything, consider a simple, scrolling design. These usually give small clips of pictures or text in chronological order, with the latest post up top, allowing your viewer to scroll through and get an idea of what each post is about., Usually, the name includes your location, but if you plan on multiple trips you should get a more general name. Puns, plays on words, and alliteration (using the same letter twice, such as ""Timmy's Travels"") are generally safe bets, but choose a name that speaks to you. Keep it short so that it is easily memorized and people know how to look you up.Try to avoid hyphens, numbers, and odd symbols or spellings whenever possible.
For ease of memory make sure your URL and name are the same.

, Before you leave, check out your accommodations and determine when you'll be able to post something. Blogging shouldn't be the end all be all of the trip. If you're not able to post frequently or need to cut your experiences short to run to an internet cafe, you may not get the most out of your trip. However, a bit of pre-planning can save yourself the hassle:


Know when you will have time to write, and let people know your ""posting days.""
When out of service, write multiple posts. You can then schedule them all when you're back in internet range. Learning how to use your site's ""Schedule Post"" allows you to write many posts at once, then put them up every few days. This is perfect if you'll be leaving service again."

Make an enjoyable trip your first priority.,
Brainstorm ideas for posts based on your experience, but not about you.,
Write or post every few days.,
Diversify your posts.,
Add visuals, music, and imagery.,
Use social media accounts to promote your blog.,
Comment on other related blogs.",How to Start a Travel Blog2," You can't write engaging, enjoyable content if you're not engaged with your trip. The best writing comes out of experience, but you can't get that experience if you're always holed up on your computer or looking through a camera lens. Set aside time for writing, but move on to other things when that time is over.


Oftentimes, writing is best at the very end of the day, right before bed, or right when you wake up. You'll be able to reflect on the day you just had, then move on to the next one., This is the fine line of travel writing. While all of it is going to be personal (you did experience it, after all) your writing can't be so personal that it reads like a journal. You need to find ways to tackle the subjects that will illuminate or enlighten your readers. Find ways to put the viewer next to you on your adventures, making them feel like they are traveling too. For example:


Dedicate posts to describing cultural differences, like a post on food, a post on public transportation, a post on morning rituals, etc.
Dive deeply into one specific area, like a neighborhood, restaurant, friend you've met, or hidden location.
Teach your readers how to do something, like how to plan their own trip, how to dress like a native, how to order at a restaurant, etc.

, The more you write, the better you will get it. Even better, frequently updated sites will appear more often in search engines, and viewers are likely to keep coming back if they can be sure there will be new content waiting for them.


Make a deadline for yourself, such as a new post every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Your viewers will know when to check in and you will be more likely to stick to a regular writing schedule., While you want to stay on your general theme, mixing up your posts here and there is a great way to keep your readers, and yourself, interested. If you normally write essays, post a funny personal story or a photo collage. If you're mostly focusing on food and recipes, take a day and go into a market or grocery store, or interview a cook about their method of cooking. The best part is that expanding your horizons like this will make the actual travel more enjoyable, as you'll peer into unexpected corners and cultures. Some other ideas include:


Throw in a personal essay, explaining who you are to readers and your thoughts, once in a while.
Teach your reader a new skill you've picked up.
Ask a friend or new acquaintance their thoughts on your own culture.

, Even if you're not a great photographer, a few pictures in every article captures people's imaginations and makes them likely to stop and read. A page filled with nothing but words is intimidating, but the same content with 2-3 pictures mixed in seems much more appealing.


Take some video of great events or post a link to a song you heard. Engage the reader as much as possible so that they feel like they're on your trip with you.
Link out to new music you find to expand your readers boundaries.

, If you're a writer, send out tweets with your thoughts and links to the blogs. If you're a photographer, there is no better way to get exposure and practice than Instagram. And if you want friends and family to read, tap into your pre-made network of friends on Facebook. All blogging platforms allow you to link the posts with a little button on the right or left side (or found on the ""Settings"" page), which means the site will automatically post things to social media for you every time you post a blog post. Social media is your friend, and it is the best way to get your work out there., Offer to write content for them and link back to your own site. If your content is interesting enough, then you will build a fan base naturally. You might also get travel tips from others that have been there, and get ideas for new posts or topics to tackle. The best way to learn to write is to read, so pick up a few of your favorite travel blogs and start reading.


A lot of great travel writing these days takes place in papers and magazines, like The New York Times Travel Sections, Sunset Magazine, Outdoor Magazine, and National Geographic. Go online and look up if they have covered your location for ideas on where to go and what to see."

Clear your existing cache.,
Test your browser.",How to Block a Website on Mac1," Power up your computer and wait for it to be completely operation-ready. This might take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Keep in mind that in order to block websites on your Mac you need to change the computer's hosts file. A hosts file is a computer file that maps the websites you visit and that allows your computer to be identified through various electronic communication methods, such as the Internet. What you're trying to do is, in essence, telling the hosts file to redirect a specific web address so that it no longer reaches your screen. Keep in mind that this method is a bit technical.


Go to the Main Applications folder.
Click Utilities.
Select the program Terminal from the list.

You can also look for the terminal by accessing spotlight and running a search through it.

;
, Things can go wrong when you least expect it so making a copy is always a good idea. To make a copy, follow these steps:


Type the following on the terminal line: ""sudo nano /etc/hosts"".
Hit enter on the terminal command line. This allows you to open up your hosts file in a nano box.
Input your admin password when prompted.

It might seem as if the letters and symbols you're typing aren't being recorded because the cursor won't move. But they are, in fact, being registered properly.



, Now that the hosts file is open, several text lines used for mapping purposes will appear.


Enter ""127.0.0.1"" below the last text line.
Press the space bar.
Enter the specific IP address of the website you would like to block. For example, ""127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com"".

, Many more web addresses can be blocked in this exact fashion. Just remember: avoid using ""http"" and begin directly with ""www"".

, Once you are finished adding web addresses to be blocked, follow the following steps to finish the process.


Press and hold the control key and press ""O"" to save the file.
Press and hold the control key and press ""X"" to exit the host file.

, Your cache is where your computer saves recent information so that it can readily access it at a later date. You might never become aware of your cache as it operates in the background and is hence not visible to you. So to put the changes you made into action, you need to flush your cache to get rid of its past saved history.


Type ""sudo dscacheutil -flushcache"".

, And Ta-da! It's now time to test your results. Simply open Safari and enter a website you wanted blocked. The screen should come back as blank, or with an error message.

Begin blocking websites.",How to Block a Website on Mac2," Your router is the device needed to connect your computer(s) to the internet. Within a home, it's usually called a Wifi-router which means that it allows your computer to be wireless, and hence more portable and accessible. Though different routers might require different addresses in order to be opened, most routers can be accessed with the same address. As with the previous method, this is also a bit technical.


Enter 192.168.1.1 into your browser. If this address doesn't work for your router, try two of the following ones: 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.2.1.

If you need more help figuring out your router, check out one or both of these sites: www.routerpasswords.com and www.cirt.net.


Once prompted, enter your username and password.

, It might be named security panel or it might be something different. Either way, navigate to the tab that displays blocking controls. They can normally be reached under ""Content Filtering"" or ""Access Restrictions"".

Go to Parental Control.
Click on the lock symbol on the bottom left side. Enter your administrator password.
Click on the guest account on the left side bar.

Please be aware that you will not have the option of setting up blocking controls for the administrator (likely yourself). The administrator's account will therefore not appear on the left side.



, Once you are in Parental Controls, you will notice a few option tabs at the top of your window: Apps, Web, People, Time Limits, and Other.


Click on the Web option. You will note three other options: Allow unrestricted access to websites, Try to limit access to adult websites automatically, and Allow access to these websites only. The last option has a Customize button below it. This is the option with the widest blocking range, and likely best suited for this task.
Click the Customize button. A new window will appear divided into two sections: Always allow these websites, and Never allow these websites.
Go to Never allow these websites and click on the + button on the bottom left side. Now, simply type in the website(s) you wish to block. Example: www.facebook.com.

You could also choose Allow access to only these websites. It might it a bit too restrictive, but this way, you'll block anything that isn't specifically approved by you.

Check the box on the last screen of the installation to update virus definitions immediately.

, You should do this whether you think you need to or not. You might be surprised at what you find!


Malwarebytes will ask if you would like to update definitions every time you initiate a scan. Since new malware is released every day, you should always make sure the definitions are up to date before scanning.
Only a quick scan will be necessary in most cases. The quick scan takes about five to ten minutes, and targets only the directories in which malware programs are most likely to take root.
If the quick scan turns up a lot of results, you might want to follow it with a full system scan. This can take hours depending on the size of your hard drive.
It is best to exit your browser and not use your computer for anything else while a scan is in progress.

Understand Ante-Post Betting.",How to Bet on the Cheltenham Festival Ladies Day Online," The Cheltenham Festival – also called the National Hunting Meet – has been held for more than a century and a half. Among sports fans in the UK and Ireland, it is considered one of the most important sporting events of the year, on par with the British Grand Prix or Wimbledon. The current four-day format at Cheltenham has been in effect since 2005; in 2013, there were 27 races including one major race on each day. In 2014, the Champion Hurdle (on the first day, also known as Champion Day), The Queen Mother Champion Chase (on Wednesday, March 12, also known as Ladies Day), The World Hurdle (on March 13, known as St Patrick's Thursday), and the Cheltenham Gold Cup (held on the final day of the festival: Gold Cup Friday). All the races are held in the afternoon, and betting over the course of the festival is expected to generate hundreds of millions of pounds, both at the racecourse and online. Punters who cannot attend the festivities can still have a front-row seat, as many Web sites, including William Hill, offer live streaming of the races.;
, For the past eight years, the second day of the Cheltenham Festival is Ladies Day, and it is THE day to see and be seen. The racing centrepiece of Ladies Day is the Queen Mother Champion Chase, named for the Queen Mother on her 80th birthday. While the afternoon is dedicated to the horse races (seven in all), the morning is all about fashion, style, and glamour. The royal family tends to make an appearance on Ladies Day, turning it into a front-page news item and not just an event relegated to the sports pages. Female attendees come dressed to the nines in order to compete for one of the Fashion Awards: Best Dressed, Best Hat, and Best Accessories. Prizes for the winners include gift vouchers for clothing, all-expenses-paid holiday breaks, and bottles of Champagne.

, On Ladies Day, there is always an impressive line-up of horse races. Last year, the schedule was almost the same as it will be for 2014 Ladies Day:


Neptune Investment Hurdle
RSA Chase
Queen Mother Champion Chase
Coral Cup
Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle
Glenfarclas Cross Country Handicap Chase
Weatherbys Champion Bumper.

, Although past winners of specific races are often heavily favoured to repeat their achievements, factors such as recent racing history and the health of the horse can affect the ante post odds. Keeping track of pre-Cheltenham races, i.e., keeping your finger on the pulse of the horse racing world in the months and weeks ahead of the festival, can make you a smarter and more savvy bettor.The opening race on Ladies Day 2014, the Neptune Investment Novices Hurdle and, historically, this race has been won by a favourite (as opposed to a horse with long odds). However, a look at recent results will show that Captain Cutter won the important Challow Novices Hurdle at the end of December, which could mean that he’s a threat although Faugheen is the 2014 ante post favourite.The RSA Chase is always an interesting competition. Although Lord Windermere won the race last year, Carlingford Lough, with a victory at the Topaz Novice Chase on Christmas, is looking promising for 2014. Ballycasey and Smad Place may have better odds, but that important first-place finish is something to keep in mind when wagering. The Queen Mother Champion Chase – the Ladies Day feature race – was won in 2013 by the great Sprinter Sacre who, therefore, is a strong favourite to win again. But this is a good example of where paying attention to news and tips is important: Sprinter Sacre’s health is somewhat dubious (he’s had heart issues, it seems) and so other horses are being looked at as serious contenders, such as Sire De Grugy and Captain Conan to win in 2014.

, Those who attend the races can check out the horses when they are displayed in the parade ring; however it is just as easy to assess a horse's chances and research his history when betting online. Top horse-race betting sites, of which there are many, use experienced experts who share extensive information and tips. At the best and most comprehensive sites, the odds are listed for every horse and every race, while news items about favourites and past winners are available at the click of a mouse. Betting online is convenient and quick; it is the method of choice for the vast majority of the world's horseracing fanatics.

, Online betting sites offer odds long before the opening day of the festival. William Hill, the venerable bookmaker with an excellent reputation on land and now online, for example, is a reliable site on which to place bets. They have special radio broadcasts to hear live updates, the latest news, recent trends, expert commentaries, and relevant interviews. The site is also a great source of helpful pointers and useful tips to enhance the betting experience. During the races, they broadcast the races live, streamed from Cheltenham Racecourse to your computer, tablet or smartphone, so you can follow the action in real time no matter where you happen to be.

, Although the Cheltenham Festival attracts more than 200,000 ticket-holders, most of the betting will be through online bookmakers. In addition, much of the gambling takes place before post time. Pre-race betting – commonly called ante-post betting – is available in the weeks prior to the start of the festival, up to shortly before the start of the actual races. Ante-post odds are offered for every horse running in every race, and they change according to numerous factors. Through the many Internet sports betting venues, you'll find that's it's easy to bet on the Cheltenham races. The only things you'll be missing out on are those hats.

, Before you can start filming a review of your own, think about what you want to review. It can be any book, movie or TV show you know of.

, Sometimes footage is used in reviews as it helps tell what it is, so getting footage from the movie, game or show you're reviewing will help with the review.

, Most Internet reviewers tend to do their reviews straight from their own rooms, now this is entirely optional, and you can do it outside as well if you like, but it's all about location.

Select ""Settings"" and then click the ""Privacy"" tab on the left.
Find the ""Do you want other search engines to link to your timeline?"" option. Click ""Edit"" and then uncheck the box.

, Chances are that if you have a Gmail or YouTube account, you have a Google+ profile as well. Google+ profiles will appear towards the top of Google search results.


Log into your Google+ profile at plus.google.com.
Click the ""Home"" menu in the upper-left corner and select ""Settings"".
Uncheck the ""Help others discover my profile in search results"" box in the ""Profile"" section. This will stop search engines from crawling your page. It may take several days for this change to take effect.

, If you use Twitter, you can set your tweets to private. This will prevent others from reading your tweets unless they are authorized by you. This will make it much harder to gain new followers.


Log into your Twitter account and click your profile icon.
Select ""Settings"" and then click the ""Security and privacy"" tab on the left.
Check the ""Protect my Tweets"" box in the ""Privacy"" section. You'll still need to remove your old tweets if you don't want them appearing.

, There's a good chance that the people you care about on your social networks know who you are, so changing your name will help hide your profiles from search engines. Change your name to a nickname that your friends and family will recognize you as, but others won't search for.


Facebook - You can change your name from the ""General"" section of the Settings menu. Click ""Edit"" next to your name. You can only change your name every 60 days.
Google+ - Open your Google+ profile page and click your name. Enter in your new name. This will change your name for all Google products connected with that profile, such as Gmail and YouTube.
Twitter - Log into Twitter and open your profile. Click the ""Edit profile"" button and then change the name underneath your picture.

, You'll be able to attack your problem much easier if you know where to focus your efforts. Perform web searches on your name using a variety of different search engines. Add modifiers like your location to help narrow down the results. Note the top results for each one.


Using multiple search engines will help you find everything that's out there, as different engines crawl the web in different ways.
Remember, it's not the search engine that is causing your name to appear, it is content on the web.

, Many websites will have contact information in the ""Contact"" section, or in the footer of the page. Use this contact information to send a request to the site owner to remove the content with your information.


You can use WHOIS, a domain registry database, to attempt to find contact information if none is listed. If the domain was privately registered, your request will be sent to a proxy company, and may or may not be forwarded to the actual owner.

, If something attached to your name is posted on a domain you can't control - for example, a blog post on someone else's blog - a polite, concise email can go a long way. Simply ask them nicely to remove your name from their site. Keep in mind that they are under no obligation to do as you ask; this is why politeness is absolutely crucial to getting them to fulfill your request.


You may have heard that it is illegal to publish information about someone that is defamatory or slanderous. In truth, determining whether content is defamatory or slanderous is an extremely nuanced legal matter; additionally, there is a loophole regarding slanderous content online in which website owners are not responsible for user-submitted content For you, this means that again, they are not under any legal obligation to remove said content. Depending on the website, though, sending a polite email request just might get the job done.

, If the site owner cooperates and removes the content, it may still appear in Google's search results. While this will eventually go away, you can speed up the removal process by filing to have that URL removed from the search results. Fill out the form here to have the URL processed for removal.

, There are a variety of online directories that may have information about you, including your name, phone number, and address. You'll need to send information removal requests to each of these directory sites. Some of the most popular directory sites include Intelius and Spokeo.You can use services such as Abine's DeleteMe to automatically contact all of these directory sites with removal requests. This will cost you money, but can be much more time-effective if you want to be thorough.

, You can use the WHOIS search to find the host of the website. The host has the power to remove pages, especially if they violate the host's terms and policies. Chances are that most hosts don't allow slanderous or defamatory content, and you can use this to remove your information. Contact the host when the site owner isn't responding or is refusing to remove content.

, Send a polite but strong message to the host's contact address. If you can, describe the specific policies that the content you want removed is violating. If the host is trustworthy and your claim is legitimate, this will usually be enough to cause action.

, If someone is illegally posting your copyrighted content, you can submit a DCMA takedown request to the host. While this won't work for your name or information, since that isn't copyrightable, it can be effective at keeping your work from being spread illegally. Some hosting companies have contact links dedicated to copyright violations, while others will need to have messages sent to the standard contact addresses.


See How to Write a DMCA Take Down Request for detailed instructions on how to word and send the request.

, If the site owner and the host are refusing the remove your content, you may have to resort to legal measures. This will be most effective if either the site owner or the hosting company are in the same country as you.


Remember, this method will only be useful if the content that is posted is actually illegal (slanderous, defamatory, copyright). It is not illegal for someone to just post your name on a website.

, This is the cheapest option, and is often good enough to scare the recipient into taking down the content. You only need a few hours of the lawyer's time to perform this, so it shouldn't cost too much. Send the notice to both the site owner and the hosting company.

, This is the most expensive solution, and should only be attempted if you are absolutely sure the content is illegal. You'll have to pay legal fees, unless you are able to win your case and have the site owner or host pay them. Consult with a lawyer to determine if this is the correct course of action for you. You'll have a very hard time even getting a court date if the host is from a different country.


See How to Get a Court Order for more information on filing a court order.

, If you just can't get someone to take down negative information about you, the best course of action is to try to bury it in good content. This means you may be actively taking the opposite approach of removing your name, since you'll want lots of results for your name that are positive.

, Since the goal of this is to bury a negative piece of content, you'll want to create as much neutral and positive content as possible. This includes social networks, as these are often ranked highly in search results. Sign up for every major social network and make sure your accounts are set to be publicly-viewable.


Sign up for Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, Vine, Pinterest, Instagram, and any other popular networks.

, Create accounts on sites like Quora, GitHub, Stack Exchange, and other public sites (even wikiHow). All of these will contribute to your search results. Once you've created a profile, make some helpful posts on popular threads to increase the chance that your name will be linked to it in a search result.

, This URL will shoot to the top of any search for your name because it is an exact match.


It also helps to include a link to this domain on your public social media profiles. The more a URL is linked to from an outside source, the higher up it will appear in search results.Use this opportunity to market yourself or your business. Include some positive information, especially if you are trying to bury content that doesn't put you in a very good light.

, If you really want to make a dent on your search result, a popular blog will go a long way. This will take a lot of time, but is probably the most effective way to bury a bad article or page. You can start a blog for free using Blogger, WordPress, or a variety of other services. Try to post at least once a week to start building up content.


See How to Start a Blog for some tips on getting your blog started.

, If you run a business and are trying to bury a bad review, ask your satisfied customers to consider leaving a review on Yelp or Google+. Enough good reviews could quickly drown out a negative one.

, It may take weeks or months for your content to overtake the negative piece, especially if it is popular. Even if you go with a paid service, it will likely take a significant amount of time for the search result rankings to change.

, If you reside in the European Union, you may have Google review your data and decide if it is eligible to be removed from the search results. To do this, you'll need to fill out a form indicating what results you want removed. Not all requests will be granted, and public information such as criminal convictions, malpractice, and financial scams will likely not be removed.


Go to the form page to begin submitting the request.

, You'll need to include your name as well as the name that retrieves the results you want to remove. You'll also need to include specific URLs for search results that you want to get rid of. Each URL you add will need an explanation as to why you think it should be removed (outdated, irrelevant, objectionable, etc.).

, This doesn't have to be a scan of your passport or ID, but it should have enough information to verify that you are the person making the request.

, If the information is deemed not of public interest, then the results will be removed from Google search results. It may take a while for your request to be reviewed, and even longer for it to be processed.

, Google doesn't remove much from their search results, but you can file for removing special case information. This includes social security numbers, bank account or credit card numbers, an image of your signature, personal pictures uploaded without your consent, or the name of your business if it was associated with adult spam.


Remember, this will not remove the content from the web, and it can still be easily accessed by visiting the site. If you want this content removed, you'll need to contact the site owners.

, If you feel that you fall into one of the above categories, you can fill out a form to request that the offending URL be removed from Google's search results. Go to this Google support page to get started.

, You'll be prompted to select whether the page containing the content is still online or not.

, You'll be shown a list of all of the types of content that Google will remove from the search results. Once you select the type of information, a detailed form will appear.

, You'll be asked to provide the site URL, as well as your contact information. You'll also need the URL of the search results page that it appears on. Once you have filled out the form, it will be submitted for review.

, If Google verifies that the site is displaying your personal information without your consent, it will remove that URL from its search results. Note that this will not remove the content from the internet, and it can be easily linked and shared through social networks. If you want the content off the internet, you'll need to go through the site owner, the host, or the legal system.

Consider using parental control software.",How to Disable Internet Access2," Click the ""Windows"" key or the ""Start"" icon, then click on ""Control Panel"".


If you are using Windows 8, you can move the mouse up to the top right-hand corner of your screen to show the ""charm bar,"" then click on ""Control Panel"". Alternately, hold down the Windows key while pressing C and click on ""Settings"".

, Under Network and Internet—if you are viewing by category—click on ""Network settings, network adapters"", then click on ""View network status and tasks"". If you are viewing by icons instead of by category, click on ""Network and Sharing Center"".

, Now, right-click on the highlighted WiFi connection and click ""Disable"". This should block the computer from accessing this particular WiFi network, but it will not block any others unless you disable them as well. This setting should not stop any other computers from logging onto the WiFi network.


This process is reversible. If you want to enable the network connection later, you can do so by right-clicking on the WiFi connection and clicking ""Enable"".
You must be logged on as an administrator or a member of the Administrators group in order to complete this process. If your computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may also prevent you from disabling the connection.

, For a more advanced disable on Windows, go to Start>All Programs>Accessories, right-click Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator, grant the prompt if necessary, and type ""mmc compmgmt.msc"" (without quotes) and press enter. Wait for it to load, then click Device Manager in the left-hand frame. Open the Network Adapters subtree, right-click all devices listed there, and select Disable. Now restart for good measure (this is optional).


To undo this, simply repeat the process but instead of selecting Disable, select Enable.

, You can also disable access to the Internet using third-party parental control software. These programs allow you to limit the sites that a computer can access, and they also allow you to completely block a computer from using the Internet. You need to install the software directly to the computer in question. You may need to pay a small user fee, depending on the program, but you will be able to rest assured that your child is not using the Internet in a way that you haven't approved.


On Apple OS X, you can configure the built-in parental controls to disable access to the internet for certain accounts.

Consider using an internet-toggling app.,
Try using the Toggle Internet script.,
Toggle your Internet.,
Try using Let Me Work.",How to Disable Internet Access4," These programs may come in handy if you want to temporarily disable your Internet access for an entire computer, but you don't want to navigate the firewall settings each time you do so. Perhaps you want to get some work done offline, but you don't want to completely isolate yourself from the possibility of using the Internet. You can usually choose to disable all sites or just certain sites.

, This app will help you “forcefully” step away from the Internet by temporarily disabling all Internet access from your computer. This little script will allow you to completely disable the Internet on your Windows computer with a click. You can restore the Internet connection anytime later with another click. To get started, download Toggle-Internet.bat to your desktop.

, Right click on the Toggle desktop icon. Choose “Run as Administrator,” and you’ll be instantly disconnected from the Internet. Later, when you need to reconnect, just right-click the same file and run as an administrator as before.


Internally, the script merely toggles the status of your Network Adapter (also known as the LAN adapter or Ethernet card) thus shutting down the Internet for you. If you were to disable or enable the Network Adapter manually, the steps would be Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> View Network Status -> Change Adapter Settings.

, Toggle Internet will temporarily block all sites, but you may wish to disable access to just a select groups of distracting websites while staying connected to Google Docs or your email. Download the Let Me Work script. You can specify the list of sites that should be blocked and this script will modify the Windows HOSTS file to shut them off, temporarily."

Search the site for the ""homebrew browser"" to access the most up-to-date link., Click the link to download the files onto your computer. The download will come as a “.zip” file and will need to be “unzipped” in order to access and install.

, Depending on your operating system and specific settings, your computer may automatically unzip upon download. If so the .zip file will be expanded into a series of folders containing the browser files. If not, you’ll need to unzip using a separate application.


On a Mac, Unarchiver is a free, well-reviewed option for unzipping.On a PC, choose from free software options like 7-zip or IZArc., The Wii has slots for either a USB device or an SD card - you will need one or the other for this installation. The storage device will also be used to store your soon-to-be-downloaded Homebrew applications and utilities, so consider buying or designating a specific storage device for this purpose.

, Ensure first that there is space available to write on the device and that it is formatted correctly to receive new files. To learn more about formatting your storage device go to Format an SD Card or to Format a Flash Drive. This storage device will be used to store all your Homebrew related files - that includes the browser files themselves and any future downloads you access via the Homebrew browser.


For SD cards, ensure that the write-lock switch is off.

, This folder must be created in the root directory of your storage device and have this exact name. Naming it like this allows the Homebrew channel on your Wii to know exactly where to look for the Homebrew browser (as well as other) files.


The “apps” folder must named in all lowercase characters.

, The browser files that you’ve downloaded and unzipped will be in at least 2 separate subfolders. One folder will be the browser files (“homebrew_browser”) and the other will be Help materials. Drag the “homebrew_browser” folder into your storage device’s “apps” folder.The other files from the Homebrew browser download do not need to be moved to your storage device in order for the browser to work.
It may be worth reading through the Help materials in the Homebrew browser download at your convenience, to gain a more thorough understanding of the software you will be using but it is not required.

, Once the browser files are on the storage device, it’s time to eject it from your computer and insert it into your Wii.

, Your Wii must be connected to the internet in order to properly install the browser. Run a connectivity test before proceeding if you are unsure.

Get to your favorite social media sites by typing in the exact address into your browser.,
When visiting a site, and logging in, look for the padlock icon.,
Take time to learn how cyber criminals work.The most common methods are through email (phishing and spam), malware, adware, and spyware.,
Remember these main things if you remember nothing else:


Pick a good, strong password, always.,
Don't mistake the user-friendliness of social networking sites for safety.,
Know how your chosen social media sites protect your privacy.,
Don't accept just anyone as part of your friend's list.",How to Defend Against Cybercrime on Social Networks1," Never go in through an email link or via another website to reach it because it could be a trap to get your account name and password.

, This is an indication that the site is authenticated and encrypted, protected by means of Transport Layer Security (TLS)., Less than benign uses are being made of software all the time:


Consider whether any software you're downloading that can access your social media profile is legit. Many people use programs which will ""add friends"" for you, or update your status automatically in some way. If the software isn't benign, these can bog down your computer speed and at worst, can share all of your private information back to the originators of the software.
Scare ware - programs that say they are checking your computer for viruses but actually return a false infected return, leading to the victim being persuaded to hand over credit card information to have the computer ""cleaned"".While you won't usually find such ""Warnings!"" on social media sites themselves, you may if you click on a bad link (such as if your friend's account got hijacked by a virus or spammer, and is putting out updates with suspicious links).

, Don't base passwords on personal information that can be easily accessed or guessed, don't use words that can be found in any dictionary of any language, develop a mnemonic for remembering complex passwords, use both lowercase and capital letters, use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, use pass phrases when you can, and use different passwords on different systems.Don't confuse being well-known online with being protected. If anything, the more you're known, the more you're exposed.

, This user-friendliness increases the ways that people can find out more about you and that is not always a good thing. Think before:


Posting photos that identify you, your family members and where you live.
Posting photos of the state of your desk. It could be that the bank account number you just keyed in is still obviously scrawled on a note pad square in the middle of the photo!
Telling people what you're about to do if it involves leaving the house.
Adding your child's name to any pictures.

, Don't just assume that they will do it, but know that they will and how it is done. This means reading their terms and conditions and the ""frequently asked questions"". If you still don't know, send their help team a question, or leave your questions on the forums or other communication channels for general answers.


Hide your personal information from others. Did you know that the things social networking sites ask for (age, date of birth, email address, phone number, mother's maiden name), are all that a hacker needs to impersonate you or to impersonate being someone that you know to get information from you?Don't ever give personal information to someone you've just met online. They could be up to no good and you have no way of knowing.

, To do so opens you up to the possibility of an identity thief getting as much information about you as possible. Be discerning and do some background research first. If you do want to have a lot of friends (such as is commonplace on sites like Twitter and Facebook), be very careful if any of the ones who are not well known to you start asking lots of personal questions or even want to ""meet you"" for real. Trust your instincts.

Stay aware.,
Be careful about opening attachments.,
Use a trustworthy and reputable email system or site.",How to Defend Against Cybercrime on Social Networks2," It is good practice to be take care when using email information and links. Don't just follow any link sent to you by email, think first:


Don't go to a site through your email–ever. Not even if it was solicited first. Just type the name of the site into your browser and open it that way.
Avoid answering emails even in jest. While you may feel the temptation to respond with a funny reply, this can actually be harmful if it confirms your existence. At best, it will lead to more spam, at worst, it can lead to the cyber criminal learning more about you than they would had you not replied.;
, The basic rule should be that you only open them if you have received them from people you really trust. Given the ease with which a cyber criminal can work out identities, it could be someone posing as a friend sending you information that contains malware:


Consider the usual behavior of the sender. Do you know this person? Do you trust their own ability to judge whether or not information is trustworthy? Is it within character for this person to send you such a link, or is this out of the norm? Maybe they have gotten a virus through their messaging software and it's their computer sending it, not an actual person.
Look for things that don't appear right. If you receive an invitation to visit a site, or to give information out from someone you know, consider whether or not this is an interest they'd really have. For example, if they ask you to visit a music site, ask yourself first if the sender is an actual fan of the musician whose site you've just been sent? If it rings false, proceed with great caution, and preferably contact the sender first.

, If you're using free email programs, check their privacy policy, their provision of SSL security (find out whether this is available by looking for a ""secure mode"" or by replacing the ""http:"" in the URL with ""https:""), and be satisfied that it is a reliable service with very little, or no, downtime. If none of these indicators are there, avoid using the service.

Protect yourself.,
Take the most care when using public computers.,
Report cyber crime and IP fraud.",How to Defend Against Cybercrime on Social Networks3," This includes using anti-virus, anti-spyware programs, and a firewall.

, Take care that people can't see what you're surfing and if at all possible, avoid using passwords, especially ones that link to bank accounts and other important sites.

, It is only by being vigilant that we can stay one step ahead of cyber criminals, and reporting their activities helps to form a bigger picture of what is happening, as well as potentially helping you.

"
"
Watch the news.,
Subscribe to tech blogs that keep you updated on new security issues.",How to Defend Against Cybercrime on Social Networks4," Keep up to date with the news about online security happenings. Breaking news will appear on Twitter and Facebook within a short space of time, and anything like viruses going around will be mentioned on them, as well as in the news.

Teach children to beware of online dangers.,

Keep computers where you can see them when kids are using them.",How to Defend Against Cybercrime on Social Networks5," Find sites that will help you as a parent or guardian explain the issues concerning safety online. You don't need to figure out how to do this all alone - there are reputable, quality, independent sites that are assessing and monitoring online media challenges for children. Find such sites and look for materials and games for kids that can help kids to to learn about the issues with your help., Take the time to explain:


Cyber crime in simple words
Ways to be responsible online
The importance of privacy settings and how to use them
Which age-appropriate sites you're happy for them to use - focus on what they can do, rather than what they can't

, And let children know that you're always available to help them if they feel worried or bothered by anything online - the most important lesson is the one about your own accessibility and willingness to step in and fix online problems with them. Be consistent - children respect the boundaries you set far better when you are consistent and when you practice what you preach.

Check the number of rails.,
Get a modular PSU.,
Compare the amperage of each voltage.",How to Buy a Power Supply," Use a PSU calculator web page or software to help determine your requirements.

Typically, most Pentium 4 and Athlon 64 CPU-based motherboards (and earlier) will require a 20-pin ATX connector, while newer motherboards require a 24-pin ATX connector. Also, most PSUs will have both a 4-pin and 8-pin auxiliary 12V connector for motherboards, and only high-end PSUs will have one or more 6-pin PCI-E connectors for video cards.

, And, ones rated under load temperatures, not room temperatures. Anything 80% and above is good. At 83%, approximately 17% of the wattage is lost as heat. Therefore, a PSU that may be advertised as a 500W PSU, will actually be drawing almost 600W at the wall. Efficiency drops over time and during the life of the PSU. A year-old PSU is most likely not capable of producing the same amount of energy it once did when it was new.

, How well does the PSU handle changes in current? Although not a guarantee, there's a strong correlation between weight and quality: bigger components (ie, capacitors) equate to a more tolerant, reliable PSU. This is one downside to a 120mm fan: while it does provide quieter cooling, the components to be cooled must be more tightly packed. If you don't care about noise, an 80mm cooling fan in the traditional place on the rear of the PSU may offer better value.

, Just as your house's fuse box includes both a large main breaker and a smaller circuit breaker per circuit to ensure the smaller-branch circuit wires do not overheat, high-capacity PSUs divide their output into multiple ""rails,"" each with a smaller current limit. The relevant safety standard requires a 20A limit, which is quite generous, given that the wires are smaller than those used in your house to carry 15A. (But there's the advantage that the wires aren't hidden in walls, so they're cooled better, and you'll smell it if something starts burning.) This, however, makes connecting the PSU more complex; in addition to not overloading it overall, you have to avoid overloading each rail, or it will shut down. A good power supply will make that easy by providing rails totalling much more than the total PSU rating. A cheaper alternative is to provide just enough rails to total the overall capacity, which makes it difficult to use all of a power supply's capacity. (This may be a clue that the PSU is incapable of delivering its full-rated capacity.) An even cheaper alternative, which has become quite popular, is to eliminate all of the safety circuitry and produce a ""single-rail"" power supply that can deliver all of its output on any wire. This is technically in violation of the ATX-power-supply specification but has not proved to be a safety problem in practice, and is preferred by many people. A single-rail design isn't itself a sign of a low-quality PSU.

, It will help eliminate extra wires to get in the way of cooling. Ignore the claims by PC Power & Cooling that modular cables create more resistance due to corrosion of contacts. The additional resistance is negligible.

, A PSU's wattage rating isn't conducive to determining amperage at any specific voltage. All PSUs will have a sticker with their rated amperage at each voltage level. This information should be provided when purchasing a PSU from an online vendor and visible on the unit's retail box. As mentioned above, modern computers are 12V-heavy loads. A 500W PSU may sound adequate, but if its 12V amperage is in the low 20s or less (12V times 25A is 300W), it may not be able to power a modern computer.

The role of your computer will heavily dictate the components that you will need. Regardless of the final function of your computer, every computer needs the same basic components.


Keep your budget in mind, too. If your computer will be mostly for office work, internet surfing, or checking e-mails, you could probably get away with a budget of $400. If your computer will be a basic gaming build capable of playing most games with an acceptable framerate at decent settings and 720p-1080p then a budget of around $600-700, (or more depending on if you want a bit more extra power) should be fine. If you want a gaming build that can max out new triple-A titles then you should have a budget of $800 and above, and if you want to build a very-high-end 1080p/4K video-editing machine, you may have to spend more than $4,000. Remember to assign money in the budget for the OS, monitor, mouse, headphones, microphone, webcam, speakers, and any other needed peripherals if you do not have them.;
, This is the ""brain"" of your computer. Almost all processors are multi-core, meaning they are essentially multiple processors in one. Compare specs and find a processor that is up to date, not one that may sound right but could be an old model. They change, becoming out of date and unsupported by the manufacturers and software makers. Always try to get a processor from the current generation, as they typically are faster and more efficient than their previous generation counterpart. Choose one with the speed that you will need to run the programs you want. Also take into account power usage and the type of and ease of cooling. Inadequate cooling is a killer for the processor.


Intel has two types of CPUs: K and non-K. You need a K-type CPU if you are going to overclock your computer. Most AMD CPUs are already overclockable or easily unlockable so you can overclock them. Avoid the Intel Celeron and Pentium series as most of those CPUs are slow, but they have been improving with clock speeds over 3 GHz. If you are building a mid-end or higher level computer, use an Intel Core i3/i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen CPU with high core count. You can use a Pentium for maxing out Triple A titles when combined with a good graphics card, but you may be better off with a better CPU.

, If the processor is the brain, then the motherboard is the torso. The motherboard is what connects all of the internal components of your computer. The processor you purchase will determine the type of motherboard you will need. Different processors have different “socket” sizes, and only work with motherboards that support that socket. Your choice here will depend on what processor you have, how much memory you want, the size of your case, and how many drives you want to connect to it.


Motherboards come in many form factors, but the most common are ATX and Micro ATX. ATX is the standard full-size motherboard. If you are building a typical tower computer, look for ATX motherboards. µATX boards are smaller than the standard ATX board, and are better if you want a smaller case and have no need for more than four expansion slots.
Make sure that your motherboard supports all of the other components that you wish to install. If you are planning on installing a high-end graphics card, the motherboard will need to support the PCI Express interface. If you want to install lots of RAM, your motherboard will need to be able to hold at least 4 sticks.
Sometimes you can get the processor and the motherboard as a combo package, which could end up saving you a bit of money. Just make sure you're not settling for a model of processor or motherboard that you don't want just to save a few bucks.
Always do at least a little bit of research on the exact specs of your motherboard on the manufacturer's website. If you are unsure if your CPU and motherboard socket sizes match just check what socket the specs say, if your CPU and motherboard both say LGA 1150 then it will match. There are many different socket sizes that exist but in reality you won't need to worry since only a few of those are not outdated.

, RAM (Random Access Memory) is where programs store information that they are using. If you don’t have enough RAM, your programs will run much slower than they should. The RAM you can purchase is dictated by the motherboard that you choose. The speed of the RAM that you install must be supported by the motherboard.You can check the manufacturer's websites for both components to check.


RAM should always be installed in matching pairs of sticks (if you're buying more than one stick). All the RAM in the system should be the same speed, and preferably the same make and model. For example, if you want 8 GB of RAM, you can install two matching 4 GB sticks or four matching 2 GB sticks.
If you intend to use more than 4 GB of RAM, you will need to install a 64-bit operating system. 32-bit operating systems do not recognize more than 4 GB of RAM, even if more is installed. 2 matching sticks will offer the best performance due to a feature called ""Dual-Channel"".

, Your hard drive stores your operating system, installed programs, and all of your data. Make sure you choose a good manufacturer when choosing your hard drive because nothing is worse than a dead hard drive.


Hard drives come in many speeds, the most common being 5400, 7200, or 10000 RPM. The regular speed you should choose is 7200 RPM. There are also solid state drives, which don't have any moving parts, and allow for faster speeds. The cons are that they're quite expensive and have limited storage space compared to similarly-priced traditional drives. Solid state drives are best used for your operating system and essential programs. Put your games, music and movies on a separate HDD. That way you'll have a PC that can boot quickly, run quickly and have a lot of space. Solid state drives come in several different form factors, like the standard 2.5"" size, M.2, and as an add-in card that directly attaches to a PCI Express slot on your motherboard.

, A dedicated graphics card is essential for playing the latest games, but not a major issue for a computer for daily tasks. Nearly all Intel CPUs have integrated graphics, so you don’t need a dedicated card if you’re planning to use the computer for office work, web browsing email, and a little bit of online gaming. If you watch or edit a lot of HD video or play a lot of games, you'll want a dedicated video card. If you are building a PC for gaming or workstation purposes, then a graphic processor unit card (GPU), or an external graphic card (meaning one not built into the motherboard) is extremely important and its selection depends on your budget and your requirements. The GPU with more CUDA parallel computing cores are at higher costs.


Make sure you choose a GPU from an up-to-date line, so that you can play games at full speed. GPUs are important, because it connects to your monitor. AMD has a Radeon line, which range from budget to midrange GPUs that can run things fast enough (but not the best). If you want to choose an AMD Radeon graphics card, choose a Radeon RX 400 or 500 Series. Nvidia has a GeForce GTX line, with cards like the GTX 1080 Ti and Titan Xp that are currently the fastest consumer-grade graphics cards in the world with high-end features like GDDR5X VRAM and more than 3,000 parallel computing cores, but they're very expensive, costing $500-$1,500. Nvidia also has a Quadro line for workstation, 4K movie editing, gas and mining exploration, bitcoin mining, and space exploration. Quadros usually cost more than $1,000 and are not recommended for gaming.
You can use 2 graphics cards at a time, provided that they have the same GPU and amount of VRAM. For Nvidia graphics cards, you will need to use a special connector called an ""SLI bridge"" to connect the cards together.

, The case is what holds your computer components. A few cases come with a power supply included, but if you are making a gaming build then getting a separate power supply is recommended, as the power supplies that come with cases are often not very high quality. The size of the case will be based on how many drives bays and card slots it has, as well as the size/type of your motherboard which also can support more or fewer drives and cards. Cases range from cheap and functional to flashy, bought for their appearance and expensive. Select one that allows for optimal airflow, and install extra fans if necessary. If you intend to run a lot of high-end components, you will be dealing with a lot more heat output than slower components.

, The power supply powers all of your components in your computer. Some cases come with a power supply already installed, but others require you to provide your own. The power supply should be powerful enough to charge all of your components; don't worry about it being so powerful that you waste electricity by powering more than you need, as it will only output as much watts as you use and the number on its wattage is only its max capacity. Don't skimp on this part, as picking a faulty power supply can damage all of your parts.


Choose a power supply from a reputable manufacturer like EVGA.
If your build will be for gaming you will need a power supply with 500W or more power depending on your hardware. Most power supplies usually supply 400W or more power. If your graphics card has 1 or more power sockets, you should make sure that your power supply has the same amount of power connectors for it. They are usually 6-pin or 8-pin.

, Read magazines and online consumer review sites for more information. Online forums like AnandTech are also very helpful when specific information is needed. Remember, this is one of the most important steps, because everything will depend on your hardware. There are many guides and reviews available from online magazines and consumer review websites.


Don't pick solely based on reviews but good reviews usually mean that there is nothing wrong with the part.
Remember, this is one of the most important steps, because everything will depend on your hardware so do not rush this part as it is not only important but also very fun. Also never be afraid to change things in your parts list, it is an important part of making a good parts list that will work for you.

, Once you know what to buy, you need to decide where to buy it from. Here's what to consider:


Knowing the credibility of a retailer. Choose a trusted and popular retailer so you don't get scammed.
Knowing where they ship to. Make sure your selected retailer ships to your country.
Knowing the price of the component and shipping fees. Make sure you choose the retailer (who is credible) with the best prices on your components. Remember that international and national shipping rates are often very different in pricing and also vary from each retailer to the next.
Buying from more than one retailer. You can buy from multiple retailers to get the best prices for each components but keep in mind you may end up paying more in shipping if some of your components are shipped separately from the rest.

, You might want to wear anti-static gloves or some sort of hand protection, as the inside of the case does not have ground down metal and could be very sharp in some cases.

, Some cases come with the power supply already installed, while others will require you to purchase the power supply separately and install it yourself. Make sure that the power supply is installed in the correct orientation, and that nothing is blocking the power supply's fan.


Make sure that your power supply is powerful enough to handle all of your components. This is especially important in high-end gaming computers, as dedicated graphics cards can draw a significant amount of power.

, Use an antistatic wrist-strap cable to prevent Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) which can be deadly to computer electronics. If you can't get an antistatic wrist-strap cable, plug your grounded power supply unit to an outlet (but don't turn it on), and keep your hand on the grounded unit whenever you touch any ESD-sensitive items.

, Place it on top of its box. DO NOT place it on top of the anti-static bag as the outside is conductive. You will be adding components to the motherboard before installing it in the case, as it is easier to access the motherboard before installing it.

, Observe the missing pins in the processor and match these with the socket on the motherboard. On many processors there will be a little gold arrow in the corner that you can use to orient the processor properly.

, Open the CPU socket and carefully insert the processor (no force needed). If it doesn't slip right in, or it feels like you have to push, it is probably misaligned. Close the socket and ensure the CPU is secure. Some sockets have small arms while others have complex assemblies to open and close the socket., Put only a dot (size of a grain of rice) of thermal paste on the CPU. Adding too much thermal paste will create a mess, such as getting paste into the motherboard socket, which may short circuit components, and decrease the motherboard's value if you plan to sell it later.


Some processors that come with heatsinks do not need thermal paste because the heatsink already has thermal paste applied by the factory. Check the bottom of the heatsink unit before applying paste to the processor., This varies from heat sink to heat sink, so read the instructions. Most stock coolers attach directly over the processor and clip into the motherboard. Aftermarket heatsinks may have brackets that need to be attached underneath the motherboard. Refer to your heat sink’s documentation for exact instructions.

, Place the RAM in the proper slots by opening the latches and pushing the RAM in until the little handles can lock it into position. Note how the RAM and slots are keyed--line them up so they will fit in properly. When pushing, press both sides of the RAM module with equal force. If RAM sockets have two colors, this may indicate the priority slots in case if you are not using all available slots.


Make sure that you install the RAM in the appropriate matching slots. Check your motherboard’s documentation to ensure that you are installing the RAM in the correct location.

, Many modern cases do not have a preinstalled backplate, but your motherboard should come with its own backplate. Some older cases have pre-installed I/O back plates, but it is unlikely that the case will have an appropriate backplate for your motherboard.


Removing the existing backplate may take a bit of force. Sometimes they have screws to hold them in place, but most are held in only by friction. Pop it out by pressing on the bracket from the rear side of the case.

, Push the new backplate into place in the back of the case. Make sure to install it the correct direction., Almost all cases come with a little baggie that has standoffs in it if not some come pre-installed with ATX (Or smaller if your case doesn't support ATX"" standoffs. Standoffs raise the motherboard off of the case, and allow screws to be inserted into them.


Your case most likely has more holes available than your motherboard supports. The number of spacers required will be determined by the number of shielded holes in the motherboard. Position the motherboard to discover where to screw in the standoffs.

, Once the standoffs are installed, place the motherboard in the case and push it up against the I/O backplate. All of the back ports should fit into the holes in the I/O backplate. Use the screws provided to secure the motherboard to the standoffs through the shielded screw holes on the motherboard.

, These tend to be located together on the motherboard near the front of the case. The order in which these are connected will depend on which is easiest. Make sure that you connect the USB ports, the Power and Reset switches, the LED power and hard drive lights, and the audio cable (HDAudio or AC97). Your motherboard’s documentation will show you where on your motherboard these connectors attach.


There is typically only one way that these connectors can attach to the motherboard. Don’t try to force anything to fit.

, Almost all modern graphics cards use PCI-E. Some will require you to remove two of the protective plates as opposed to just one. You may have to punch the plates out of the case.

, You may have to bend a tab on the slot to allow the graphics card to be inserted. The tab will help lock the graphics card in place (this is more important for bulkier, high-end cards). Apply light, even force until the card is seated uniformly, and the back panel lines up.

, Once you have inserted the card, use a screw to secure it to the back panel of the case. If you don’t secure your card, you could end up damaging it in the long run.

, If you have any other PCI cards that you are going to add, such as a dedicated sound card, the installation process is the same as the video card process.

, Most cases have panels in the front that protect the drive bays. Remove the panels for the locations that you want to install you optical drives. You do not need to remove any panels for hard drives.

, Almost all cases have cages built in that allow the drive to rest and fit snugly. Once the drive is lined up with the front panel of the computer, secure it with screws on each side of the drive.

, Slide the hard drive into the appropriate 3.5” bay in the inside of the case. Some cases have removable brackets that you can install on the hard drive first before sliding it in. Once the drive has been inserted into the cage, secure it on both sides with screws.

, All modern drives use SATA cables to connect the drive to the motherboard. Connect the cable to the SATA port on the drive, and then connect the other end to a SATA port on the motherboard. Hard drives use the same cables as optical drives.For easier troubleshooting, connect your hard drive to the first SATA port on the motherboard, and then connect your other drives to subsequent SATA ports. Avoid plugging your drives into random SATA ports.
SATA cables have the same connector on both sides. You can install the cable in either direction.

, Most modern motherboards have a 24-pin connector and a 4- or 8-pin connector. Both of these need to be connected for your motherboard to function. Power supply cables only fit into the slots that they are designed for. Push the connectors all the way in until the latch clicks.


The 24-pin connector is the largest connector on the power supply.

, If you have a dedicated video card, chances are it needs to be powered as well. Some require one connector, while others require two. The port is usually on the side or back of the video card.

, All of your drives need to be connected to the power supply using SATA power connectors. These power connectors are the same for optical and hard drives.

, One of the keys to good airflow is placing your wires out of the way. Trying to effectively wire the inside of the case can be a frustrating experience, especially if you are building a smaller tower. Use zip ties to bundle cables together and place them in unused drive bays. Make sure that the cables will not get in the way of any fans.

, Almost all cases come installed with one or two fans. These fans need to be attached to the motherboard in order to function.

, If you are running lots of high-end components, you will likely need extra cooling. 120mm and 140mm fans are typically fairly quiet and significantly increase airflow through your computer.

, Intake fans that suck air into the computer should be mounted in the lower front, bottom, and sides (a side fan is typically used to directly cool a specific component). Exhaust fans that blow air out of the computer should be mounted on the top and upper back of the computer as the hot air naturally rises through the inside. This keeps a good flow of fresh, cool air moving over your motherboard. You can see which direction the fan will blow by inspecting the top of the fan housing. Almost all fans have small arrows printed which shows which direction they blow. Try getting more intake than exhaust for less dust build-up, which looks grody and causes cooling problems. CPU/graphics card heat sink fans and power supply fans should also be counted as intake or exhaust fans depending on the direction the fans spin.

, It is highly recommended that you don’t run your computer with the case open. Cases are designed to maximize air flow, and when a case is open the airflow is not as effective. Make sure that everything is screwed close. Most cases use thumbscrews so that you don’t need tools to open and close the case.

, Attach a monitor to the computer, through the graphics card or the motherboard. Attach a keyboard and mouse to the USB ports in either the front or back of the computer.


Avoid plugging in any other devices until after you have finished setting up the operating system.

, You won’t be able to do much since you don’t have an operating system installed, but you can check to see that all of your fans are working and that the computer completes its POST (Power On Self Test) successfully.

, This program is available to download for free and can be booted from a CD or USB drive without an operating system installed. This will let you test your memory sticks before you proceed to install the operating system. Memory sticks have a higher rate of failure than most computer components, especially if they are budget-priced, so it is wise to test them first.


You may have to set your computer to boot from CD or USB first, instead of booting from the hard drive. Enter your BIOS settings when you first start the computer and then navigate to the Boot menu. Select the appropriate drive that you want to boot from.

, Home-built computers can install either Microsoft Windows or a Linux distribution. Windows costs money, but benefits from having compatibility with nearly every program and piece of hardware. Linux is free and supported by a community of developers, but cannot run many programs designed for Windows. Some proprietary hardware does not work properly either.

, Once your operating system is installed, you will need to install your drivers. Almost all of the hardware that you purchased should come with discs that contain the driver software needed for the hardware to work. Modern versions of Windows and Linux will install most drivers automatically when connected to the internet.

Most modern cases have thumbscrews on the back that allow you to easily remove the side panels, but you may need a Phillips-head screwdriver in order to remove the screws on older cases.


You should disconnect the power cable and all peripherals before removing the side panels.
Remove the panel on the opposite side of the motherboard. If you look on the back of your computer you will see a panel on one side that contains a variety of ports, including USB, Ethernet, display ports and more. This is the motherboard I/O panel, and will help you see which side the motherboard is located on. You can lay your computer on this side and remove the opposite panel so that you can easily access the motherboard.;
, Powerful video cards require a power supply that can give them the juice they need. If you're running an old power supply, or you have a lot of other components drawing power, your power supply might not make the cut. If this is the case, consider upgrading your power supply at the same time that you upgrade your video card.


There are a variety of sites online that help you calculate power requirements by analyzing all of the hardware currently installed or that you're planning to install. Search for ""power supply calculator"" using your favorite search engine.Your power supply will also need PCI-E connectors. This usually isn't an issue if your power supply is newer, but power supplies older than 10 years may not have the appropriate connectors.
Your power supply's maximum wattage should be printed on a sticker affixed to the power supply. You may need to remove the power supply to find it.

, Virtually all video cards are PCI-E these days, so you will need to ensure that you have at least one of these slots. They are typically located closest to the processor in the row of PCI slots. If you don't have any PCI-E slots, you may need to install a new motherboard if you want to upgrade your video card.


Refer to your motherboard's documentation to find the layout diagram. This will help you identify where the PCI-E slots are located.
Installing a new motherboard will require that you reinstall your operating system.
Note: Most laptops do not allow you to upgrade the video card.

, Lots of modern video cards are quite large, and many will take the space of two PCI slots in the computer. They can also be fairly tall and long, so you'll need to make sure that there is enough vertical and horizontal clearance.


Use a tape measure to note both the vertical and horizontal clearance that you have available. Nearly all cards will have their dimensions listed in their product descriptions, allowing you to ensure that it will fit before you purchase it.

, Video cards can get expensive. Obscenely expensive. At a certain point, the average user won't be gaining any benefits from the increased cost of higher-end cards. Examine the applications you intend to use your card with and find a card that gives you the best power and reliability for your buck.The more expensive cards are typically geared towards video card overclockers and users who want to use dual- or quad-card configurations.
Be sure to read as many reviews as possible before deciding on a card. There are lots of resources online for finding the best performance for your budget. Sites such as Tom's Hardware will publish comparison charts ranking the current most popular cards in all price ranges, and customer reviews on sites such as Newegg can provide insight into the average person's experience with the card.
Check the system requirements for your favorite games. See what video card is recommended to get the best performance out of the games you love, and also keep in mind the needs of future games.

, Different cards are best suited for different applications, though most cards excel at being jack-of-all-trades. below are some of the more popular cards as of 2015:


AMD Radeon R9 290X - This is a good all-around card that can run most games at Ultra settings without breaking a sweat. You can usually find these for around $300. The similarly performing Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 can be had for $50 more, though it has lower power usage.
AMD Radeon R7 260X - This is a low end card that can handle most games at Medium to High settings. You can snag this card for less than $120. The similarly performing Nvidia GeForce GTX 750 Ti can be had for $30 more, though it has lower power usage, and does not need a PCIe power connector (advised for PCs with lower-end PSUs).
Nvidia GTX 980 - This is one of the best high-end cards at the moment that can handle pretty much anything you throw at it at 1440p. It has a price to match too - about $550 for the EVGA ACX 2.0 and $680 for the Classified edition.
If you are focused on graphic design, look for cards with more onboard memory, such as 3 or 4 GB. These will be more expensive, but will increase your rendering and encoding speeds.

, As display technology improves, so do the number of options available on video cards. Your new card may support HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort, VGA, or any combination of those. Check what your monitor uses to connect, and purchase your card accordingly.


For the best possible quality, you will want to connect via HDMI or DisplayPort.
If you want top run multiple monitors, ensure that the video card can support multiple monitors with quality ports. You don't want one monitor on HDMI and the other on VGA, because the VGA monitor will be low resolution and look terrible next to the HDMI one.

, One of the biggest potentials for errors and problems stems from driver incompatibility. Before installing your new card, it is highly recommended that you uninstall the drivers that Windows is currently using to display graphics.The quickest way to uninstall your drivers is to open the Device Manager and uninstall from there. To open the Device Manager, search for it in the Start menu or press ⊞ Win+X and select it from the menu (Windows 8 only).
Once in the Device Manager, expand the Display Adapters section. Right click on your current display adapter and click Uninstall. Follow the prompts to remove the driver from your computer. Your display will likely revert to low quality, with large icons and blurry text. Power down your computer after uninstalling the drivers.

, Whenever working with sensitive computer components, you should always ensure that you are properly grounded. Electrostatic discharge can damage or destroy your components, rendering them useless. Preferably you will be using an anti-static wrist strap attached to exposed metal in your case. If you don't have one, you can ground yourself by touching a metal water tap.


Make sure that the open computer is not resting on carpet, and that you are standing on tile or linoleum when working inside the computer.
Make sure that the computer is unplugged from the wall before you begin working on the insides.

, You can find your old graphics card inserted into the PCI-E or AGP slot on your motherboard (AGP cards are typically found on older computers). Most video cards are fairly large, and will likely be the largest card installed in your system. They often have fans and heatsinks attached to them.


If your computer was using integrated graphics before (your monitor was connected directly to the motherboard), then there will be no card to remove.

, If you are upgrading video cards, you will want to remove the old card before installing the new one. Unscrew the screw that is connecting the card to the chassis. Most newer cards have a tab underneath near the back of the PCI slot that will need to be released in order to pull the card out.


When removing the card, pull it straight up so that you don't damage the PCI slot.
Make sure to disconnect any displayed plugged into the old card before removing it.

, With the old card out, this would be a great time to clean out some of the dust that's accumulated. Use compressed air to clear the dust from the crevices around the PCI slot. Dust can build up and cause your components to overheat, so staying on top of cleaning will help your computer run for a long time.

, Gently remove the card from its antistatic bag, avoiding touching any of the contacts or circuitry. Insert it straight into the empty PCI-e slot and apply even pressure to the top until it is fully seated. If you have a clip for your PCI-E slot, you will hear it click into place.You may need to remove the neighboring panel if your video card is two panels wide.
Make sure no cables or any other components are in the way before completely seating the card.

, Use case screws to secure the video card to the chassis. If the video card is two panels wide, you will want to secure it with two screws, one for each bay. Make sure the card is inserted completely before securing the screws.

, Most modern cards will have power supply connector ports built-in to the top of back of the card. You will need to connect one or two PCI-E connectors from the power supply, which are typically 6-pin cables. Without connecting the power supply, these cards will not work properly.


Many video cards come packaged with adapters that will change your existing connectors into ones that will fir into the video card.

, After you've verified that the card has been seated properly, secured, and been connected to the power supply, you can close up the case. Make sure to connect your display to the new video card. If you were using onboard video before, the monitor was likely plugged into the motherboard. In order to take advantage of your new card, your display will need to be connected to it.


For best results, use HDMI or DisplayPort to connect your display to your video card. If your monitor or card does not support HDMI or DisplayPort, the next best choice is DVI, followed by VGA.

, Your operating system will most likely detect the new card and attempt to adjust your display so that it is using the optimal resolution and color depth. Accept the changes and enter the operating system.


If your monitor does not display any picture at all, you need to troubleshoot your installation. Check to make sure you have the card properly installed and connected.
An irregular, jagged-looking or distorted picture might indicate a problem with your video card. Check that your card is properly installed before contacting the manufacturer.

, If your video card came with a driver disc, you can insert it now to begin the driver setup process. If your card did not come with a disk, or you want to ensure that you have the latest release of the drivers possible, you can download the drivers directly from Nvidia or AMD (depending on what card you have).

, The driver installation process is mostly automatic, though you may get asked if you want to install any additional video card management software. This additional software is optional, but can help ensure that your drivers stay up to date. Your display will most likely flicker and reset during the installation process.


Drivers contained on a disc are almost always out of date by the time they are purchased, so you will most likely be asked to update after installing them.

, Let's be honest: the reason you got this card is so that you can play the latest and greatest games. So what better way to test it out than to fire one up? Before starting to play, explore the game's Video settings menu. Turn all of the settings up as high as they can go and give the game a whirl. If it performs smoothly then you're good to go!


When setting the resolution, you should always try to keep it at your monitor's resolution. For most flatscreen monitors, this is 1920x1080, though newer monitors have a higher native resolution than that.
If the game is choppy or otherwise performing badly, start lowering settings one-by-one. Don't worry too much if your card can't handle the Ultra settings; sometimes games come out that don't work right with any card!
A game's performance is affected by more than just the video card. Your processor, RAM, and even hard disk speed will all play a part in how the game performs.

If you have a smartphone, iPhone or tablet, you will need a good mobile browser.,
Determine the features and capacity of the mobile browser could offer.,
Identify the best feature.,
Know the extensibility of the browser.,
Know the speed and efficiency of the application.",How to Find the Best Free Mobile Browser for Your Phone or Tablet," There are many browsers available, so how do you find the best one? Basically, it comes down to the varying features your phone browser can offer and how they will make your life easier. Let's look at an example of the Dolphin browser, which is free, to give you an idea of the features you can expect from a browser.;
, Dolphin is one of the most respected mobile browsers, because it has such a respected and trusted developer. The mobile web browser comes packed with all sorts of features designed to make your life easier and more fun. It is basically like having a little electronic friend, who gets to know you, anticipates your needs and learns from your behavior. It all sounds a bit high-tech, but that is basically what the Dolphin browser has to offer you.

Sit slightly reclined in your seat, allowing the chair to support your lower back. Ideally, your elbows should be angled down slightly to promote circulation. Your feet should be planted firmly on the floor.Standing desks are growing increasingly popular, but an improper desk can promote bad posture. Your standing desk should be elbow-level or just slightly lower. Your monitor should be eye-level to keep you from hunching over, and should be around two feet from your eyes.;
, When typing, your keyboard's spacebar should be centered to your body. This will help keep you from having to rotate to reach the keys.

, Your hands should float above the keys while you type. This will help you reach keys by moving your hands instead of stretching your fingers. Resting your palms or your wrist on the front of the keyboard and stretching your fingers promotes carpal tunnel syndrome

, Most keyboards are fairly sensitive and don't need much pressure for the key to register. Lightly tapping keys will help keep your fingers active and will improve your speed.


Keep your wrists straight as you type. Twisting your wrists can cause discomfort and unnecessary stress.

, When you're not actively typing, rest your hands. Keeping your hands tense when not typing can increase stiffness and soreness later.

, Nearly every computer has a word processor installed. Even a basic text editor like Notepad will work. This will let you see what you type while you practice.

, The Home position is where your hands will start when your typing, and where your fingers return to after striking a key. Most keyboards have raised bumps on the F and J keys. These indicate where your index fingers are placed.


Slightly arch your fingers, and place your fingers on the keys next to F and J.
Your left pinky rests on A, your left ring finger on S, and your left middle finger on D

Your right pinky rests on ;, your right ring finger on L, and your right middle finger on K.
Your thumbs rest on the spacebar.

, Get used to pressing each key with it's corresponding finger. Memorize the key that each finger rests on through repetition. You want the home keys permanently imprinted in your memory so repetition is essential.

, You can capitalize letters by holding the ⇧ Shift key when you press the letter. Use your pinky to press and hold the ⇧ Shift key using the hand that isn't pressing the letter, and then press the letter you want to capitalize.

, Once you have a good handle on the Home keys, you can start expanding to the other keys on the keyboard. Use the same repetition exercises to memorize the locations of the other keys. Use the nearest finger to reach the key.


If you are keeping your wrists elevated, you will be able to easily strike the keys that are slightly outside of your reach.

, Now that you are able to reach most keys without looking, it's time to start typing sentences. Try transcribing something else on your screen without looking at your keyboard. Sentences like ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"" contain every letter in the alphabet, allowing you to practice with all the keys.

, Punctuation marks such as ., ;, and "" are located on the right side of the keyboard. You can reach these keys using your right pinky. Many symbols need to have the ⇧ Shift key pressed in order to type them.


Symbols are located above each of the number keys that run along the top of the keyboard. You will need to have the ⇧ Shift key pressed in order to type them.

, While typing fast may seem useful, it won't matter if you're making a lot of errors. Speed will come with practice, so focus all of your efforts on avoiding mistakes. You'll be typing faster before you know it.


See this guide for more tips on learning how to type.

, There are lots of programs and games for all ages that teach typing skills through exercises and gameplay. These can making typing practice a bit more fun, and can do a lot for your accuracy and speed.

, The arrow keys ↑↓←→ are your main navigation keys on the keyboard. You can use them in a word processor to move around and between lines, use them on webpages to scroll, and use them in games to move around. Use your right hand to press the keys.

, You can quickly scroll through documents or webpages with the ⇞ Page Up and ⇟ Page Down keys. If you are using a word processor, these keys will move your cursor one page up or down from the cursor's current location. If you are viewing a webpage, these keys will scroll the page up or down one screen-length.

, You can move the cursor directly to the start or end of a line with the ⇱ Home and ⇲ End keys. These keys are most useful in word processors.

, The ← Backspace key will delete a character to the left of the cursor, while pressing Delete will delete a character to the right of the cursor.


You can also press ← Backspace to go back on a webpage.

, The Insert key changes the text input mode for your word processor. When Insert mode is toggled on any character you input will replace the character to the right of the cursor. With Insert mode toggled off, existing characters will not be replaced.

, Using a calculator program is the best way to get used to the keys on the numeric pad. You can use the numeric pad keys to perform calculations in the calculator program.

, When the numeric pad is not activated, the 8, 4, 6, and 2 keys will act as arrow keys. Press NumLock to enable the keypad.


Some laptop keyboards do not have a separate numeric pad. They often need to be activated using the Fn key, which changes keyboard functions.

, Like the main part of the keyboard, the numeric pad has a Home position. On the 5 key, you will feel a raised bump similar to the F and J keys. Place your right middle finger on the 5 key, and then place your right index finger on the 4 key. Place your right ring finger on the 6 key, and your thumb on the 0 key. Your pinky rests on the ↵ Enter key.

, Use your fingers to press the number keys. you will see the numbers appear in the calculator program. Use repetition to memorize the number placement and which fingers you use to press them.

, Around the edge of the numeric pad, you will see the basic arithmetic keys. These let you divide (/), multiply (*), subtract (-) and add (+). Use these keys to perform a variety of calculations.

, You can use your keyboard to quickly perform a variety of tasks in Windows. These are called keyboard shortcuts, and are built into nearly every operating system and program. These are especially useful if you can't use your mouse or for saving time digging through menus. Below are some of the most common shortcuts:Alt+Tab ↹: Switch between windows

For casual music listening, a pair of bookshelf speakers would be more than enough. Those who desire a more intensive experience can upgrade to standing speakers. Surround sound systems are also a high-end option.Subwoofers are additional speakers that add depth to bass, which is low tone. They’re good for movies and music with lower range such as rock and metal.For adding general depth to TV and movies, a soundbar or soundbase is an option. These take up less space, require less wiring, and can be combined with a subwoofer.
Wireless and wall-mounted speakers benefit from portability and offer new sound angles in your room.
For gaming, small specialized speakers usually offer enough sound. These are placed on a desktop near the computer and have magnetic shielding.;
, Different surfaces affect sound quality. Hard, flat surfaces reflect sound and soft or varying surfaces absorb sound. Sound is also easier to hear in a small room. To get a sense of the room, stand in the center and clap. The less the sound carries, the more powerful the speakers you’ll need.A small room such as a bedroom is fine with bookshelf speakers, but a large carpeted and furnished room benefits from bigger speakers.

, While bookshelf speakers will fit in a small bedroom, you wouldn’t want to try to fit wide standing speakers in there. The sound can overwhelm a small room even if it has lots of absorbent furnishings. On the other hand, if you want a surround sound system for your television, the speakers need space away from the wall and surround you.


Where you’ll put the speakers matters. Speakers inside a cabinet, for instance, can get muffled, but so do speakers in room corners since the sound is distorted by the walls.
Speakers benefit from being three to four feet away from the sound source. This helps them project sound into the room.
Try to keep your speakers around ear-level. At that level, the sound will be clearest to you., It’s very easy to fall into a price tag trap. You’ll see bigger and better-looking speakers or a salesperson will refer you to them even though quality isn’t completely related to price. A cheaper speaker may work better for you than a more expensive one. Stick to your budget as much as possible.


Once you’ve decided on the type of speaker you need, go online or shop around in stores to compare prices. Determine how much you’re willing to pay for the kind of speaker that seems right for you.

, If you intend on hooking the speakers to an old stereo system or receiver, you’ll use speaker wire. On the other hand, modern speakers and devices use improved cables or even operate in your home on Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.Speaker wire utilizes two wires that contain a positive or negative charge and end in various connectors. Some connectors plug into other devices while other connectors have to be clipped onto stereos., Traditional speakers don’t have amplifiers, especially small bookshelf speakers. If you have an amplifier, find the model number. Search online for your amplifier and note its power and resistance numbers. These numbers will be in labeled in watts and ohms.Always match speakers with amps to avoid damaging your electronics. The boxes of the speakers will have similar numbers to the amp or indicate they are compatible with your amp’s ohm and watt numbers.

, Impedance, measured in ohms, signifies how much the speakers resist the power sent by the amplifier. Search the box or instruction manual for the power numbers. Compare this to your amplifier, if you have one. Choose speakers that indicate they match your amplifier’s ohm level or are compatible with it.Most amplifiers are compatible with eight ohms. If you already know similar speakers work with your amp, you’ll be safe using these.
Lower impedance speakers require more powerful amps. If the speaker impedance is too low, the amp can overheat.

, Power handling is measured in watts. The larger the amount of watts the speaker can handle, the greater the sound signal. This too should be matched to your amplifier, if you have one. Higher watt speakers often require more powerful amplifiers.If your amplifier sends out more watts than your speaker uses, you can damage the speaker.

, The sensitivity is measured in decibels (dB). This indicates how loud the speaker’s sound can be. The higher the sensitivity, the more volume it can deliver in a watt of electricity. 80-88 dB is considered low and 100 dB high.A higher sensitivity usually means a more expensive speaker or one that sacrifices quality in other areas that affect sound, such as the speaker cone., Once you’ve found speakers, don’t buy them blind if you can help it. First rap your knuckles against the speakers. The speaker should feel solid and give you back a solid sound. If it sounds hollow now, it’ll sound hollow when you try using it to play your entertainment at home.If you’re buying speakers online, you can search for reviews or tests of the speakers, but to some degree you’re shopping blind.

, Check that all the plugs work, then listen to the sound. Stand close enough, about ear-level to the front of the speakers. Judge if the internal components give you the sound you desire. The tightness of the covering over the speaker as well as the material of the speaker cone change the sound. Listen for any distortion, fuzziness, or crackling.If the outer enclosure is wide or loose, the sound reverberates too much inside the speaker. If the enclosure is too tight, the speaker rattles and the sound distorts.Cones are made of varying materials such as aluminum and polypropylene and push out air to make sound. Turn the settings up to volumes and frequencies you’ll use at home in order to judge the speaker’s sound range.

, If possible, give the sound quality a personal test. Good test songs are ones you know well that you have available on a CD or other format where the song’s quality hasn’t been compromised. Queue up the tracks. Listen for sound quality as well as the problems, such as if the vocals and instruments sound off.


Test different features by using a variety of songs, such as ones that include a strong bass, quiet vocals, or instruments.
Quality speakers may help you experience parts of the songs you’ve never heard, including small details like fingers sliding on strings or covered-up instruments.
You may be able to use a music device such as an iPod, but transferring the song file to the iPod lessens the quality and doesn’t give you the most accurate speaker test.

, A home test puts the speakers in the environment you want. Set the speakers up where you intend on having them. Play your music, movies, TV shows, or whatever else you intend on listening to with them. This is a good time to play your music too if you didn’t do it before.


Relax. Even if the speaker seems impressive at first, stay attentive. Is this one you can listen to for a while, or does the sound quality make you want to turn it off?
Test it with your amplifier if you can. Speakers and amplifiers all have their own sound characteristics. The best combinations usually come from complementary qualities. For example, a mellow sound balances a bright sound.
Remember that sound quality is personal and objective. Your needs influence what speaker is right for you, so don’t let any salesperson pressure you into a decision.

, Before you buy the speakers, make sure the store has a friendly return policy. This is even more important if you’re shopping online, since you don’t get a chance to test the speakers in person and have to wait through shipping. Many companies will let you return the product for full price two weeks to a month after the purchase date.


Keep your receipt and original boxing on hand until you’re sure that you’re keeping the speakers.
Always keep and refer to the warranty information. The warranty gives you the right to quality assurance and a refund for a faulty product.
Most companies accept returns for manufacturing flaws and dissatisfaction, not damage related from installation, use, or wear and tear.

, To do so, slide the circular On/Off switch that's near the front of the mouse (on a green track) down. The green track should disappear when you do this.

, This tab is at the bottom of the mouse; sliding it down toward the rear end of the mouse will cause the cover to pop up.


If the cover doesn't come up when you slide the tab down, use something thin (such as a guitar pick) to pry the cover up while holding down the tab.

, Doing so will remove the cover and reveal the two AA batteries inside.

, This is easiest to accomplish if you use your fingernails or a thin plastic object to pry each battery out by its front or back end.


Never use a sharp metal object to remove batteries, as doing so will risk puncturing a battery or harming the mouse's internals.

, Both batteries will have the + ends facing the front of the mouse and the - ends toward the rear of the mouse.


Some Apple mouse users have experienced issues with Duracell batteries. For best results, try to find high-quality batteries (e.g., Energizer batteries)., You'll need to make sure that the slot for the black tab is aligned with the black tab at the bottom of the mouse.

, This will snap the cover back into place., Doing so will reveal a green track, and a small light in the top-right corner of the mouse's underside should come on, signifying that your mouse is on.

Find a speaker reconing kit.,
Disassemble the damaged speaker cone.,
Clean the air gap on the magnet.,
Cover the air gap with masking tape.,
Clean off all of the small particles of cone material.,


,
Assemble the new speaker.,
Allow the adhesive to dry for 24 hours.,
Flip the speaker back over and carefully pull out each shim.

,
Attach the dust cover.,
Solder the lead wires.",How to Recone Speakers," There are many kits available for specific speakers. If you can't find one, you may need to replace the speaker entirely.


Locate the make and model of the speaker on the magnet and find the corresponding kit at online vendor or at a specialty shop. The magnet is the large, heavy circular piece of metal on the back of the speaker housing. The cone-shape protrudes out from the magnet.;
,


Remove the speaker from the speaker cabinet.
Remove the gaskets. Use a chisel and hammer to get underneath the gaskets and pry them off.
Cut around the outer rim of the cone as well as by the base, near the dust cover, using a utility knife.
Cut around the edge of the spider and remove it. The spider is the piece that sits on the magnet. It is often a dark yellow color.
Remove the lead wires from the terminal. Apply heat from a soldering iron to remove them entirely, then clean the terminal using the soldering iron. To do this, hold the hot soldering to the terminal. The remaining solder should melt and stick the tip of the soldering iron.
Carefully remove the dust cover, which you should be able to lift right out.

,


If you have one available, use an air compressor and blow out any debris and dust from the air gap.
You can also clean the gap with a piece of masking tape. Fold a the piece of tape so that it is sticky on both sides and insert it into the air gap. Make sure you go around the entire circumference of the gap and insert the tape as deep as it can go.

, This helps prevent dust from getting inside once you are done cleaning it.

, Black particles from the old cone will still remain on the housing until you remove them.


Using a chisel or sharp scraper, carefully remove all pieces of cone and spider remnant from the speaker housing. Scrape every square inch and use an air compressor periodically to remove any loose pieces.
You can use a piece of medium- or fine-grit sandpaper to smooth out the surface.

,,


Remove the masking tape from the air gap on the magnet's voice coil.
Set the new cone in the air gap. Center it over the voice coil to make sure it fits correctly.
Remove the cone and apply adhesive. Run a bead of adhesive around the rim as well as the along rim at the bottom where the spider rests.
Carefully place the cone in the gap and apply a small amount of pressure.
Insert shims into the air gap in the voice coil to center the speaker. Space each shim around the whole gap to assure consistency. This step is very important. The speaker has to be centered correctly for it to function.
Attach the gasket. Apply a bead of adhesive around the top of the cone where the screw holes are. Be sure not to cover the screw holes with adhesive. Place on each section of the gasket, one at a time.

, Flip the entire speaker over so the gasket and the edge of the cone receive even pressure from the weight of speaker itself.

,, Apply a bead of adhesive around the base of the cone itself that is the same circumference as the dust cover. Place the dust cover in the center and apply a small amount of pressure. Allow the adhesive to dry for the duration of time specified on bottle.

, Attach the lead wires coming from the speaker to the terminal using your soldering iron."

AMD and Intel use different sockets, and both manufacturers use multiple socket types depending on the processor. Your motherboard's documentation will provide you the necessary socket information.


You cannot install an Intel CPU in an AMD motherboard, or vice versa.
Not all processors from the same manufacturer use the same socket.
You cannot upgrade the processor on a laptop.;
, CPU-Z is a freeware utility that can determine what kind of hardware you have installed. This is the easiest program to use to find your motherboard socket type.


Download and install CPU-Z from www.cpuid.com.
Run CPU-Z.
Click the ""CPU"" tab and note what is displayed in the ""Package"" field.

, Open your computer and find your motherboard's model number to look it up online.



Click here for detailed instructions on visually inspecting your motherboard.

, If you still cannot identify the socket type, remove your old processor from the motherboard and take it to a computer specialty store. One of the technicians should be able to tell you what socket type it is, and may be able to make recommendations on what processors would be good replacements.

, If you're tying to upgrade an older computer with a newer processor, there's a pretty good chance that the sockets won't match. As time goes on, getting a new processor that fits an older motherboard becomes more and more difficult. Purchasing a new motherboard along with your new processor will make things a lot easier.


Note: If you're upgrading your motherboard, you may also need to upgrade your RAM, as old RAM is often incompatible with new motherboards.

, In order to access your processor, you'll need to open your case. Shut down the computer and unplug all of the cables. Set the computer on its side with the back connectors resting closest to the table. Remove the sidepanel using a Phillips screwdriver or the thumbscrews.



Click here for more detailed instructions on opening your case.

, Make sure you are properly grounded before working inside your computer. Attach an antistatic wriststrap to the bare metal of your computer case, or touch a metal water tap.

, Virtually all processors will have a CPU cooler installed on top. This is typically a metal heatsink with a fan attached. You will need to remove this in order to access the processor.

, The inside of a computer can be a pretty crowded space, and there may be cables or components that are blocking part or all of the CPU cooler. Detach anything you need to in order to access it, but make sure you remember where everything was plugged in.

, Unplug the cooler from the motherboard and then detach it. Most stock coolers have four prongs that can be undone with your fingers or a flathead screwdriver. Some CPU coolers have a bracket on the back of the motherboard that must be removed first.


After popping the cooler off of the motherboard, it will likely still be attached to the processor because of the thermal paste. Gently twist the heat sink back and forth until it comes free of the processor.
If you're going to be reusing the CPU cooler on the new processor, wipe off the excess thermal paste from the bottom of the cooler with rubbing alcohol.

, This will pop the socket cover up and allow you to remove the CPU.

, Grip the CPU on the sides and make sure to lift the CPU straight up so as not to damage any of the delicate pins. You may have to angle the processor a little bit to get it out from under the socket cover, but make sure you are clear of the pins before doing so.


If you want to save your old CPU, make sure to store it in an antistatic bag. If you are storing an AMD CPU, try to press the CPU into antistatic foam as well to avoid damaging the pins.

, If you are upgrading your motherboard in order to use a new CPU, you'll want to do this first before proceeding. Remove all of the components and cables from your old motherboard, and then remove it from the case. Install the new motherboard in the case, using new standoffs if necessary.



Click here for detailed instructions on installing a new motherboard.

, Double-check that you are grounded before removing your new processor from the packaging. An electrostatic discharge can easily fry the processor, making it worthless.


Touch a metal water tap again if you aren't sure.

, Be sure to grip it by the edges and avoid touching any pins or contacts.

, Depending on the processor and socket you are using, you may have several notches around the edges or a small triangle in one corner. These guides are designed to ensure that you are installing your CPU in the correct position.

, After ensuring that you have the processor oriented correctly, gently place the processor directly in the socket. Do not insert it at an angle.


You should never need to force the processor into place. If you apply pressure, you may bend or break the pins, rendering the processor inoperable.

, once the processor has been properly inserted, close the socket cover over it and relatch it so that the processor is securely held in place.

, Before installing the CPU cooler, you'll want to apply a thin layer of thermal paste to the top of the CPU. This helps conduct heat from the processor to the CPU cooler by removing any imperfections on the contact surfaces.



Click here for a detailed guide on applying thermal paste.

, This process will vary depending on the type of cooler you are installing. Stock Intel coolers connect to the motherboard using four prongs, while stock AMD coolers are installed at an angle in metal tabs.


Make sure to plug the CPU cooler into the CPU_FAN connector on your motherboard. This will provide power to the cooler's fan.

, Before closing up your computer, make sure everything that you detached in order to reach the CPU has been properly reattached.

, Return the sidepanel to its position and secure it with screws. Place your computer back at your desk and connect all of the cables to the back.

, If you just changed the processor but kept the same motherboard, there's a good chance that your computer will boot normally. Open CPU-Z or your System Properties window (⊞ Win+Pause) to ensure that your new processor is recognized.

, If you installed a new motherboard, or installed a processor that is massively different than your old one, you'll likely need to reinstall your operating system. If you're having boot issues after installing the new processor, reinstalling your operating system should get you up and running again.Reinstall Windows 8

The motherboard tray can be removed from the case, which will allow you to easily install the motherboard without having to work at weird angles. Not all cases have removable motherboard trays.


The motherboard tray is typically held in with two screws. Set these aside so that you don’t lose them.
Installing a motherboard typically means you are essentially building a new computer. You will need to reinstall your operating system if you are upgrading, and you will need to format any system drives. You cannot simply upgrade to a new motherboard without reinstalling everything on your computer.;
, Before you begin working on the interior of your computer or handling the motherboard, make sure you discharge any electrostatic charge you may have. You can touch a water tap to discharge your electrostatic charge.


Wear an antistatic wrist strap while working on the computer to prevent causing electrostatic damage.

, This is located at the rear of the case, where the connectors for the motherboard extend out for your monitor, USB devices, and other peripherals. Most cases have a default panel shield installed, which will need to be removed and replaced with the panel that came with your motherboard.Apply pressure to all four corners of the panel to secure it into the case. It should snap into place.
Make sure that you are installing the panel in the correct direction. Compare it to the actual layout of the connectors on the motherboard to make sure it is going in the right way.

, Standoffs keep the motherboard above the case. This prevents it from shorting out and helps cooling. Some cases will come with standoffs, while others do not. Your motherboard should come with its own standoffs as well that you can use.

, Match the holes on the motherboard with the available standoff locations on the motherboard tray. Every case and motherboard tray is different, and all will have different hole configurations. Line up the motherboard to see where you can use standoffs to secure it. Every hole possible on your motherboard should have a standoff installed.


Most standoffs screw into their holes, but some are pushed in like pegs.
Not all motherboards will be able to attach with all of the available holes. Connect as many standoffs as possible, but never use any extra standoffs. Standoffs should only be installed in locations with a corresponding motherboard hole., The holes and the standoffs should all line up. If your motherboard tray does not come out of the case, you may need to gently force the motherboard against the I/O panel on the back of the case to fit it. Start securing the motherboard with screws.


Don’t overtighten the screws. Make sure it is firm but not too tight. Do not use an electric screwdriver.
Holes that don’t have metal on them will need cardboard washers between the screw and the motherboard. It is best to avoid using non-metallic holes at all.

, Before reinserting the motherboard tray with the newly-fastened motherboard into the case, install your CPU, CPU cooler, and RAM. Doing this now will make it much easier to reach everything. If your motherboard is not on a removable tray, install your components after wiring.

, Once the motherboard is secured, you can start connecting your components to it. It is recommended that you connect the power supply first, as the plugs will be difficult to reach later. Make sure that both the 20/24-pin connector is attached as well as the 4/8-pin 12V connector.


Refer to your power supply’s documentation if you are unsure which cables to use.

, In order to turn on your computer with the front power button or see when the hard drive is being accessed, you will need to connect the front panel switches and indicators. Locate the following wires and connect them to the appropriate pins on the motherboard:


Power switch
Reset switch
Power LED
Hard drive (HDD) LED
Speaker

, Connect any front USB ports to the appropriate connectors on the motherboard. These are typically labeled. Make sure the correct plugs are placed on the correct pints.

, Connect any case and CPU fans to the appropriate pins on the motherboard. There are typically several places to plug in chassis fans, as well as a two-pin connector near the CPU for the CPU fan.

, Once the motherboard is secure and connected, you can start attaching your drives to it. Make sure that you attach your SATA hard drives and optical drives to the correct SATA ports on your motherboard.

, One of the last components you should install is the video card. The card will take up the most space, and will make reaching other areas difficult. Installing a video card may be optional, depending on your system and needs.

, Now that everything is connected to your motherboard, it’s time to move that wiring around so that heat doesn’t get trapped or wires don’t get stuck in fans. Tuck excess cable into spare drive bays and use zip ties to bundle cables together. Make sure that all of your components have room to breathe., Return the side panels of the case to their original positions and screw them back in. Plug your computer and components in. Turn your computer on and prepare for operating system installation. Follow the guides below for specific instructions for your operating system:

This method only works for desktop computers. Laptop users will need to use one of the following methods, since you cannot easily access the motherboard on a laptop.;
, Rest it on the side so that all of the connectors on the back are closest to the table. These connectors are attached to the motherboard, and will help you determine if your case is laid on the correct side.

, Most cases these days have thumbscrews securing the panel, though older cases may require the use of a Phillips-head screwdriver. You can also use a screwdriver on the thumbscrews if they are too tight. These screws are typically located running along the edge of the back side of the tower.


After removing the two or three screws holding the panel in place, you slide it off or open it like a door, depending on the case.

, This is printed on the motherboard, but can be located in several possible locations. It may be printed near the RAM slots, near the CPU socket, or between the PCI slots. It may only be a model number without a manufacturer listed, but many modern motherboards will list both manufacturer and model.


There will be a lot of writing on the motherboard, but the model number is usually written in the largest text.
The model number may be obscured by installed components. Carefully unplug anything that's in the way, and ensure that you reconnect it after you are finished. If the computer hasn't been cleaned for awhile, dust may be obscuring the model number, which will need to be cleaned.
Motherboard model numbers are typically a collection of numbers and letters, usually between 5-7 digits long.

In Windows, you can uninstall drivers using the Device Manager. You can access the Device Manager by typing device manager into the Search bar in the Start menu or Start screen.
Expand the Display Adapters category in the Device Manager window. Right-click on the installed display adapter and click ""Uninstall"". Follow the prompts to uninstall the drivers from your system. Your display will most likely drop in quality and will become blurry.
Mac OS X users don't need to uninstall drivers before installing the new card.;
, Power down your computer after uninstalling the drivers. Once the computer has shut down, unplug all of the components from the back, and detach the power cable.

, Set the case on its side, with the connectors on the back closest to the table. These connectors are attached to the motherboard, and will help you determine which side of the computer you can access. Unscrew the screws securing the side panel of the computer.


Most modern cases use thumbscrews, though you may need a Phillips screwdriver for older cases or screws that are too tight.
For easy access, set the case on a table or workbench. Avoid laying it on carpet.
If the computer was running for a while before you turned it off, you may want to give the components time to cool before proceeding.

, Modern graphics cards almost always connect via the PCIe slot, which is typically located closest to the processor. You may have an old graphics card installed here, or it may be empty if you were using your motherboard's integrated graphics.If you are having difficulty identifying the PCIe slot, check your motherboard or computer's documentation.

, Whenever you are working with sensitive computer components, you should ensure that you are properly grounded. This will reduce the likelihood of of electrostatic damage to your components.


If possible, connect an electrostatic wrist strap to the bare metal of your computer's case.
If you don't have a wrist strap, you can discharge any built-up static charge by touching a metal water tap.
Make sure that you are wearing rubber-soled shoes while working in the computer.

, If you have an old graphics card installed, you will need to remove it before you install the new one. Unscrew the screw that secures it to the chassis, and then release the tab at the bottom of the card, near the rear of the slot.


When removing the card, pull it straight up (this is done by laying the computer case on its back, to make removing the old card and inserting the new card easier) to avoid damaging the slot. If the graphics card is tight, you may have to gently rock the graphics card to the left and right as you pull it up until it is free from the PCIe slot.
Make sure any displays are disconnected before removing the card, and that there aren't any cables attached from the power supply.

, While your computer is open and you have access to the inside, you should take this opportunity to clean out any dust that has built-up inside. Dust can lead to overheating, which can eventually lead to hardware failure.


Use compressed air or a small vacuum to remove as much dust and debris as possible. Make sure to get in all of the nooks and crannies.

, Remove your new graphics card from its antistatic bag, carefully gripping it on the edges. Be sure that you do not touch the contacts running along the bottom.


If you didn't have a card installed previously, you will need to remove the metal cover that covers the bay associated with the PCIe slot.
Insert the new card directly into the PCIe slot, applying even, firm pressure. You should hear the tab at the base of the PCIe slot click when the card is in place. Make sure that the screw holes line up on the chassis.
You may need to remove the neighboring panel on the rear of your case if your new card requires two bays.
Ensure that no cables or other components are in the way when you insert the card. you can detach other cables and then reattach them after the card is installed.

, Use case screws to secure the video card to the bay openings on the back of the case. If the video card is two bays wide, you will need two screws to secure it.


Make sure that the card is securely installed. When you put your computer back together, the card will be laying horizontally, so secure connections are important to prevent damage.

, Most modern graphics cards have one or two power connectors, typically located on the top of the card. You will need to connect these to the power supply using your power supply's PCIe connectors. If you don't have these connectors, many graphics cards come with Molex-to-PCIe adapters.

, Once you've inserted the card and attached all the necessary cables, you can close up the case. Make sure that you secure the case with the thumbscrews.


If you had to detach anything to make room for the graphics card, make sure to reattach them before closing the case.

, In order to take advantage of your new graphics card, you will need to plug your monitor into one of the display ports on the back of the card. For the best quality, use the HDMI or DisplayPort connector (if your monitor supports it). For older monitors, use DVI. If your monitor doesn't have a DVI cable, many graphics cards come with VGA-to-DVI adapters.

, Plug everything back into your computer and start it up. Your operating system should automatically detect your graphics card and attempt to configure it for you, but if it doesn't, download the drivers from the manufacturer's website or insert the driver disc if one comes with it. If you want to get the best performance out of your card, you should install the drivers for it.


If you install your driver from a disc, check for newer versions as they may be out of date. You can download the latest drivers from the manufacturer's website.

, Now that the card and drivers are installed, it's time to put it to work. Boot up your preferred testing program, be it a graphics-intensive game or a video encoder. With your new card, you should be able to bump the settings up and experience better graphics or faster encoding.


Game performance is affected by a variety of factors, including available RAM, processor speed, and even the amount of free hard disk space.

, Video cards are one of the largest draws on your computer's power supply, so you'll want to ensure that it is up to the task. You can see the wattage of your power supply printed on the sticker attached to it. Most video cards will say how much power they draw in their product specifications.If you don't have enough power, your hardware will likely not work correctly or your computer will not boot.
There are several power supply calculators online that allow you to enter all of your components and see how much wattage your power supply needs to put out.When choosing a power supply unit, avoid unreputable brands. Even if they are rated to support enough power for your computer, cheap power supply units may explode and damage everything inside of your computer including the new graphics card, even if the amount of power that the components of your computer are drawing stays well below the maximum amount of power that the PSU can give to them.

, This is less of a problem than it used to be, but if you are upgrading an older computer you may run into issues. Most modern motherboards have a PCI-E slot, which is what virtually all modern graphics cards use. Older motherboards may have AGP slots, which require a card that supports AGP as well.


Refer to your motherboard's documentation if you are unsure as to what your board supports.

, Many newer graphics cards are quite large, which can pose a problem for cases without much free space inside. Look up the card's dimensions, and then take a tape measure to the inside of your computer. Make sure that you account for length, width, and height.

, There are hundreds of different graphics cards on the market, ranging in price from $50 to over $1000. The first thing you need to do when deciding on a card is establish what you want to do with it. Find a good balance between price and power.If you aren't worried about pushing games to their limit and just want solid performance, you can find cards in the $100-$200 range that will suit your needs. A popular choice is the Radeon R9 270 or Geforce 750 Ti.
If you want to play most games at their maximum settings, look at cards in the $300-$400 range. A popular choice is the GeForce GTX 970 or Radeon R9 390.
If you need the best of the best, high-end cards are where its at. The average user won't notice much difference for the price, but overclockers and high-end PC builders will want these for the best performance possible. One of the most popular cards in this category is the GeForce GTX 980.
If you want one of the best graphics card, choose the GTX Titan X.
If you want an enterprise quality graphic card, choose the Quadro K6000.
If you are encoding video or doing graphic design, you will want a graphics card with lots of VRAM, either 3 or 4 GB.

You can download it for free from the CPUID website.You can also use a variety of other hardware monitor programs, including PC Wizard, HWMonitor, and AIDA 64.

, You will need to allow CPU-Z to run, as it requires administrator privileges. This is because it has to access a lot of low-level information, and most hardware options are disabled for non-administrators.


CPU-Z will take a few moments to start as it gathers information about your computer.

, This will pull up all the information for your motherboard. You can use the other tabs to find out other information about the hardware installed in your computer.

, You should be able to retrieve most motherboard information from this page. Occasionally, a motherboard will not be reporting correctly and nothing will display here. IN that case, you will need to open your PC and visually identify the motherboard.

Make sure you have all the tools needed for this project.,
Disassemble the phone to get to the keypad.,
Clean the circuit board where the keypad lays against, sometimes it can be very dirty (yellow stick goo) and sometimes it can look very clean, either way we are going to wipe it down!,
Put it all back together!",How to Replace a Keypad on a KX TGA400B and KX TGA200B," See Things You'll Need, below.;
, First you will need to take the battery cover off, and remove any battery inside. Once that is done you'll need to unscrew the two screws at the bottom corners. After you've done that use the flat head screwdriver to pry open the phone (it should snap open easily, do not be afraid to apply force if needed.) Once you have the back cover/shell off, you will need to undo the screw at the top left by the antenna, remove that screw and then pull the antenna upwards until it is no longer over the main circuit board. After that flip the circuit board (mother board) over and move it partially to the side (do not try to yank it away from the front cover/shell, the antenna is still attached.) Once it is flipped over you should be able to see the old keypad either stuck on the motherboard or sitting inside the key holes in the front cover/shell of the phone, either way remove it and throw it away!

, Take your cloth and dip it in a little bit of rubber alcohol and start cleaning the area of the motherboard that the keypad lays against (right under the LCD screen.) This could take several minutes if there is goo on it, but take the time to clean it up!

, Start by making sure the silver buttons are still inside the front shell/cover of the phone before you put the new keypad inside the key holes, once you know the two silver buttons are there, put the new keypad in where the old one was and start putting the phone back together (reverse the above steps.)

Work on an ESD mat.",How to Ground Yourself to Avoid Destroying a Computer with Electrostatic Discharge," Assemble or take apart computers on a clean, hard surface to minimize static buildup. A table, countertop, or a plank of wood will work fine.;
, Carpets and socks can give you a charge. Stand in bare feet on wood, tile, or other hard floors instead.You can wear rubber slippers to completely block your connection to the floor, but this is excessive for home projects.

, Wool and some synthetic fabrics are especially good at gathering static. Cotton clothing is a safe bet.

, Static electricity is a much bigger risk in dry environments. Run a humidifier if you happen to have one, but don't bother buying one if not. The other precautions should be more than enough on their own.You can also humidify by hanging wet cloth in front of a radiator or fan.

, All new computer components should stay in the antistatic bags they were sold in, until ready for installation.

, This must be unpainted metal with a clear ground path, such as a metal radiator. This is the quick and easy option, and many people build computers without taking any other precautions. That said, there's a small but definite risk that this will not be enough. Rely on this only if your project is quick and the components are not valuable.

, These cheap devices are sold at electronics stores. Wear the wristband tight against your skin, and clip the dangling end onto a grounded metal object. Many builders attach the wristband to the bare metal of the computer case instead. This should prevent problems if all your components are electrically connected, but all manufacturers recommend fully grounding your wristband.


Do not use a wireless wristband; these do not work.If you get a wristband with a loop (rather than a clip), it's easy to slip it over the center screw on a wall outlet plate. This is supposed to be grounded (at least in US code), but you may want to double-check with a multimeter.Double-check that the band is clipped to a conductive surface. Paint will slow or block conduction.

, This is not necessary if you are already grounded, but it's a good idea if you're relying on touching the computer case. The trick is to ground the computer without turning on the power. Choose a setup below that gives you 100% certainty that you will not accidentally restore power.Plug a surge protector into the wall and switch it off. Plug the power supply unit (PSU) into the surge protector with a grounded (three prong) plug.
Clip a bare metal area of the case to a grounded object with a grounding cable.
If there is a toggle switch on the back of the PSU, turn it off and plug the PSU into the wall.
(United Kingdom only) Unscrew the compartment of a grounded plug near the prongs. Remove the fuse so no power will flow, then plug in the PSU.

, This is above and beyond for most home projects, unless you value your peace of mind highly. Simply place the computer parts on the ESD mat, and touch it as you work. Some models will have a place to clip your wristband onto.


Go with a vinyl ESD mat for computer repair; rubber is more expensive and not necessary for this purpose. It should be rated ""conductive"" or ""dissipative,"" not ""insulative."""

Determine what connection you currently use.,
Check your available ports.,
Power down your computer.,
Attach the second monitor.,
Setup the monitor in Windows.,
Quickly switch between screen types.",How to Set Up Two Computer Monitors1," Look at the back of your computer where the monitor is currently plugged in. If the monitor plug is connected vertically towards the top of the computer, and is surrounded by various other connection ports like USB, Ethernet, speakers, and others, it is connected to the motherboard. If it is connected horizontally below the motherboard inputs, it is plugged into the graphics card.


Both monitors must be attached to the same graphics card. If your monitor is currently plugged into the motherboard, you will need to unplug it and plug it into the graphics card. If you don't have a graphics card, you will need to install one before setting up dual monitors.;
, Look at the ports available on your graphics card. These will determine the ways that you can connect your monitors, and will let you know whether or not you will need any adapters.


HDMI - This is the new standard in display connectivity, and can be found on virtually all computers built in the last five years. It looks like an elongated USB port. HDMI can transfer image as well as sound, and results in the best picture quality.
DVI-I/DVI-D - DVI (Digital Video Interface) has long been the standard way to connect a flat-panel monitor to a computer. DVI-I has a ""+"" connector on the right side, while DVI-D has a ""-"" connector. Both can be used to connect a DVI monitor to the computer, but only DVI-I can accept a VGA-to-DVI adapter. If a card has two DVI ports, generally only one of them will be DVI-I.VGA - VGA is an analog output, and was most common in the CRT-era of computer displays. It has largely been phased out of any recent hardware, but you may encounter it with older computers or CRT monitors.
DisplayPort - This is a digital connection, similar to HDMI. DisplayPort is necessary for 4K displays, and is not as common as HDMI.

, Your monitors will be easiest to configure if you power down your computer first. This isn't necessary for HDMI or DisplayPort connections.

, Attach your second monitor to your graphics card. Make sure that your primary monitor is connected to the best video output. For example, if you have an HDMI monitor and a VGA monitor, you'll probably want your primary monitor to connect via HDMI.


If you are using VGA or DVI, make sure to secure the cable with the built-in screws.

, Power on your computer and boot up Windows. Windows will automatically detect virtually any monitor. Right-click the desktop and select Screen resolution. If you are using Windows XP, right-click the desktop, select Properties, and then click the Settings tab.


Use the ""Multiple displays"" drop-down menu to indicate whether you want to extend your desktop, duplicate your display, or keep the desktop on a single display.
Extending your desktop allows you to move windows icons, and other objects between your screens.

When the monitor is turned on, you should hear a distinctive ""dwoing"" sound. If you hear no sound when you turn the unit on, it may not degauss itself automatically. If that is the case, proceed to the next step.

, This may be combined on an EXIT button. Otherwise, locate the menu button on the front of the monitor.

HDMI - This is the new standard in display connectivity, and can be found on virtually all computers built in the last five years. It looks like an elongated USB port. HDMI can transfer image as well as sound, and results in the best picture quality.
DVI/Mini-DVI - DVI (Digital Video Interface) has long been the standard way to connect a flat-panel monitor to a computer. Mini-DVI is an Apple-specific connection that acts like DVI but in a smaller form.
VGA - VGA is an analog output, and was most common in the CRT-era of computer displays. It has largely been phased out of any recent hardware, but you may encounter it with older computers or CRT monitors.
DisplayPort/Thunderbolt - Macs have been using DisplayPort technology for much longer than most PCs, and the new Thunderbolt connector is an evolution of that. DisplayPort monitors can plug into both DisplayPort and Thunderbolt outputs, while a Thunderbolt monitor can only work on a Thunderbolt output.Adapters - There are several adapters available for users that need to connect a monitor to a different port on their mac. Some of the more useful adapters include: Thunderbolt-to-HDMI, VGA-to-DVI, Mini-DVI-to-DVI, and DVI-to-HDMI.

, Power down your Mac first if you are connecting a VGA or DVI monitor. Otherwise, you can just plug it in. If you are using VGA or DVI, make sure to secure the cable with the built-in screws.

Check your ports.,
Attach the second monitor to the open port on your computer.,
Follow the monitor setup wizard.,
Setup the monitor manually.",How to Set Up Dual Monitors1," You will need two video out connections on the back of your computer, one for each monitor. There are 4 main types of connections, listed from oldest to newest: VGA, DVI, HDMI and Display Port. For best results, use two of the same connectors for your dual monitor setup.


Monitors are typically connected to either the motherboard or the graphics card. Most graphics cards support two or more monitor connections, while most motherboards support one and sometimes two.
If you have a monitor with a VGA cable, and your port is DVI, you can purchase an adapter that will attach to your VGA connecter and allow you to hook it up to a DVI port.
The ability to set up dual monitors depends on the power of your graphics card and CPU. Running a second monitor puts more strain on your system. A more powerful graphics card means the display has more pixels, which makes a dual setup possible.;
, In most cases Windows will automatically detect the new monitor. If it doesn’t, restart the computer.


If you want to connect a second monitor and there is only one port on your motherboard or graphics card, you will need to install a new graphics card in order to attach the second monitor.
The monitor does not need to be the same manufacturer or size. For easiest viewing, use two monitors that are the same size so that your desktop stays uniform.

, In most cases, this will start automatically when a new monitor is plugged in. You will be given options to either mirror or extend your desktop.


Mirroring duplicates what is shown on your primary monitor. This is most useful for giving presentations, where your laptop may be connected to a projector or TV.
Extending makes the second monitor another screen for your desktop. This will allow you to drag windows and icons onto the second monitor, giving you more room to multitask.
You can also set the second monitor as your primary desktop monitor. This is useful if you attach a monitor to a laptop and want to use it instead of your laptop's display.

, If the monitor wizard does not automatically start, or you want to change the settings yourself, you can use the Display Settings tool.


Right-click the desktop, and select Properties or Personalize. Select Display Settings from the list of preferences.
You should see icons with numbers representing your attached monitors. If one is disabled, it will be grayed out.
Select the second monitor and choose to either extend your desktop or mirror your desktop.
Your options may be dependent on the graphics card that you have installed. You may need to make these changes from within your nVidia or ATI control panels. If you have these installed, they can be found in your Start menu.

VGA - This is the older analog standard, and almost all monitors support being connected via VGA cables.
DVI - This is a step up from VGA in quality, but is being replaced by HDMI and DisplayPort. A very small number of MacBooks use Mini-DVI, which requires an adapter to connect to a standard DVI cable.
DisplayPort/Thunderbolt - This is one of the more common connectors found on newer Macs. Thunderbolt is there newer version of DisplayPort, and can carry audio signal as well as video. If your monitor only supports HDMI, you'll need a Thunderbolt-to-HDMI adapter.
HDMI - This is the standard for all digital display devices. Almost every new display manufactured in the last few years supports HDMI connections. HDMI can carry audio as well as video signal.

, Most displays will be recognized automatically and you will be prompted to choose your preferred settings. If you choose to mirror, the same image will be shown on both monitors. If you choose extend, then your desktop will stretch across both monitors.

Consider the size of the room you'll be presenting in.,
Get an estimate of how big an audience you'll have.,
Find out how bright the room or venue will be.,
Look at the nature of your presentation (is it highly technical, with lots of charts and graphs?,
Confirm that the connectors on the projector are compatible with your video source (such as a laptop).,
Some projectors have built-in speakers which are more powerful than typical laptop speakers and good for presentations but not impressive for music or movies.,
All but the most expensive DLP projectors display one of the three primary colors at a time in very quick succession.",How to Select a Rental Projector,";
, The greater the audience, the bigger the required image for viewing. The larger the image, the higher lumen count that is required to maintain clarity of the images.


Small to mid-size audiences are well-served with a 2000-lumen projector, while larger audiences (100+) require a 3000-lumen projector for crisp, clear image projection.

,


Outdoor daytime presentations typically demand a high-lumen projector.
If you’re presenting indoors, odds are there will be at least some ambient light (to assist your attendees in note-taking, finding their way out of the room to take a call or use the bathroom, and to help you maintain eye contact with the participants).
Generally speaking, if the room is exceptionally dim (almost completely dark), then a low-lumen projector would suffice.
Most presentation environments feature dimmed ambient light, which makes a 2000-lumen projector a wise choice.

, Or are you merely featuring talking points and text with your audiovisuals?)


Highly detailed charts or graphics may require higher lumen counts, while less detailed images and large-font text are well served with a 2000-lumen rental projector.

, Most computers have a ""VGA"" connector. Some have a digital DVI or HDMI connector, which avoids the signal being converted from digital to analog to be sent down the cable (which was designed for old CRT monitors) and back to digital again, which can cause slight signal deterioration--it's not a big deal, but nice to avoid. Check that you have, or obtain, the correct video cable.

, The audio signal needs to get from the audio/video source to them -- check that you have a proper cable if relevant.

, Some people notice the flickering. LCD projectors can have somewhat less vivid colors and slight ghosting with rapid action in videos (neither is generally noticeable except to video experts) but avoid the flickering.

, This should be located towards the bottom of the window. By default, it will say ""Landscape"" for most computers. Most graphics cards will allow you to rotate the screen using this menu.

, There will be four options to choose from:


Landscape - This is the default option for standard monitors.
Portrait - This will rotate the display 90° to the right so that the right edge of the monitor is now the bottom of the display.
Landscape (flipped) - This will flip your screen upside down so that the top edge of the monitor is now the bottom.
Portrait (flipped) - This will rotate the display 90° the opposite, so that the left edge becomes the bottom of the display.

, Some graphics card adapters support shortcuts to change the display orientation. You can use these shortcuts to quickly switch between orientation modes. These shortcuts are most likely to work if you are using an Intel integrated graphics adapter. For many users of Nvidia or AMD cards, these shortcuts will not work.



Ctrl+Alt+↓ - Flip the screen upside down.

Ctrl+Alt+→ - Rotate the screen 90° to the right.

Ctrl+Alt+← - Rotate the screen 90° to the left.

You can usually access this control panel from the menu tat appears when you right-click the desktop, but you may have to find it in the Start Menu or the Windows Control Panel.


Look for the ""Rotate"" or ""Orientation"" option. In the Nvidia control panel, look for the ""Rotate display"" option in the left menu. In the AMD Catalyst Control Center, you can find the ""Rotation"" menu in the Desktop Properties section. For Intel, you can find the ""Rotation"" selector in the ""Display Settings"" menu.

Make sure to check the boxes to enable your new hotkeys.

, If you aren't seeing any rotation options and the shortcut keys aren't working, you may be able to enable the function by updating your video card drivers. You'll want to download the latest drivers directly from the manufacturer instead of using Windows Update.


AMD and Nvidia have hardware detection tools that will automatically detect the graphics card you are using and provide the latest drivers. You can run these tools from their driver download pages, or you can search for your specific model if you know it.
If you want to look up what model graphics adapter you have, press ⊞ Win+R and type dxdiag. Click the ""Display"" tab to see your graphics adapter manufacturer and model.

If a high-contrast display is important to you, choose a glossy LCD display., Glossy displays are more susceptible to glare. When choosing between a matte and glossy LCD display, you should consider the potential for glare. Glossy screens are more reflective than matte screens. This means a glossy screen will have more glare when exposed to light than a matte screen., If you plan on primarily using the screen indoors, consider going for a glossy LCD display. This type of display is well suited for playing video games, watching films, or editing photographs. A glossy LCD display is a good choice if you plan on viewing the screen indoors, or in a space that has little potential for glare from windows or lightbulbs., A glossy LCD display is more likely to show fingerprints and smudges than a matte display.

Be ready to pay more for a matte display.",How to Choose Between a Matte or Glossy LCD Display2," A matte display will have less glare than a glossy display when exposed to external light sources. This is because the surface of a matte display is less reflective than a glossy display. If you are worried about glare, and the potential eye strain that accompanies it, go for a matte display., If you plan on using your phone, laptop, or other LCD display outdoors, consider a matte display. Because the surface of a matte display is less reflective, it will be easier to read outdoors than a glossy display. You should also consider a matte display of you will be using the device in an indoor setting with lots of light., If you find fingerprints and smudges unsightly, a matte LCD display might be a good choice for you. Matte displays do not appear dirty as quickly as glossy displays, and are easier to clean., When a manufacturer puts an anti-glare coating on a matte LCD display, it increases the overall cost of the product. This cost is then transferred to the consumer, meaning you will end up paying more for a matte display in most cases. This should be taken into consideration when choosing between a matte or glossy LCD display."

Compare LCD monitors by screen size when you begin your search for a new monitor.,
Look at the resolution offered by the LCD monitor.,
Watch for the contrast ratio somewhere on the LCD monitor packaging or information pamphlet.,
View the angles at which the LCD monitor is easily viewable.,
Find an LCD monitor with a higher refresh rate.,
Watch out for LCD monitors that don’t have the connectors you need to hook up to your current computer.",How to Compare LCD Monitors,"


LCD monitors are sold by actual size meaning the real dimensions of the screen are listed as the LCD screen size.
Consider the space you have available when choosing which size screen you want. The 15 to 19-inch screen LCDs are the most popular, but LCD monitors do come in even larger sizes.
Find out what the screen ratio is while you look at screen size. Compare LCD monitor’s display capabilities as well. Some are sold as the typical 4:3 dimension displays while others now display a wide-screen option just like televisions.;
,


The resolution number refers to the highest number of pixels the monitor can display. The higher the resolution number, the better quality picture you’ll have on the computer monitor.
A monitor should also be able to display different resolutions. This standard is called a VGA or SVGA and refers to the different dimensions the monitor is capable of displaying.

,


The contrast ratio is measurement from the brightest to the darkest parts the screen can display. Higher ratios show the LCD monitor will show deep blacks and bright whites better.

,


LCD monitors work using pixels which are most easily seen straight on. If the monitor is turned slightly one way or another, viewing will be distorted and washed out. Look for a high rating.
The angle rating is usually listed in degrees. The optimal, but usually impossible, viewing angle would be 180 degrees. The 180-degree viewing angle would mean the screen could be visible from anywhere in front of it without distortion.

,


The refresh rate refers to the amount of times the screen will refresh itself to allow for as clear a picture as possible. LCD monitors with a refresh rate in the 70s will show a very clear picture without the presence of flickering caused by slower refresh rates.

,


The most common LCD connector is the DVI digital connection (white connector).
Some newer LCD monitors may have an HDMI or DisplayPort connector which is a digital connection that allows for a clearer, brighter picture. The digital connection may not work with very old computers without the proper converter cables.
Most monitors still carry legacy analog VGA connectors (DSUB-15 or HD15). This is the connector used on older CRT monitor. You will also use this if you use your motherboard's integrated video.

Go for IPS/PLS panel technology if you’re aiming for the best overall quality.,
Get a higher resolution if you want a bigger screen.,
Pay attention to refresh rate and response time if you value video.",How to Choose a Computer Monitor1," There are three main types of panels: twisted nematic (TN), vertical alignment (VA), and in-plane switching or plane-line switching (IPS/PLS). All three use LCD technology and generally, the quality and expensiveness for these options increase in this order.IPS/PLS is an especially good choice for photographers and graphic designers, because their color accuracy and angle viewing capabilities are top notch.
One weakness of the IPS/PLS panel is that its refresh rates are a bit slower, which can be an issue for frequent gamers.;
, Typically, the bigger the display, the higher the resolution. Resolution is the number of picture elements, or pixels, that make up each image that you view on your monitor. More pixels means more detail, and more detail is needed if you’re viewing on a greater surface.


Typical resolutions range from 1,440x900 to 2,560x2,440 and even higher, often depending on the monitor’s screen size., Refresh rate is the number of times a second that the monitor can update the image. Response time measures how fast the monitor can update from one frame to the next. These determine how blurry and choppy or clear and smooth videos appear on your monitor."

Different consoles have different display needs. If you want to experience the game as it was intended to be played, try to get the best monitor for the job.


You'll get the best image for newer consoles like a PS4 or Xbox One if you use a full High Definition (HD) 1080p monitor. Connecting HD consoles to a CRT (tube) will result in a blurry mess.Older consoles that don't output in HD will actually look better on older CRT monitors. Using a CRT for a system like an NES or Sega Genesis will give you a much more accurate image. Besides the image quality, it will improve your control in the game. This is due to the high refresh rate of the CRT monitor. The refresh rate is how fast the monitor updates the image on the screen. Connecting an older console to an HD monitor can result in poor control due to the low refresh rate. The image will also be stretched.;
, This is the most important thing you'll need to know before you start connecting your console. Most modern monitors support HDMI and DVI connections. Some have VGA support. Older monitors may only have VGA and DVI, or VGA only. Very few monitors will have composite (RCA) support, which is what many older consoles use. Most modern consoles can be connected via HDMI. Most monitors have connection ports on the back. Many budget monitors only have one connection port. Older monitors may not have a removable cable.


HDMI - This looks like an elongated USB plug with notches at both ends. It is the most common connector for modern monitors and consoles.
DVI - This 24-pin connector is another common connector for monitors. It is not used for any video game systems. Luckily you can get converters.
VGA - This is the old standard for monitors. Its 15 pin connector is typically blue. Most new monitors will not have this connector. No consoles support this, but you can get converters.

, Different consoles have different methods of connecting to a display. HDMI is the newest method, while the oldest are RCA and RF.


PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U - All of these consoles support HDMI. The only exception is the launch version of the Xbox 360. These consoles also support component cables, though very few monitors do.
Wii, PS2, Xbox, Gamecube, Nintendo 64, PS1, Super Nintendo, Genesis - These all support composite cables. The Wii, PS2, and Xbox also support component and S-Video, though it will be tough to find a monitor that does. The older consoles also support RF (coaxial) connections, which are essentially non-existent on monitors.

, If your monitor has speakers, you may be able to get the audio from your console to play through them. Most monitors don't have speakers, however, so you'll need to have something that can play the audio from the console. You'll need a converter to connect your console's audio cable to your speakers or headphones. If you're connecting via HDMI, you'll need a separate audio cable since the HDMI can't connect to speakers.

Newer consoles like the PS4 may only support digital/optical audio output if you're not using HDMI for audio, which means you'll need a converter to connect to speakers.
If you're using a PS4 and headphones, you'll be able to connect a pair of headphones directly to your controller, which means you won't need any converters or extra cables.

, You'll need something to convert to HDMI or DVI to connect an old console to a new monitor. There are many converters available. You can get boxes that support multiple old consoles with a single HDMI or DVI output to your monitor.


Some video converter boxes may support audio connections as well.

, Most consoles only come with one video cable. Your PS3 may have come with a composite cable, but it supports HDMI. Get the cable that you need to make the easiest and best-quality connection to your monitor.


HDMI cables work the same for all devices that support HDMI. Older connection types will require a cable that connects to your specific console. For example, you can use the same HDMI cable with your Xbox 360 and PS3, but if you are connecting using component cables you'll need console-specific cables.
If your console is HDMI only, and your monitor only supports DVI, you can get an HDMI-to-DVI converter or special cable.

, If you're using HDMI, you'll have the easiest time connecting your console. Plug the HDMI cable into your console and the other end into your monitor.


Skip down to the next section after connecting to get your audio working.

, For most older consoles you'll be connecting to the monitor through a converter box. Match the colors of the plugs into the converter box. Make sure the console's plugs are all in the same INPUT group on the converter box.


Many converter boxes have a pass-through to connect to your computer. This allows you to switch your monitor's display between your computer and your console. If your box supports this, make sure to connect the box to your computer's monitor port.

, Use the HDMI, DVI, or VGA cable (depending on the box) to connect the monitor to the converter box's OUTPUT or MONITOR port. Make sure that the monitor is turned off if you're plugging in a VGA cable.

, Select the correct input to see your console's display. If you only have one input, you should see your console as long as the monitor and the console are turned on.

, The audio cable will likely need to be console-specific. You can use a composite or component cable to transfer the audio signal when connecting via HDMI. Newer consoles may only support a separate optical connection for audio.

, Most converter boxes will have an input and an output. Connect the two audio cables (Red and White) to the matching plugs on the Input side of the box.

, Match up the speaker plugs by color if you are connecting computer speakers. If connecting headphones, use the green plug on the converter. Some converters only output to a single plug, in which case simply plug your speakers or headphones into it., You'll need to adjust your console's settings so that it outputs sound through the audio cable instead of the HDMI cable.


The process for changing your console's audio output varies depending on the console. Generally, you can find this option in the Audio settings in your console's main Settings menu.

Learn some common terms.,
Find the native resolution of your monitor.",How to Check Your Screen Resolution1," There are a few terms that will help you when you're changing your screen resolution:


Pixel - A pixel is a small point of light in your monitor that changes color depending on what's being displayed. All of the pixels in your monitor work together to display the image that you see.
Resolution - This is the ""size"" of your display measured by pixels. For example, the resolution ""1366 x 768"" means that the display is being shown at 1366 pixels horizontally and 768 pixels vertically. At higher resolutions, objects on the screen will be smaller and sharper.
Native (recommended) resolution - This is the physical number of pixels in your monitor, and is usually the highest resolution that can be displayed. Selecting this resolution will result in the clearest image.
Aspect ratio - Since widescreen monitors are very common this isn't as big of an issue anymore. The aspect ratio is the ratio between the width and height of the monitor. Old CRT monitors and early flat panels were 4:3. Nearly all modern monitors are 16:9. 16:10 ""cinematic"" monitors are becoming popular as well.

, Knowing the native resolution of your monitor will help you quickly get the clearest image. In Windows 7, 8, and most versions OS X, the recommended resolution will be labeled. Below are some common resolutions for monitors:


Desktop widescreen monitors are usually 1920 x 1080, though 2560 x 1440 and 3440 x 1440 are becoming more popular. Older 4:3 flat panels may be 1280 x 1024.
Laptop monitors are usually 1366 x 768, though 1280 x 800, 1600 x 900, and 1920 x 1080 are also common.
MacBook Pro 13""s (2012 and later) have a resolution of 2560 x 1600. Full-size MacBook Pro Retina displays are 2880 x 1800.
""4K"" desktop monitors are usually 3840 x 2160. iMac 5K displays are 5120 x 2880.

Buy a 22, 24, or 27 inch display for general use.,
Get a curved screen if you’re also leaning towards a larger one.,
Get a stand with decent adjustment options.",How to Choose a Computer Monitor2," This is a good default size for a screen that allows you to do and enjoy everything from typing word documents to watching movies. However, if you have the space, it’s never a bad idea to go a little larger. Display size is measured in inches and diagonally from a top corner to a bottom corner, not horizontally.


Only consider getting a display smaller than 20 inches if you’re very pressed for space, limited financially, or if you typically just stick to office work., Consider getting a curved screen if you’re getting a monitor that measures 27+ inches. The biggest appeal of a curved screen is that it allows you to see more without being far away from the computer.If you only do basics on your computer, such as run-of-the-mill internet searches and typing, this may be an excessive and unnecessary feature.
Music Producers especially benefit from having a curved screen because they can see a longer chunk of a song at any given moment.

If price isn’t much of an issue, consider getting a 27 inch flat screen with 4K (3,840x2,160) resolution that uses an IPS/PLS panel.
A more affordable option is a slightly downgraded version of this with a 24 inch screen with 1,920x1,080 (FDH) resolution., The bigger the screen, the better the gaming experience. Also, video games are a lot more enjoyable when you aren’t dealing with lagging.


Get a monitor with a large, curved screen that has a response time of five milliseconds or less.

, If you’re a photographer or graphic designer, you’ll need the biggest possible screen, the best possible resolution, and a monitor that uses an IPS/PLS panel.

Wipe the cloth against the screen in a circular motion.",How to Clean a Laptop Screen with Household Products2," Since you're using a liquid to clean the screen in this method, it's important to turn off the computer and unplug it from the outlet., The ideal solution is plain distilled water, which contains no chemicals and is gentle on the screen. If heavier cleaning is needed, a 50/50 mix of white vinegar and distilled water can also be effective.


Make sure you use plain white vinegar, not apple cider vinegar or any other kind.
Distilled water is better than tap water because it's chemical-free.
Manufacturers no longer recommend using any cleaners with alcohol, ammonia or any strong solvents on LCD screens.

, This is the the type of spray bottle that you push from the top to get a fine mist, similar to a perfume bottle. Pour some of the solution into the spray bottle and screw on the top. Don't use this to spray on the screen itself, however.

, A static-free, fiber-free cloth works best. Remember not to use regular cloth, since this could scratch the screen. Do not soak the cloth; you just want to get it moist, which is the purpose of using the atomizer bottle to wet it.


A wet cloth can drip or run when cleaning the screen and the solution can weep behind the bezel and permanently damage your screen.
Try applying the solution to just one corner of the cloth at a time, to make sure you don't get it too wet.

, Rapid circular movements generally eliminate streaks. Apply a gentle and even pressure to the cloth. Use only enough pressure to keep the cloth in contact with the screen. Take care not to press your fingers into the cloth or screen, since applying too much force when cleaning the screen can permanently damage the LCD matrix and render your screen unusable.


Hold the screen toward the very top or very bottom to avoid re-smudging it as you work.
You may need to pass over the screen multiple times before all the smudges have been removed. You may also need to re-dampen the cloth as you work, depending on how many passes over the screen you need to make.

However, you will want to balance the size of the monitor against the available space on your desk. Unlike televisions, larger is not always better for computer monitors. Currently, typical computer monitors are sized between 17 and 23 inches.

, HD LCD monitors operate on a grid of pixels, which means that each monitor has a ""native"" resolution at which it looks the best and the most crisp. Typical household monitors these days will have a native resolution of 1600x900 or 1920x1080, but larger monitors can go as high as 2560x1600.

, Contrast ratios under 400:1 will be sub-par and anything over 600:1 will probably be unnoticeable except to the trained eye. As for brightness, most monitors have at least 250 cd/m2 (candelas per square meter), and that should be sufficient for most typical users.


Brightness determines how dim or how bright your monitor can be, while contrast determines how well your monitor can differentiate between dark and light colors.

, Ever since digital technology has made significant advancements, there really is no need to choose analog over digital unless your PC does not have a digital connector port. DVI ports are digital while VGA ports are analog. Consult your PC manual to see which ports are available before making a decision.

,


Response time is the time it takes for a pixel on the monitor to change color. During high framerate activities (like playing video games), a slow response time will result in blurry motion.
Physical adjustments can be convenient. Sometimes you may wish to tilt your screen up or down, or maybe you'll want to angle it side to side. While not necessary, ease of adjustment can positively impact your enjoyment of your monitor.

, The process for this will vary from site to site, but generally you can browse or search for a specific model. Find the support page for the specific piece of hardware you need to update.

, Many drivers come as installers (.exe files), or are packaged with software designed for the hardware. Older or less common devices may have drivers in .zip format. Sometimes the hardware's accompanying software will be listed separately from the drivers.If there isn't a driver available for your version of Windows, you can try one from an earlier version. For example, if you're looking for a Windows 10 driver but there isn't one available, try the Windows 8 driver. This isn't guaranteed to work, but may be your only option.

, If you downloaded an .exe file, you can run it and follow the installer's prompts to install the drivers. If you downloaded a .zip file, double-click it to open it, copy the files into an easy-to-access folder, and read on.


If you use an installer, you'll likely be prompted to reboot your computer after the installation is complete. You usually don't need to install any of the additional software unless you want it.

Turn on the SLI visual indicator.",How to Establish Nvidia SLI," Two-card SLI is supported on Windows Vista, 7, 8, and Linux. Three- and four-card SLI is supported in Windows Vista, 7, and 8, but not Linux.;
, SLI requires a motherboard with multiple PCI-Express slots, as well as a power supply with enough connectors for multiple graphics cards. You will want a power supply that outputs at least 800 watts.


Certain cards allow up to four simultaneous cards running in SLI. Most cards are made for two-card setups.
More cards means more power required.

, Almost all recent NVidia cards are capable of being installed in an SLI configuration. You will need at least two cards of the same model and memory to be installed as SLI.


The cards do not need to be the same manufacturer, just the same model and memory amount.
The cards do not need to be the same clock speed, though you may see a decrease in performance output if the speeds are not the same.
For best results, use two identical cards.

, Install the two cards in the PCI-E slots on your motherboard. The graphics cards are inserted into the slots as normal. Take care not to break any tabs, or insert the cards at odd angles. Once the cards are inserted, secure them to the case with screws.

, All SLI-capable boards should come packaged with an SLI bridge. This connector attaches to the top of the cards, and connects the cards to each other. This allows the cards to talk directly to each other.


The bridge is not required for SLI to be enabled. If there is no bridge present, the SLI connecting will be made through the PCI slots of the motherboard. This will result in reduced-performance.

, Once you have your graphics cards installed, close up your case and reboot your computer. You shouldn’t need to make any settings changes until after Windows or Linux loads.

, Your operating system should automatically detect your graphics cards and attempt to install drivers for them. This process can take longer than a single graphics card installation because the drivers need to be installed for each card separately.If the installation doesn’t start automatically, download the latest drivers from the NVidia website, and run the installation file once the download is complete.

, Once your drivers have finished installing, right-click on your desktop and select NVidia Control Panel. This will open a new window which will allow you to tweak your graphic’s settings. Find the menu option labeled “Configure SLI, Surround, Physx”.


Select “Maximize 3D performance” and click Apply.
The screen will flash several times as the SLI configuration is enabled. You will be asked if you want to keep these settings.
If the option is not there, your system is most likely not recognizing one or more of your cards. Open the Device Manager in the Control Panel and check that all of your drives are visible under the Display Adapters section. If your cards are not showing up, check that they are connected properly, and that the drivers have been installed for all of them.

, Click the Manage 3D Settings link in the left menu. Under Global Settings, scroll down until you find the “SLI performance mode” entry. Change the settings from “Single GPU” to “Alternate Frame Rendering 2”. This will turn on SLI mode for all of your programs.


You can make adjustments to individual games by clicking the Program Settings tab and then selecting “SLI performance mode”.

, This will vary depending on the game you are running, so you will need to look up the specific instructions for the game you want to test. Frames per second is a baseline test for computing power, and can show you have well everything is being rendered. Most gaming enthusiasts shoot for a solid 60 frames per second with high settings.

, In the NVidia Control Panel, open the “3D Settings” menu. Enable the “Show SLI Visual Indicators” option. This will create a bar on the left side of your screen.Run your game. Once you have a game running, you will see the bar change. A taller bar means that SLI scaling is increasing, meaning that your SLI cards are working well and improving your visuals. If the bar is not very tall, then the SLI configuration is not affecting the display as much.

, My pole was wooden, so I could sand it down a bit when the fit got too tight at the base of the chair. (If you use a metal pole, it could go either inside or outside the stem of the chair base.) If it's too loose, find the centre of a roll of kitchen paper towels, cut a slit down the length of it, and use it to pad around the pole.

Find out if your computer’s graphics card can be upgraded.,
Learn the terminology associated with graphics cards.,
Consider how you use your card.,
Compare card specifications.,
Check the requirements of the software you want to run.,
Choose a card that best fits your price range.,
Get a cooling system (if necessary).",How to Choose a Graphics Card," Check your computer manufacturer’s documentation or open your computer to check the interface of the graphics card (the type of slot it uses to connect to the motherboard) and the capacity of your computer’s power supply.


Graphics cards can vary in physical size, meaning you should measure the space in your case and compare the area with any graphics cards you're considering.
Graphics cards will list their power requirements in their detailed specifications. Compare this with the capacity of your power supply. This information may be displayed on a sticker on the actual unit, but you may need to check the computer’s documentation instead.
Many laptop computers have integrated video cards, which are soldered to the computer's motherboard and cannot be replaced. Mac laptops in particular are notorious for their difficulty to upgrade.;
, Each aspect of a graphics card can help determine how it will perform and whether or not it fits your needs.


GPU (Graphics Processing Unit): This is the processor on your graphics card that manipulates the memory to create images on your screen. They handle graphical processing more efficiently than a computer’s regular CPU.
Core clock: This is the a measurement of the speed of the GPU. Higher clock speeds means faster processing.
Video RAM (Random Access Memory): VRAM is memory that is used for storing image data. Higher VRAM impacts framerate less than the clock speed, but does help with rendering at higher resolutions.Memory bandwidth: The memory bandwidth is a measurement of the speed of the video RAM. This helps determine how quickly objects can be rendered and can greatly impact performance.
Interface: This is the type of connection used by the graphics card to connect to the motherboard. Most modern graphics cards will use the PCI Express 3.0 interface.
Power Requirement: This is the amount of power required by your computer’s power supply, measured in watts.

, Video-intensive activities, such as graphic design, HD video, and gaming will benefit the most from an upgrade to the graphics card. A card upgrade is probably not necessary if you primarily use your computer for non-intensive activities like email, web surfing, or streaming music. A faster clock speed is necessary for fast, on-the-fly processing used in gaming. For something like graphic design/3D rendering, a larger bank of memory for rendering lots of textures will be more useful.

, Depending on your intended use, you may want to consider different strengths and weaknesses for different cards.


For gaming, you should focus more on bandwidth (the speed with which data is read and stored) than RAM. Bandwidth is typically measured in megahertz or gigahertz (MHz, GHz) while RAM is measured in Gigabytes (GB)., Most software, especially games, will post the minimum and recommended hardware requirements for running smoothly. This can be a good guideline for what kind of card to buy if you primarily want to upgrade to run that particular software.

, If you have the extra money, you may want to get a card that exceeds your needs to be able to run more intensive software in the future.


Hardware and software evolve quickly. A very cheap card may become obsolete very fast, while a top-of-the-line card may drop in price by the time that level of processing power is necessary to run software.
All but especially active gamers or designers should be able to find a very good graphics card for less than $400 USD. High-end graphics cards can reach in the thousands of USD. For the majority of people, spending this much is not necessary.

, High-end graphics cards often create heating issues due to their power usage. Most graphics cards will come with a fan or other heatsink, but you may have to purchase extra if your computer has poor ventilation.


Extra cooling will also draw from your power supply. If you’re already pushing the limits with the card, then you may want to consider upgrading the power supply as well.

Mark the case door for drilling.,
Drill the holes for the case fan.,
Attach and connect the case fan.",How to Connect Case Fans2," When there is no room left on the vented back panel of the computer case, a fan can be attached to the side-panel door of the tower. Mark and drill a series of holes near the rear of the side-panel door to attach and vent the supplemental case fan. Measure the distance between the screw holes located on each corner of the case fan. Use a marker, crayon or a grease pen to mark the location where the holes will need to be drilled on the side-panel door.


Use a straight edge ruler to draw 2 straight lines running diagonally between the marks for the screw holes, forming an ""X"" on the side-panel door. Using a straight-edge ruler, draw a straight line vertically through the center of the ""X,"" and another line horizontally through the ""X.""

, Use a 3/16 inch (4.76 mm) drill bit to drill holes through the first set of marks made to match the screw holes in each corner of the case fan being installed. Now drill holes, evenly spaced, along each of the diagonal, vertical and horizontal lines. The venting and screw holes have been drilled.

, Hold the new case fan against the inside of the side-panel door so that it lines up with each of the 4 screw holes. Insert a screw through each corner of the case fan. Locate an available 4-plug power connector coming from the power supply, plug the fan in and replace the side-panel door. The supplemental case fan has been installed.

Find a convenient access to the cable along its route which is also a possible branch point where you can run cables to other rooms.,
Get the things you'll need, listed below.

,
When you have all the cables together, with the cable cutter, cut about 1"" off the end of the cable although it has been cut already.,
With the cable stripper, pinch the back of it to open the 'jaws' and have it bite the cable about ½"" from its end.,
If this has been successful, two blades in the tool cut precisely into the cable at the right depth to slice the insulation over the wire, but not the functional strands.

,
Now grip the end of the cable after the cut and pull away the rings twisting slightly.,
Fold the small wire braid down over the outside part of the cable.

,
Now either fit the crimp-on or screw-on connector over the cable, keep going until the white plastic inner cylinder (known as a dielectric or dielectric insulator), meets flush with the interior of the connector.,
If you have the kind with a separate ring, make sure the ring is slipped over the cable before the connector goes on.

,
Depending on the crimp tool you have, now close it on the narrow neck of the connector and give it a squeeze.,
When you have completed all your ends including the original cable, it's time to connect them to the splitter.

,
If you know which direction the original cable runs label the cable in and out on either side of the cut and each room accordingly.,
When this is all done we can now connect each cable box available in their right rooms and power each device back on.",How to Install a 4 Way Splitter for Cable TV," If the construction of the house is of studded frame under sheetrock, you may first want to take a look at one of the cable path articles to get your cable to the full lengths where you need them.;
,, This clean cut perpendicular to its length ensures a clean finish. It's best to prepare the new cables for their full length before removing the original cable from service, so cut the existing cable last.

, Slowly rotate the tool right around 360° and release the jaws.

,, The cut will leave the end stepped down at two thicknesses.

,, The twist type just twists, the crimp type must be set in place before it is crimped.

,, If using a commercial grade crimp tool, it may have special instructions for use to be followed.

,, The splitter will have one connector labeled 'IN' and the other four as 'OUT', screw on the cable that brings your cable service in to the 'IN' to hand tight and all other cables to each of the connections labeled 'OUT'.

, If any one does not get a signal double check each connector, sometimes the small wires of the outer braid get tangled onto the center pin. These can be pulled clear to avoid trouble. See? you can do this yourself, cables for satellite installations are done somewhat differently, so that is for another article.

,
Trim the untwisted wires to a suitable length by holding the RJ-45 connector next to the wires.,
Insert the wires into the RJ-45 connector, making sure that they stay aligned and each color goes into its appropriate channel.,
Use the crimping tool to crimp the RJ-45 connector to the cable by pressing the jacket and cable into the connector so that the wedge at the bottom of the connector is pressed into the jacket.,
Follow the instructions above to crimp an RJ-45 connector to the opposite end of the cable.

,
Use a cable tester to assure that your cable is working properly when both ends are crimped.

",How to Crimp Rj45," Most ethernet cable is sold on spools of varying lengths, so you might have to measure and cut the amount you need when you get home.;
, Run the knife around the cable, and the jacket should slide off easily. There will be 4 pairs of twisted wires exposed, each of them a different color or color combination.


Orange-white striped and solid orange






Green-white striped and solid green






Blue-white striped and solid blue






Brown-white striped and solid brown







,,, Grasp a wire beneath a bend with 1 pair of tweezers, and use the other pair to gently straighten the bend. The straighter your wires, the easier your job will be.

,, The insulation on the cable should be just inside the bottom of the RJ-45 connector. The wires should be trimmed so that they line up evenly with the top of the RJ-45 connector.


Trim the wires in small increments, checking frequently to ensure a correct fit. It's better to cut the untwisted wires a few times than have to go back and start all over again because you trimmed off too much.







, Make sure that each wire goes all the way to the top of the RJ-45 connector. If you don't make these checks, you will find that your newly crimped RJ-45 connector is useless.

, Recrimp the cable once more to ensure proper connection.

Cut off the end of the coax. Use small, sharp wire cutters. Create a squared off surface, rather than a beveled surface.
Mold the end of the coax using your fingers. The cylindrical cable will be distorted by the pressure of making the square cut. Mold the end of the cable back into a cylinder.;
, These tools are available at hardware and electrical stores. Make sure that the end of the coax is flush against the wall or guide on the stripping tool. This will ensure proper strip length.

, Smoothly spin the tool around the coax 4 or 5 times, or until you no longer hear the sound of metal being scored. Keep the rotation in 1 place on the cable. Do not apply any force that would pull on the cable insulation coating.

, The tool will have made 2 cuts. Use your fingers to gently pull off the material nearest the end of the cable. This will expose the bare center conductor. Use your fingers to gently pull off the outer insulation that has been cut free. This will expose a layer of foil.

, This will expose a layer of metal mesh.

, Do not tear the layer of foil that is under the metal mesh. The foil must be left in place around the inner insulation. Bend the mesh all the way back so that it is molded over the end of the outer insulation.

, F connectors are available at hardware and electrical stores. Make sure that the white inner insulation can be seen pressing against the front flange of the connector. If you can't see the insulation, jiggle and continue to push the coax and the connector together. Use straight pressure only. Do not twist the coax in the body of the connector.

, Place the F connector into a coax crimping tool. Coax crimping tools are available at hardware and electrical stores. Fully squeeze the tool handle and release. Remove the finished crimp connection from the tool.

Test your cable if desired.",How to Crimp Cat 5," If you only need a few lengths of cord to wire a home network or other small network, consider buying cables in finished lengths from a computer supply store. If your needs are larger, come up with a rough estimate of the total length of cable you need.;
, You will need to buy 3 things: a length of Cat-5 cable, as many RJ-45 heads as you need, and a wire crimping tool. Cat-5 cable is best purchased from small computer supply stores; larger chain stores are less likely to carry bulk spools of cable. The plastic ends of the cables are called RJ-45 heads, and can also be purchased from computer supply stores. Each cable needs 2 heads, so buy twice as many as the number of cables you want to make. When buying a Cat-5 crimping tool, look for a model that includes a wire snipping tool. To be conservative, buy more cable and heads than you think you need.

, Determine the length needed for your cable and use the wire cutting tool on the crimping tool to cut the cable to this length.

, Use the wire cutting tool to strip away about half an inch (12.5 mm) of the outer coating on each end of the cable. You will see 8 small colored wires twisted into 4 pairs. Carefully untwist each pair so that each of the 8 wires is separate. Now arrange the wires in the proper order. From left to right, put the wires in this order: green and white, green, orange and white, blue, blue and white, orange, brown and white, brown.








,, (see pic)

, Carefully insert the wires (all at once) into the plastic head, pushing them in as far as they will go. The exposed wires should line up with the 8 small metal contacts in the head.








, Place the plastic head into the appropriate slot in the crimping tool, being careful not to dislodge the 8 wires. With the head positioned properly, apply pressure to the crimper's handles to clamp the head down onto the wires. The metal contacts should now be touching each of the 8 wires. Repeat this process on the other end of the cable.








, If you have a cable testing tool, insert both ends of your finished cable into the tool to check for a signal. The cable should now be ready to use.

",How to Crimp (Electronics),";
, You need to take enough insulation off to expose the wire completely.


Some crimp tools have a built-in insulation stripper. You can place the coated wire into the stripping hole and pull gently. This should expose the wire for crimping.

, Most crimp tools have 2 different crimp sizes on the tool.


The bigger crimp is for the insulation channel. The smaller crimp is for the stripped wire.

If you have a receiver with enough HDMI input ports, and your TV has at least one HDMI input, you should be able to connect all of your devices to get the best possible quality from your home theater.


Most new receivers will have multiple HDMI inputs that allow you to connect all of your HDMI-capable devices, as well as an HDMI output for connecting to your TV.
You can buy an HDMI splitter for a one-port receiver.

, Check that your TV supports HDMI 1.4 ARC (Audio Return Channel). This allows the TV to send audio back to the receiver, which routes your TV sound through your home theater speakers. Most TVs made after 2009 support HDMI 1.4 and newer.


If your TV does not support HDMI 1.4, you will need to use a separate audio cable to connect the TV to the receiver (e.g., digital optical).
If you are watching TV through a cable box via your receiver, you don't need to worry about ARC since the sound is coming from the cable box into the receiver., These could include DVD/Blu-ray players, game consoles, and more. If you have limited HDMI inputs, use HDMI cables for the most recent devices first, as they will benefit the most.


For example, if your receiver only has two HDMI inputs and you have a Roku, a PlayStation 4, and a DVD changer, plug the Roku and the PS4 in with HDMI, and use a component connection for the DVD player. The Roku and PS4 will benefit much more from the HDMI connections.
HDMI plugs only go in one way, so don't force any connections.

, Plug one end of an HDMI cable into the receiver's HDMI slot, then plug the other end into the TV. This allows the image from all the devices connected to your receiver appear on your TV.

, Since your devices are now routed through the receiver, the TV can be set to the HDMI input that you plugged in from the receiver, allowing you to switch between inputs using your receiver remote.


Since everything has been connected via HDMI, all the sound from your devices should go through your receiver's speaker setup.
Most devices should configure automatically when they detect the HDMI connection, though you may need to tweak some settings for certain devices.

, If you aren't setting up a home theater system, you can still plug your HDMI devices directly into your TV and then control the inputs using your TV remote. Most modern TVs have at least two HDMI inputs.


If you have more HDMI-capable devices than you do input ports on your TV, you can purchase an HDMI switch that will expand the number of available HDMI ports.

, HDMI-CEC allows you to use your TV remote to control your other HDMI devices. To enable HDMI-CEC, you'll have to access each device's settings menu.

, For this scenario, you'll be making a straight-through cable, which has both ends of the cable with the same alignment of wires, so it's easy enough to do. Since this is your first cable, we'll consult the cheat sheet to know what order we're aligning in!








, Once you've untwisted the wires, you'll have a superfluous amount of copper wiring left; we don't need this much, but it's good to have it in the previous step to help in aligning the colors properly. Use the wire-cutting scissors to cut these off.








, Be careful not to bend the wires while pushing them in or you run the risk of creating a bad cable. You also don't want too little or too much wire left in the head; there's no definite length necessary, but it's pretty obvious to tell if there's too much cable or not enough. A short length of the jacket should be up the RJ45 head; use this knowledge as a reference.








, (Consult your cheat sheet if needed!)

, If you don't crimp the cable all the way, the head may come off.








,, If you're repairing one end, this won't apply to you, so move on.

, Turn it on and listen for the beep. If it beeps once, you successfully made an Ethernet cable; if it beeps twice, some part of the cable is messed up and needs repairing. Depending on the error, the cable may or may not still be usable.

RG stands for “Radio Guide.” The numbers of the different versions of RG cable refer to the diameter (59 meaning .059, and 6 meaning .06, etc) and inner characteristics of the cable, containing the amount of shielding or the cable’s reduction, which refers to how much signal loss there is per length of cable. You may also see the term RF used with these coaxial cables, which stands for “Radio Frequency.”
Most non-industrial coaxial cable is now identified as RG-6, while the previous thinner lower-quality standard of RG-59 is still used in some applications or older homes. Business installers may use a thicker RG cable, such as RG-11(which is only used if the distance from the source hit to your point of termination at the residence is greater than 200 feet).
RG coax cables used in residence for ordinary reasons should be 75 ohm (RG-6 or RG-59).


You must be aware that all cables (and their connectors) come in a variety of qualities.

, Most connectors for home video installations are complete with F-Style connectors. But, it is possible your system uses N-type connectors. You must be aware that there are many types of F-type RG-6 cable available in the market, primarily screw-on or crimp-style connectors.


Screw-on connectors are easy to use, but they are less secure and can leave a small air pocket. Some people believe this may influence your signal quality.
Crimp-style connectors have two parts: a ring (or crimp) or a terminator. They are normally more difficult to install, but can achieve the greatest lengths and best connections when used properly.

, Trim the outer cover of cable (usually black rubber) back 1/2"". You must be very careful not to cut into the metal braiding directly under the outer housing. The braiding maybe both “loose” cable and a foil-like metal present in shielded cable.

, Check to ensure none of the braided cable gets covered around or touches the copper center conductor. Be completely sure not to scratch or cut the center conductor. Any damage to this conductor can severely impact on your signal.

,,, The thread will cut into the outer housing and cover the shielding weave, making a tight fit of RG-6 coaxial cable with TV cabling."

Televisions have full-size HDMI ports, so one side of the HDMI cable must be equipped with a full-size plug.
Your input device (computer, game system, etc.) may have a full-size, mini, or micro HDMI port, however. Check the port size of your input device and make sure that the other end of the HDMI cable has a plug that fits.
Make sure that the HDMI cable is long enough, too. The length of the cable should be a little longer than the distance between your input device and television.;
, Plug the appropriate end of the HDMI cable into the HDMI port located on your input device.


Note that the input device should already be on and ready to play.
You should only be able to insert the HDMI plug into the port in one direction. Never force the cable plug into the port since doing so could damage both the cord and the device.

, Insert the open full-size plug into one of the HDMI ports located on the side or back of your television.


Note that the TV should already be turned on.
If your TV has more than one HDMI port, pay attention to the port you use. For instance, the port might be labeled as ""HDMI-1"" or ""HDMI-2.""

, Use the buttons on your TV or the remote control to switch your television to the appropriate TV input source.


You'll usually need to press the ""Input"" or ""Source"" button to switch input sources. Scroll through the options until you reach the appropriate HDMI port (HDMI-1, HDMI-2, etc.).

DVI connections have the best conversion capabilities, so if your input device has a DVI port, select a DVI-to-HDMI adapter.
If your input device does not have a DVI port, either, look for USB ports or standard VGA ports. Adapters are available for either option.Note that Mac computers may also have a mini-display/Thunderbolt port. Adapters that can connect an HDMI cable to this port are the best option for Mac computers with an HDMI port.

, The HDMI cable you use must be able to connect to the HDMI ports in both your TV and your chosen adapter.


Most televisions have full-size HDMI ports, so at least one end of the cable must be equipped with a full-size plug. Many adapters also have full-size HDMI ports, but some may have mini or micro ports. Make sure that the second end of your HDMI cable matches the adapter port size.
The HDMI cable must also be long enough to reach from your input device to your television. It's best to choose a cord that is slightly longer than necessary to minimize the strain on the cord and both devices.

, Insert the full-size plug into the HDMI port on the back or side of your TV. Connect the other end of the HDMI cable into the HDMI port on your adapter.


Both the TV and input device should already be turned on before you begin plugging everything together.
Do not force the plug into the port. It should only fit one way, and if it doesn't fit at all, you may have the wrong type of cable.

, Connect the adapter plug into the appropriate port on your input device.


When using a DVI, USB, or Thunderbolt adapter, you only need to plug the adapter into one port.
If using an adapter for VGA ports, you will likely need to match the color of each adapter plug to the corresponding audio and video ports on your computer.

, In some cases, the adapter may only direct video from your input device to your TV. In these cases, you will need to use a separate cable to stream audio to your TV.This is fairly uncommon, but you might run into this issue if you are using a DVI-to-HDMI adapter or an older USB-to-HDMI adapter.
If both your input device and TV have the appropriate ports, you might be able to directly connect the two devices using a separate stereo cable.
Alternatively, you can use an audio cable to redirect audio from your input device to a separate nearby set of speakers previously hooked up to your TV.

, Using the buttons on your TV or TV remote control, switch your television input source to the appropriate HDMI port.


Typically, you'll need to use a button labeled ""Input"" or ""Source.""
Work your way through the different input options until you find the HDMI port currently in use. The HDMI source should be labeled in the same way as the HDMI port (HDMI-1, HDMI-2, and so on).

, Typically, the input device will automatically configure its video and audio settings upon detecting the connection to your TV. If your TV is blank, though, you may need to configure your input device manually.


If using a PC:

Go into your Control Panel and choose Adjust screen resolution. Click on the icon for the second monitor and select the Extend the desktop onto this monitor setting. Apply the change to send video to the TV.

By installing a torrent client, you'll be able to download files that other users are sharing. One of the most popular torrent clients is qBittorrent. You can download it for free from qbittorrent.org.


Follow the prompts to install the client. If you are installing qBittorrent, you shouldn't be prompted to install additional adware. If you're installing a different client, such as uTorrent, read each screen carefully. You don't want to install additional software.;
, A torrent tracker acts as a search engine for torrents. You can use it to find files that users are sharing with each other. You can usually find most new shows, as well as popular older shows. Search for ""anime torrents"" using your favorite search engine to find some. Popular trackers that host anime torrents include:AnimeTorrents
KickassTorrents
BakaBT
Haruichan
NyaaTorrents

, There are a few different ways that you can search for things, depending on what you are looking to download:


To search for a specific episode, add the episode number to the end of the title. Most anime shows use a continual numbering system for shows. Season numbers aren't usually included
Add the word ""complete"" to the end of the title to look for an entire series. This should return torrents that contain all of the episodes released. These can be very big torrents, especially for long shows. It may be broken up into individual volumes.

, Most anime torrents will have Japanese audio with English subtitles included. Older files may have subtitles hardcoded onto the video. You may be able to find an English-dubbed version as well, depending on the show. The torrent title and details will let you know what languages are included.

, Try to pick a torrent that has a lot of seeders. They are usually indicated on the search results in the ""S"" column. Seeders are users who have the complete file and are sharing it for others. More seeders will lead to a faster download.

, Be careful when clicking this link. Many torrent sites will try to trick you into clicking a fake link that leads to an advertisement.


It is illegal to download anime that you have not purchased. You could face legal action or penalties from your ISP if caught. To learn how to minimize your risk, see How to Be Online Anonymously.

, Most torrent clients will automatically open when you download the torrent file. If your client doesn't open, load the torrent file into the client manually.

, Your torrent client will begin connecting to other people who are sharing it. Your download speed will be slow at first, but start to pick up as you connect to more seeders. You can monitor the torrent's progress in the main window.


See How to Download Torrents for more details.

, The easiest way to play any video file and use subtitles is to install VLC Player. This is a free, open source video player that can play virtually any format. This is important because most anime is released in MKV format. MKV is not compatible with Windows Media Player or Quicktime.You can download VLC for free from videolan.org/ for any operating system. This includes Android and iOS.

, When you install VLC Player, it should take over duties for opening most video files. If the video tries to launch in your default video player, right-click it and select ""Open With VLC Player"".


If the video is choppy, your computer's hardware may not be up to the task of playing HD video. Try closing any other programs that are running to see if playback improves.

, If the video came with subtitles, you can select them from the ""Subtitles"" menu in VLC after loading the video. Select ""Sub Track"" and then choose the language you want to load. If you don't see any options here, you may have to download a separate subtitle file. You can usually find a link to these in the details section of the torrent's page on the tracker. Most anime torrents come with the subtitle files included in the video's MKV file.

, If the anime video has dual-audio, such as the original Japanese track and an English dub, you can switch between them in the ""Audio"" menu. Select ""Audio Track"" and then choose the language you want to listen to.

There are many ways to hide ones tracks on the information superhighway.,
After that, all the data that the user receives or transmits is encrypted.

,
All operations involving the torrent network will take place by using an IP address of a server that is located at the other end of the world.",How to Download Anonymously," The main way people put a face on a computer is with the computers IP address. That number can easily be turned into a real address with minimal effort. Therefore almost all anonymous services deal solely with IP addresses. IP anti-detection can be divided into one of two categories. Namely:


Software Based:

Proxy: A proxy in simple terms is another computer out there somewhere that bounces your connection to where you want it to go. You can download add-ons for Firefox so these proxy ""Addresses"" can be typed in.
List Blocking: List are compiled of various Computer addresses that people wish to block from their connection. Using this service one can, to some degree block the government, RIAA, Spyware sites and even Ads. A popular free list blocking tool is called peer guardian.
Bounce link: Some hosting sites allow you to download a link that they themselves have in stock that users have uploaded. After a disclaimer they take no responsibility for links that users upload, some even delete IP address logs; or


Hardware Based: By adding or removing certain parts from a computer a person can reach a level of high anonymity.

NIC-USB: By removing your internet card you achieve perfect anonymity, they can't come through the power cord right? However, if you want to stay online it may be better to invest in some hardware that will take you there. Get yourself a high volume data recovery drive, In short a huge USB flash drive. Install an operating system and all you have to do to use a random computers BIOS setup to boot the computer up from USB. This comes in handy at pizza places with high speed, or even some coffee shops. However, you will then have to stay anonymous in real life and will eventually have to learn advanced SSH protocols.
Differential Porting: Two computers can be hitched together using parallel or serial cables as well, given that proper hardware and software conditions are met. Using this method several computers can be hitched together with mixed proxies and ports to confuse any would be down peeper.
Airsnorting: With a wireless laptop one can sit outside a coffee shop. By using a nameless Linux application one can find the invisible encryption keys that flow through the air during wireless transmissions thus giving you the golden ticket to their connection. This combined with SSH protocol will put you online almost anywhere.
SSH protocol: With a small PirateRay application that uses SSH secure tunnel to one of the PirateRay servers. A user can select either a specific server or set the settings to enable the random selection of the server whenever the application starts.

Try to understand the site's purpose and customs and show your interest in creating ""harmony"" in the contribution.
If you are contributing a large amount of text, organize it.
Make your contribution easy to read. Avoid unnecessary jargon. Add images for explanation, or, depending on the overall style and purpose of the wiki, at least here and there for decoration and page appeal.;
, When people see blank pages (or even in some cases, partially blank, or empty), they disregard the wiki as not functioning or badly written, and thus may not edit as they consider it a waste of time and energy. Before you launch it, add some seed content for people to build on. The size of this seed content could be seen as the critical mass required for people to take the wiki seriously and build upon it.

, Wikis entail people investing time in improving a resource without any monetary benefit to themselves thus it is essential to understand the values that drive people to edit wikis and to align your wiki to these values. Remember that you are contributing to universal knowledge, and the growth of the human mind and communication - every small step is important. In a business setting, remember good wiki contributions in evaluating employees.

, In a volunteer setting, set up a system for regularly welcoming and thanking and formally recognizing contributors.

, Editors often get turned away by the effort required to edit. Make editing as easy as possible. This can be done by, as before mentioned, making contributions well-written to begin with, conspicuously directing users to an explanation of the markup language, and avoiding overly complex markup.

, Wikis thrive on people giving something to the community without getting anything monetary back. Thus excessive ads may distance people from considering the community their own. People may understand the need for some ads to keep a wiki organization afloat but overdoing it may alienate editors.


A wiki for an organization's internal use or of interest to a limited community would generate little traffic, and generally wouldn't need ads.
Note that you might not be able to disable ads, and will in this case, have nothing to do about it but quit if the policy seems abusive.

, Every subject has its own structure. You can structure a wiki contribution to the needs of your field, but don't make the formatting so complicated that someone else wanting to contribute can't figure out how.

, Appreciate new users and watch them improve over time. You may have to clean up their work a little more at first, and gently coach them out of serious annoyances, but patience builds WikiLove."

Feel free to edit the main page and put whatever you want there, if you want to change its display.

, A wiki without these sorts of guidelines might be misused, and editors could wonder what to do.


Try creating some standards on the noteworthiness of articles, including how they should be formatted, and how research should be done. You might also want to include standards on weaving the web of links.

, The help pages are the pages that other editors and just regular visitors look at, if they are stuck or have a question.

Feel free to edit the whole message if you want to.
Be careful. Editing an interface message will change the user interface for all users. That being said, don't do things like changing the ""Edit"" button to ""Blah,"" because other editors probably won't know how that button functions.

, A wiki needs content so that other users have something to edit when they become a part of the community.


Create the articles. Be sure to follow the article noteworthiness standards yourself when doing this, or you'll be breaking your own rule.

You will need to register an email, but you aren't required to use your real name. Creating account will translate to creating a profile. An editing profile gains more credit on a wiki rather than as an anonymous writer. Registered users are also entitled to more editing privileges and input into relevant discussion over policies and editing features. This means only people with a Wikia profile can request rights to start a new wiki.;
, Wikia currently hosts over 4300 communities, and before requesting a wiki it is necessary to check whether it meets the policy of having a wide enough appeal to attract a large potential audience. If your proposal is too narrow you will be asked to broaden it. You're also recommended to find out if your idea is already covered by an existing Wikia or become part of a Wikimedia project.

, Decide what the aims of your wiki will be. Draft a mission statement. You will need to decide a title and name for the wiki. For a peer review, a wise step to take is to have your idea evaluated by others. This means discussing the plans for your wiki on the proposed wikis forum, or writing several pages on the Scratchpad Wiki to give a general overview. From there, you could start by creating a ""Mini-Wiki"" at the Scratchpad Wiki. Later, this can be transferred to a full Wikia.

, You can enter the Requests Wikia from the navigation toolbar on Central Wikia ""Request a Wikia"". Wikia cannot set up a wiki without assurance that the requester is motivated, organized and willing to take on the role as the founder of a wiki. Filling out a requests form is necessary to present your plan to Wikia at a formal approach. There are four terms you must accept before the request form.


Is your wiki unique?
Will your wiki attract lots of contributors?
Are you happy for everyone to edit this wiki, and for it to be under a free content license?
Do you agree to Wiki's terms of use?

,


Name for the wiki; what the wiki will be named as a URL, e.g. <insert wikia name here>.wikia.com.
Title for the wiki; the general name of the wiki on the browser toolbar, e.g. books.wikia.com might be labeled ""Books Wiki"".
Default language for the wiki; and language will be set as a default for the wiki.
Description of the wiki; about the wiki and what sort of articles to be included.

Community; who will edit this wiki, how will you promote this wiki so that others will join in?

, Include some content on who you are, so other people will learn more about you (this step is optional).

,, The main page of the wiki should describe what it is about, what its mission statement is, etc.

, Look for freely licensed photos and articles to add to your wiki so that your editors have content to edit. Wikimedia Commons, Morgue File, Flickr and Everystockphoto are good sources for freely licensed images.

, Make your new theme creative by adding color, customizing the wordmark, etc.

, Effectively attract and maintain an editing population. Giving that the topic is relevant to a high number of potential editors and ample promotion has been staged, expect several helping hands.


Try promoting your wiki by emailing friends and colleagues about it, advertising it on social networking sites, etc.

Many trackpads are multi-touch - using multiple fingers will produce different user interface actions than using just one. Experiment with your laptop by dragging one, two or three fingers across it and trying different 'gestures' or movements with your fingers.
Lenovo laptops may use a small, red joystick-like button called a ""trackpoint"" located in the middle of the keyboard between the 'G' and 'H' keys. Use it just like a very sensitive joystick for just your finger.
Some older laptops may have a trackball. Rolling the ball on a trackball will cause the mouse pointer to move around.
