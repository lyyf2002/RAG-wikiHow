Yes, experimenting is a good idea but having a solid plan up front will prevent a lot of problems when you decide to get it setup.;
, Having a forum software (or backbone) is the key essential to a forum. Without it, all you will have is a plan, and a hosting account. There are many different types of software out there written in different coding languages. Make sure you understand what your host supports and what your software will require. MySQL and PHP are the most common requirements. Some free choices, are SMF and PHPBB. A paid choice is vBulletin.

, Search around the Internet to find a good solid host. Of course paid hosts are better but using a free host in the beginning will allow you to see what you are getting into.

, When you apply for a host you will receive your hosting accounts information which will include (MySQL link, username, and password; FTP link, username, and password; account username, and password; and a link to your cPanel). When you are ready to upload, you will need a FTP program (FileZilla and SmartFTP are good examples). Open the FTP program and drag and drop into the public HTML folder. The folders name will vary so ask your host what folder to upload to unless you know what folder it is. To customize the URL, while in the FTP program (before you upload everything) create a forum inside the public HTML folder and call it forum, or forums, pretty much anything you want to call it.

, Log into your CPanel (using your account name and password) go to the section named databases or MySQL databases. Make a database. Make it with a short name (i.e. forumdb). Your hosting account name will usually come in front of the database name (i.e. b18_999999_forumdb). You will need this in the step below.

, Visit the URL of the forum and an install prompt will be present (if everything went as planned. If it is not present, troubleshoot and if all else fails, contact your forum software company). When you begin the installation, you will need your MySQL database information. Enter your MySQL database information and proceed to the next step. Depending on your forum software, the steps may differ (it will usually guide you through the process). Usually 1-2 steps later you will be asked to make an admin account (YOUR ACCOUNT). Give it a name (custom) and a password (custom) as well as an e-mail. When this is done, it may either begin to install all the MySQL tables or your installation may be finished. Like it says above, it differs from software to software. When you are done, be sure to delete the install.php file (via FTP). The installation may delete it automatically. If you forget to delete it, it poses a risk to your forum security.

, In this step, you can make your own theme (if you have knowledge in XML, CSS, and Graphics) or you can download a free or paid theme. When you obtain a skin (as they are called) you may have to upload it via FTP or via your forums Admin CP. Like the step above, it differs from software to software.

, At this time, begin the building process. This will require the addition of categories and individual Forums and Sub-Forums. categories come first, then forums, then sub-forums. It is up to you to decide the names of categories and forums as well as their content.

, Be it global forum rules, or rules specifically designed for a certain section, make the rules so that the forum can be used effectively and to minimize spam (a major culprit on forums).

, When starting off, one to two admins (including yourself) will be all that you need for administrators. Look for people who are interested in a Global/Super Moderator position and if they don't want that much responsibility, offer them a Moderator position. It is recommended that these people are trustworthy.

, Make forum member groups so that you can organize your members. The most common are Administrator, Global/Super Moderator, Moderator, Member, and Banned. Most software allow unlimited member-groups but too many can make organization confusing, tedious, and time consuming.

, You should specify which mods you would like to have (chatbox, Captcha system, Top Stats, etc.). Like before, installation of these mods will differ.

, Most new forums make an affiliate icon, a userbar, as well as a banner to help with advertising. Making these is fairly simple. Google for some tutorials.

, Yes, starting off you will be stressed and worried. Don't get mad or upset if your forum is inactive after the first month, projects like this take time to get setup as well as to form a member base.

Crowdsource content moderation.,
Use post-moderation.,
Create a point system.,
Offer rewards.,
Serve penalties.",How to Get Your Online Community Involved in Content Moderation," Crowdsourcing is one way of involving users in your moderating efforts. By making content moderation not just a responsibility but a paid duty, community members could be more vigilant in spotting objectionable submissions. You might conduct an online recruitment for user-moderators who can be assigned to do the following minor tasks:

Reviewing violations reported by other users
Flagging spammers
Filtering profanity
Approving comments on posts
Screening entries for photo or video contests.;
, With post-moderation, users can report posts of fellow site members that violate submission guidelines. Each post could come with a list of options prompting viewers to flag inappropriateness, submit feedback, or report defects in site functionality. Post-moderation can also double as an audience engagement tool. In this type of moderation, users can rate posts to feature best submissions, burying duplicates, spam, and unremarkable content in the process., This is preferable if your site hosts a forum page with several sub-forums or threads. Aside from assigning points or credits to every forum post submitted by users, you may also offer higher credits to users who can report malicious content, such as spams or defamatory comments. The credit system can pave way for a ranking scheme that can motivate users to be active in identifying unwanted content., Of course, your community would be more motivated to actively report violations if they could reap rewards from the action. With the credit or point system in hand, you can reward top user-moderators with incentives such as these:

Forum badges
Site privileges
Forum points converted to tokens or shopping credits
Personalized rewards or gifts
Free memberships
First preview of new site features.

, Users would be mindful of their actions if they are aware of the consequences of violating community guidelines. Make your restrictions and sanctions viewable and easy to comprehend so that no member would have an excuse for making offenses. Let them know about penalty levels, and explain what kinds of content could be subjected to removal or what type of online activities can cause user suspension and permanent blocking."

Await the verdict.",How to Fight Cybersquatting," The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is responsible for coordinating domain names. Any deal done between a registrar (i.e., the entity that provides domain name registration services to the public) and a domain name holder includes an agreement to follow UDRP. Under UDRP, whenever there is a dispute between you (the trademark holder) and the domain name holder, certain procedures must be followed.The first thing you must do is draft a complaint that complies with the UDRP Rules. Under these rules, your complaint must contain the following information:The name and contact information of the respondent (i.e., the domain name holder)
The domain name that is at issue.
The registrar with whom the domain name is registered.
The trademark the complaint is based on.
A description of how you meet UDRP's three elements for a valid cybersquatting claim, which are (1) that the domain name registered by the respondent is identical or confusingly similar to your trademark, (2) that the respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the domain name, and (3) that the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.;
, To start the official dispute resolution process, your complaint must be filed with a provider approved by ICANN. You can find ICANN's complete list of approved providers on their website. Choose a provider and submit your complaint to them.


When you submit the complaint you will be required to pay a fixed filing fee. The filing fee will vary depending on the provider you choose and the manner in which you choose the complaint to be heard (i.e., by a single-member panel vs. a three-member panel)., When the provider receives your complaint, they will submit a verification request to the registrar. This request will require the registrar to lock the domain name, which prevents the respondent from making any changes to domain name information. The registrar will confirm the lock with the provider, at which point the provider will notify the respondent of the complaint.


The respondent will have 20 days to respond to the complaint. The response will respond to every allegation you made in your complaint and will include every reason why the respondent thinks they should retain rights to the domain name.

, You and the respondent will each have an opportunity to voice whether you want your dispute to be heard by a single-member panel or a three-member panel. If both parties choose a single-member panel, the provider will appoint a single panelist from their list. If you or the respondent choose to have a three-member panel decide the dispute, you will each have an opportunity to submit the names of three possible candidates. The provider will then choose the final panel but will try to include at least one panelist from each party's list., Once the panel has been chosen, the provider will forward your complaint and the respondent's response to the panel. Other evidence can be submitted to the panel only if the panel requests it. There will not be any in-person hearings unless the panel decides that one is necessary.

, Once the panel has reviewed all of the evidence, it will draft its decision, in writing, within 14 days of being appointed. The decision will explain the reasons for the panel's decision, when it was rendered, and who each panelist was. The panel will send its decision to the provider. The provider will forward the entire decision to you and the respondent within three days of receiving it.


The provider will also forward the decision to the applicable registrar and ICANN. After receiving the decision, the domain name registrar will have to implement the decision., ACPA is a federal law that allows you (the trademark owner) to sue a cybersquatter in federal court to obtain an order requiring the cybersquatter to transfer the domain name to you. In some instances, the cybersquatter may even have to pay damages.Because you will be filing a lawsuit in federal court, you should always hire a qualified lawyer to help you through the process. To hire a lawyer, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. After answering a few questions about your legal dispute you will be put in touch with a number of qualified lawyers in your area.


Once you have the names of a few qualified candidates, call them and ask for an initial consultation. During these meetings you will be able to ask the candidates questions about your case and about their legal practices. Make sure the lawyer has a good grasp of your case and feels comfortable with the subject matter (i.e., internet law, cybersquatting, and intellectual property law). Do not forget to ask how the lawyer charges for his or her services.
After you conduct each initial consultation, hire the lawyer you feel most comfortable with.

, Once you hire a lawyer, sit down with him or her to discuss your lawsuit. In order to bring a successful case under ACPA, you will have to prove in court that (1) the domain name holder had a bad faith intent to profit from your trademark, (2) your trademark was distinctive when the domain name was registered, (3) the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to your trademark, and (4) your trademark qualifies for federal protection.If you successfully sue under ACPA, your remedy will usually be restricted to the transfer of the domain name to you., If you think you can meet every element set forth under ACPA, you will have to figure out who to sue. Ideally you will find the domain name holder and sue them where a court can find that in personam jurisdiction exists (i.e., jurisdiction over the person). However, ACPA has contemplated the fact you may not be able to find the domain name holder and assert normal in personam jurisdiction. If you find yourself unable to track down the domain name holder, ACPA allows you to file an in rem (jurisdiction over the property) civil action against the domain name.


Under ACPA, you can bring an in rem civil action if the domain name holder or registrar is not subject to a court's jurisdiction, or you cannot find the domain name holder or registrar., Your ACPA lawsuit must be filed in federal court in a district that has jurisdiction over the defendant or the property in question. If you are asserting in personam jurisdiction against the domain name holder or registrar, you can file your case in the federal district where the defendant resides, maintains connections, or is served.If you are asserting in rem jurisdiction, you must file your case in the district where the domain name holder or registrar is located, or where you can establish control over the registration and use of the domain name., The complaint is a formal legal document that starts a lawsuit. It tells the court, as well as the defendant, what you are suing for and how you want the case resolved. Your complaint will need to include at least the following information:The case caption, which identifies the parties to the case and the court you are suing in.
Whether you want a jury trial.
A description of jurisdiction (i.e., whether the court has in personam or in rem jurisdiction and why that is).
The cause of action, which will explain that you are suing for cybersquatting under ACPA.
The remedy you want, which in this case will be a forfeiture of the domain name by the domain name holder and a transfer of ownership to you.

, A summons is a form that tells the defendant he or she is being sued and demands a response from them. This form is usually already filled out and all you have to do is fill in the defendant's name as well as the number of days the defendant has to respond. The time limit applying to your case can be found in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which you can download online from your court's website.While different types of cases will have different response times, they are usually around 30 days.

, Take your complaint and summons, as well as multiple copies of each, to the federal courthouse and file them with the clerk of courts. The clerk will check your documents and, if they are satisfactory, will ask you to pay the $400 filing fee. If you cannot afford the filing fee, you can submit a motion to proceed in forma pauperis, which asks the court to waive the fee.


If you pay the fee, your lawsuit will be stamped as ""filed"" and you will be given an official summons.
If you filed for a fee waiver, your lawsuit will not be stamped as ""filed"" until your motion is granted., Once your lawsuit has been filed, you will take a copy of the complaint, as well as the official summons, and give them to the defendant. Serving a copy of your lawsuit on the defendant gives him or her notice that they are being sued and allows them to respond. To serve the defendant, hire someone to give copies to the defendant in person or in the mail.


Once service is complete, the server will fill out a Return of Service form that you will file with the court., Once the defendant is served, he or she will have to respond within the time period set forth in the summons. The defendant will usually respond by filing an answer and serving it on you. The answer will respond to each of your allegations by admitting or denying them. In addition, the defendant may file cross-complaints or other motions to try and get the case dismissed.


Read the answer carefully as it will give you an idea of how the defendant is going to fight the case.
If the defendant fails to respond to your lawsuit, the court may enter a default judgment in your favor, which means you will get the relief you requested in your complaint., Discovery gives you and the defendant an opportunity to exchange information in order to get ready for trial. You will want information about who witnesses are, what relevant documents are out there, and what the defendant will say. To get the information you want, you will be able to use the following tools:Depositions, which are in-person interviews with witnesses and parties. The interviews are conducted under oath and answers can be used in court.
Interrogatories, which are written questions posed to witnesses and parties. The questions are answered under oath and can be used in court.
Document requests, which are formal requests asking the defendant to hand over relevant documents.
Requests for admissions, which ask the defendant to admit or deny the truth of certain facts. This helps minimize the issues that need to be handled at trial.

, As soon as discovery concludes, the defendant will probably file a motion for summary judgment. To be successful, the defendant will need to persuade the court that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the defendant is arguing that even if the court made every factual assumption in your favor, you would still lose.


You can defend against this motion by filing your own evidence and affidavits that persuade the court that factual disputes exist and that they should be handled during trial., If you make it past the summary judgment phase of litigation, you might want to consider settling your case. Going to trial can be expensive and time-consuming, often times costing your more than your case is ever worth. Therefore, even if you win at trial, you might end up losing money. To attempt a settlement, sit down with the defendant and discuss what you want out of your ACPA case (i.e., transfer the domain name to you). To foster a settlement, you may even tell the defendant you will pay a small fee for the domain name. If you cannot come to an agreement, you might try the following:


Mediation, which involves asking a neutral third party to get involved and help the settlement process The mediator will help find common ground but will never take sides or voice opinions.
Arbitration, which involves asking a judge-like third party to hear evidence and draft an opinion. The arbitrator will hear evidence presented by both parties and will then draft an opinion.

, If you cannot settle your case out of court, you will have to attend a final pretrial hearing in order to discuss the issues that need to be heard at trial. The judge will put together a trial road map and schedule in response to this meeting. Be sure you bring up every possible issue during this meeting. If you forget to raise an issue, it may not be scheduled and you will not be able to raise it at trial., If you invoked your right to a jury trial in your complaint, you will choose your jury during a process called ""voire dire."" During voire dire you will be able to ask questions of potential jurors in order to assess their ability to impartially hear and decide your case. If you do not think a possible juror can be impartial, you can ask the court to remove that juror. Once you have chosen your jury, they will be empaneled and your trial will begin.


If you waived your right to a jury trial, your case will be heard by the judge., Every trial starts with you, the plaintiff, making an opening statement. Your opening statement should be a short synopsis of the case and should conclude with you forcefully assuring the court that you will win. Do not introduce any evidence and do not make things confusing during your opening statement. Be brief and to the point.


The defendant will have an opportunity to make an opening statement after you. In some circumstances, the defendant may be able to wait until they present their case to make their statement.

, As the plaintiff, you will present your case first. Your case will consist of calling witnesses to the stand and introducing testimony and physical evidence through them. Evidence will only be admitted if it complies with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which can usually be found on the court's website.


When you are finished asking questions, the defendant will have an opportunity to cross-examine your witnesses. Prepare your witnesses for cross-examination by thinking of possible questions the defense might ask and coach your witnesses about those questions., When you rest and finish presenting your case, the defendant will have an opportunity to present their case. After the defendant questions each witness, you will have an opportunity to cross-examine them. During cross-examination you will try to discredit the witness by making them look biased and/or untruthful.


For example, if you deposed a witness who said she knew your trademark existed, but that same witness said she had no idea the trademark existed during trial, you will bring this up., When the defendant has rested, you will give a closing argument to end the trial. Your closing argument should be a recap of the case and all of the important evidence that falls in your favor. Reiterate that you have met the burdens of the law and that you should win. Remember, this is your last chance to talk with the court so you want to make it good.


When you are done giving your closing argument, the defendant will have a chance to make one as well.

, After the trial is completed, the fact-finder (i.e., the judge or jury) will take a moment to deliberate and consider the evidence they heard. When the fact-finder comes to a conclusion, they will announce their verdict in court.If you win, the domain name will be transferred to you. If you lose, the domain name will still in the defendant's possession.

Try to be friendly and nice.,
Ignore their efforts.,
Get help if they won't stop after the above.,
Try to be seen as noble and respectable in the community.,
If everything else fails, take a stand.",How to Escape a Flame War," Believe it or not, a lot of flame wars aren't started by the trolls themselves, but by people that fall in to their traps. Flamers set traps, waiting for someone to fall into it. This is usually how most flame wars start, and it's usually only because the person is desperate for attention.;
, On most sites where one can happen, a flame war can get you and the other guy banned. Try to get out of the war early, or show no hostility. If you're not hostile, chances are you won't get in trouble. They're likely going to call you a wimp or coward or something along those lines. Just ignore it. Remember at all times that they're just doing it for attention.

, Sometimes a flame war is inevitable and unavoidable, but that doesn't mean you can't end it. No matter how much it seems as if it's their fault or seems like it makes you weak, calmly and nicely apologize, and let it be. Don't provoke them further, it just shows you are gullible enough to stoop to their level and that you are no better than them.

, Whether you can or cannot end it, being non-hostile helps. It might even change them. If you end it and they pursue afterwards, it'll just make them look bad in the eyes of other and eventually others will take a stand.

, If you cannot stop them, ignore them. They can't do flame forever, and they'll eventually get tired of you not replying to their pleas for attention. If you can, try to put them on an ignore list if the place has one.

, Some people are such jerks, that even after you've done everything above, they'll still try to come after you. They aren't going to rest because they want to win and be seen as someone with power so they can command everyone else around. Even if you ignore them, some people are hardheaded to the point no matter what you try they will keep finding ways to keep on antagonizing you. Making multiple accounts, getting others involved, attempting to frame you: these are all things they would probably attempt. But chances are that if they try any of this it's against the site's rules, and if the site has moderators, tell the moderators what's going on.

, Stand up for others, help new people, and be noble and respectable. Chances are if you do you'll get flamed a bit more, but other people will take notice and sometimes take a stand for you.

, Sometimes your only option left is to take a stand for yourself. If no one else will help you, and you've tried being a pacifist, this is your last choice. Don't go insane style on them, just be stern and strict. Be sharp and sophisticated. Their only reason left would be because they think your easy to walk over.

Decide what you will do next if you aren't successful in getting through.,
If you receive a negative response and the moderators decline your case, try to send your email again and ask for further clarification.,
If you do not succeed in overturning a ban, then you may wish to inform the moderator or administrator that you're leaving the site reluctantly and against your will.,
If you consider that you are a clear case of moderator's power abuse, then informing the admin might be the best thing you can do, since he or she will then reconsider his or her opinion regarding whom he or she trusts with the day-to-day running of the site.,
If you are given a definite end to the ban time, consider just sitting out your ban before returning.,
On the other hand, if you are still permanently banned, try creating another account if that forum/website allows it.",How to Get Unbanned From a Web Forum," If it says you have been blocked forever, then you want to follow the below steps. If it says the ban will eventually expire (for example, a 1 week ban on the 1st would expire on the 8th), then you may want to wait until it expires.;
, The reason will help you to understand what to avoid doing in the future, if your ban was justified. If the ban wasn't justified, decide whether or not this particular forum is worth your time. Based on the decision you have reached, you might or might not want to consider the following step.

, The easiest way to do this is to find ""Contact us"" or a similar link on the site.


Click on it. In the subject field, make it obvious that this is an apology and an inquiry about your ban terms.
In the message field, type your explanation of what you actually meant by any comment that upset the moderators and/or community, since moderators may have put a different meaning into what was said on the forum than what was actually meant.
Apologize for causing such an unfortunate misunderstanding. End your letter by apologizing and ensuring, and stating that you will be more clear in your posts in the future or that you will not repeat any of the behavior that lead to the ban again and make it clear that you have learned your lesson and are remorseful. Ask whether it is possible to have the ban lifted.
If you were involved in a flame war, then explain your POV and how you considered that you were defending yourself against what you saw as unjust claims from another member. However, do not spread blame––while there is always a chance that moderators have banned the wrong person, that is for them to work out. Accept your part in egging on the situation and take full responsibility for your behavior, making it clear that you won't do this again.
If your comment was actually offensive, and you regret saying that on the forum, then apologize and promise that this will not happen again in the future.

, The suggested process involving an apology and explanation might not actually work––you may be blocked from even using a message page or you may not receive a reply at all.


If you're logged into your banned account, you may need to log out and use a proxy that can lead you back to the website in its functional state.
If there is no response, consider sending an email to the main administrator. That email address often differs from more standard ""contact us"" emails. Re-type all of the necessary information, then resend your messages. However, you will have to do this through your email server. (Keep in mind that this email address is often not found on the website so you will have to look this email up on website like whois.com ,which tracks registration information regarding online websites. It is always possible that more than one email address is listed, so start with an email that is related to the website. If that fails, then consider contacting the main owner/admin through his/her more personal email.)
If there is no response, don't send the email over and over. Allow some time between resending your email. If you keep resending the email, it might be considered as spam and that only undermines your case.

Point out what aspects of their understanding might require clarifying from your end but do not suggest that they are wrongheaded or without grounds, as that will simply demonstrate belligerence and an unwillingness to listen and learn. Instead, communicate that you see their side of things but that you promise to make amends and, if you can, provide a demonstration of some good input that you have made on the site before, to show that you have the ability to continue with that. Send your response to see if that can change their mind.

Avoid making threats, such as not recommending their forum to anyone else, etc., as this will simply confirm that they've made the right decision.
Burning your bridges is unwise. Things change quickly in the online world. People who were once in charge change, other people simply move on to the next issue and eventually, you may find that you're forgiven by enough people to return. On the other hand, if you storm off and tear down the people who can help you as you leave, memories will be long and there will be less willingness to let you back.

, However, in very rare cases, the main admin is actually far worse than any of his or her admins regarding power abuse. So emailing him or her regarding your ban might result in your account being banned permanently.

, When you return, you can decide whether or not it's a wise idea to discuss your ban with moderators and or administrators in personal messages. Most importantly, when you do go back in, apologize to the community briefly without making references to blame or any persons––simply say that you have learned your lesson and that you're looking forward to contributing constructively again.

, If it doesn't allow this, it's up to you to decide whether or not it's worth circumnavigating this rule, realizing that if you're discovered, you probably won't get any support and will be banned again.


If you do rejoin as a new user, you will have to find a new username that is vastly different from your previous one, then you must provide a new email address since the previous one may well be locked with your banned account. You might have to consider using a proxy if your IP is banned, which makes the website inaccessible all together. Even if you're not IP banned, you might still want consider a proxy, since this will make it harder for moderators and admins to compare your new IP to your old one if they notice a similar posting pattern to your old account in your new one. Keep in mind that websites that don't allow banned users to rejoin, are banned without warning.

, This is known as ad hominem and is a logical fallacy and probably one of the most frequently used tactics on the Internet of distracting readers from the original topic or of attempting to discredit the poster. If the responder is employing ad hominem, then they have already gone a long way to losing all credibility to those that frequent the message board and understand even the most rudimentary processes of social discourse.

But after reading this, you wouldn't do that anyway, right?

, If you determine that the criticism is ad hominem, no response is necessary on your part. If you do respond, it may be only to point out their transgression of logical reasoning. It may be tempting to employ ad hominem of your own, but by doing so (no matter how well employed), you have just joined them as bottom feeders.

, So called ""Spam Bots"" gather these addresses and send massive amounts of spam to them. Writing an E-Mail address in one of the user profile fields is a much safer method.

, You can configure it to put new user registrations in a queue, that must be validated by an Administrator or Moderator in order to post messages. There are also modifications available for most discussion boards to put new posts containing hyperlinks in a moderation queue.

, This is very effective against automated registrations. During registration, an image with some letters or a word is presented to the user. The contents of that image need to be typed in a text box. This way a registration can only be performed by a human and not by a Spam Bot.

, Some websites maintain a list of known spammers. These lists include User Names, E-Mail addresses and IP addresses. One of these websites is called Stop Forum Spam (http://www.stopforumspam.com). Use this list as a reference.

, If a spammer is banned and creates a new user account with the same IP address, then use the IP banning feature of your board to prevent the IP address from accessing your board.

, Spammers usually use the Signature to put hyperlinks in them. To do this, disable Signatures for the User group ""Registered Users"". Then create a new User group based on the permissions of the User group ""Registered Users"", but with Signatures turned on. Set the User Promotion options to promote users from the Primary User group ""Registered users"" to the new User group that you have created after an X amount of posts are made.

Acknowledge that social media profiles do not always reflect reality.,
Avoid making comparisons.,
Post about good and bad things in your life.",How to Deal with Social Media Jealousy1," It is easy to be envious when scrolling through Facebook and Instagram because people typically post about positive experiences in their lives. They will share pictures from a recent trip to the Caribbean or an amazing music festival, like Coachella. When you see these photos you need to keep in mind that this is not a depiction of regular life.Remember that these people also experience difficulties in their lives, just like you do, but they are not sharing these difficulties on social media.
Additionally, the posts and photos that you see do not tell the true story of how the individuals are able to have these experiences. They may have their expenses paid by others, or they could be going into massive debt to maintain the lifestyle - things you might not want for yourself.
Also a lot of photographs posted to social media are cropped or edited using special filters to make them look even more pleasing than the original photo.
For example, photos can be brightened to make a day that was actually overcast appear sunny.;
, Most feelings of envy and jealousy that are associated with social media use are caused by comparing your actual life to the constructed lives of those you follow online. By constantly comparing your life to your friends, you may lose sight of the amazing things about your own life. Focus on what you have, not what your friends have.For example, someone you knew in grade school may have just gotten engaged to a successful, attractive lawyer, and you feel jealous because you are still single.
Instead, you should focus on the great parts of your life, such as your friends, career, home, health, and family. Appreciate what you have and be grateful for your own achievements.
When you feel yourself start to make comparisons, remind yourself that others are likely comparing themselves to you as well. While you may feel insecure that you didn't go on a great vacation this year or that you haven't found a partner, someone else might be thinking that your life is more carefree and exciting than theirs is or that your family appears to have a better relationship.

, Try and provide a more well-rounded and realistic portrayal of your own life by sharing both positive and negative experiences on social media. This will allow your followers to view you as a more authentic person. Do not reinforce the cycle of jealousy on social media by making your life appear perfect. If more people begin to share negative experiences it may change the culture of social media. Social media jealousy will decrease if people share both positive and negative experiences.For example, you could post photographs that didn’t turn out well and use self deprecating hashtags such as #selfiefail or #vacationfail etc.
You could post a social media rant about a negative experience you had that day, to demonstrate that your life is not always perfect and that you face stressful situations daily.
Consider sharing hard times that you're experiencing rather than just a mistake or a bad day. You may find that your friends can provide you with great support and advice during your time of need. Examples of things to share include a recent job loss, an illness, or the end of a relationship. Just remember to be tactful when sharing information that involves others.

Connect with actual friends on social media.,
Purge your social media accounts.,
Follow new accounts that inspire you.",How to Deal with Social Media Jealousy2," Most people use social media platforms, such as Facebook, to stay in touch with people. Although this can be an amazing tool, it can also lead to social media jealousy. For instance, you may follow multiple people who you went to high school or even grade school with, but haven’t actually seen in years. It is more likely that you will feel jealous looking at posts by former friends and acquaintances than actual friends.Only follow true friends on social media because this will give real life context to some of their posts, reducing instances of jealousy.
If someone becomes upset that you do not want to be friends on social media, then you'll know you made the right choice. You don't have to explain your choices to anyone. Focus on what's best for you.
You are more likely to be happy for the achievements of a close friend than a one-time acquaintance.

, Different social media platforms are used for different purposes. For instance, Facebook is typically used as a way to stay connected with friends. Alternatively, Instagram and Twitter can be used as a way to follow existing friends and make new connections. Regardless of the platform, you should go through the list of people you follow and delete or unfollow anyone who makes you feel worse about yourself, or any brands or companies that make you envious of their products and consequently inadequate.Never feel guilty or ashamed for unfollowing or deleting someone, even if that person is well-meaning, such as friend who shares a lot of ""inspiration"" posts. You are making choices that will help you simplify and feel better, and that has nothing to do with them as a person.
For instance, many companies, brands, and designers have Instagram accounts and will advertise their merchandise by posting professional photographs. These types of posts can cause you to be envious of material goods and make you feel as though your own possessions are not “good enough” or “cool enough.”

, Another way to avoid social media jealousy is to follow people that inspire you, rather than people who you feel competitive with. For instance, you may want to follow creative people that work in a completely different field than you. This way you may not compare your life to theirs, because you lead different lives, but you can find inspiration through their creativity and work ethic."

Log out of your social media accounts.,
Set goals for how you'll use social media.,
Unplug from social media.,
Choose to build relationships without social media.",How to Deal with Social Media Jealousy3," If you are suffering from social media jealousy, it is probably a good idea to reduce the amount of time you spend scrolling through social media feeds. One easy way to do this is to logout of your social media accounts. This will make it more difficult to access social media. Alternatively, you could delete social media apps, such as Facebook and Pinterest, from your phone or tablet. This way if you only have five minutes to kill, it will be more difficult to spend that time surfing social media sites., Plan how you'll use social media in a way that supports your mental health. For example, designate a time to catch up with friends and family and set a time limit for how long you'll spend on social media each day. Choose a time of day when you're less likely to get derailed by social media or depressed about what others are doing.

For example, don't start scrolling through social media when you're bored at work or school because it may cause you to spend more time scrolling. Additionally, you may feel worse about yourself since you're not having a fulfilling work day.
Try a time that precedes something you enjoy. For example, check your social media accounts before you head to your dance class at the gym or to meet a friend for coffee. You'll be more likely to stick to your time limit and have something fun going on in your own life.

, If you are beginning to feel depressed as a result of social media jealousy and you constantly find yourself comparing your life with people on your Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, or Twitter accounts, you should unplug from social media. This will allow you to focus more on your own life. You may find that you don’t even want that handbag your friend posted last week, and your small apartment is the perfect size.If you are not bombarded with images of people living amazing lives, you will begin to appreciate the things that you have in your own life. Make a habit of identifying things to be grateful for each day. Consider incorporating them into your journal, prayers, meditation, or therapy. You can also post a gratitude list in your home.
If you're not sure if you're feeling depressed because of social media, take time to ask yourself how you feel after you use it. Ask questions like, ""How do I feel about my life right now?"" and ""Do I feel satisfied with myself?""
If you're feeling down, see if it traces back to social media. Try journaling your thoughts to see if you're quietly comparing yourself to the people you follow.

, This may sound old fashioned, but one way to manage social media jealousy is to build and develop relationships without using social media. Getting together with friends face-to-face will help you get to know what is really happening in their day-to-day lives. You are more likely to feel compassion for your friends if you develop real and meaningful relationships. Try these tips to maintain friendships without social media:Call or text a friend to make plans, rather than send a message through a social media platform.
Get together with a friend to show them photos of your latest vacation, rather than just posting the images online.
Meet with a friend to congratulate them on their new job, engagement, wedding, or birth of a child rather than just “liking” or commenting on a social media post.
If you have friends or family who live out of town, consider using Skype or FaceTime to have face-to-face visits or communicating via telephone.

Do you have an existing blog dealing with specific subject matter? Are you a member of local clubs or organizations dedicated to one thing? Make sure the topic you choose to market is one that you are passionate about.;
, Make sure that it features words that are important to your subject matter.


If your subject matter is dog training, try to have the words ""dog"" or ""training"" in your web domain--both words if possible. Try to avoid misspelled words or unrelated slang. Topic-specific jargon is actually good in this case ,as it will help people who understand the topic know that you are intimate with it.

, If you have an existing blog hosted elsewhere, try to move it to your web domain or at least link to it with a menu link. Most major blogging sites have a way for you to move all of your content along with the blogging tools to a separate web domain.


You're going to have to design a site and create some content if you don't have a blog. There are plenty of resources out there for premade site templates that are easy to use and look professional. There are also many content management systems that are easy to learn.

, There are many reputable sites that are nothing but repositories of digital and physical products for affiliate marketing. Sign up for one and find the products that best match your site.

, If you have a blog, focus on more blogging. If you don't have a blog, figure out how you want to lay out your site and make sure that it lets visitors know you're an expert in the field.

, If you've selected more than one product, make sure that each link is related to the content of the website or Web page.


You may consider creating a whole page of suggested products with your affiliate links. Some affiliate programs may provide you with banner and leaderboard advertisements. Graphical ads can be very useful, but don't let them crowd your page.

, Some great ways to promote your site are to guest write for other prominent blogs or have their authors write for you. Also consider distributing video and pay-per-click advertising.

Quick Start


Go to http://www.talkspot.com and click on ""Get Started Now""
Next, enter a setup information, such as email, choose a password and pick a name for your website.,
This is just how TalkSpot sets your site up, for you to begin with.,
Log in


Currently, you're just like anyone else; a guest on your own website.,
Add a new webpage


Once you signed in, you should have noticed a bar that appears at the top of your webpage.,
Each of these squares represents a webpage template (the layout of a webpage).,
Now, you will have added a brand new page to your website.,
Let's give the new page a better, more descriptive name!,
Now that we have a blank slate, let's add something to the page!,
A blob is something you can add to a web page, which performs a specific function.,
Greenies are what you click on to add a blob to a webpage.

,
Think of your website like a large bulletin board, made of cork.,
This conceptual image was created to convey the idea behind the greenies.,
Pick any one of the greenies that is near the top center of your web page, and click on it.,
Find the ""Text"" blob, and click on it!,
Click on the pencil that appears at the top right corner of your newly created text blob.,
Click the greenie beneath your ""Hello World!"",
Find the text blob, and click on it, to add a second text blob to your web page.,
Click the greenie beneath your ""Hello World!"",
window.,
Weather Blob


Beneath your two text blobs, there is another greenie.,
Review your work.,
More Pages


Repeat step 3 to add a new page to your website.,
That's it!",How to Build a Free Website Using Talkspot.Com," Choose single, no-spaces, easy-to-remember keyword would you like to use in your website address. Click ""Next"".
Enter your contact information. This step is optional. Go to the next step.
All you have left is to click next and your website will be built. Make sure that all options are correct.
Together, we are going to create a webpage that looks like this above.
Using the information in your ""Welcome to Talkspot email"", you can either click on the link, or type your website address into your browser window. This will take you to your new website, so you can see what it looks like to the rest of the world. Yes - your website is live now around the world. This tutorial will give you the training you need to customize it.
When your site was built, one or more web pages was created for you. In addition to your ""Home"" page, you may see a ""Contact"" page, a ""Gallery"" page, and/or other web pages.;
, By the end of this tutorial, you will know what this all means and how to customize your website.

,
Your website has no idea who you are and is unable to differentiate you from other visitors. Because of this, you cannot make a change. If you could, anyone could!
Look for the copyright notice at the bottom of your home page. It will say ""© 2008 "" and then have your website name.
Click on your website's name.
Once you click on it, you will be shown a ""log in"" page, which will look similar to the following example.
Type in the email address and password you used when you registered for your new website, and then click the button which says ""SIGN IN NOW""

, This is the Administrator Tool Bar. It only appears for you. Visitors to your site do not see it.
Click the ""Add a New Page"" button from your admin bar.

, They are, in essence: variety. Each one is a little different and will allow you some variety in how your various pages are laid out, while still maintaining a consistent coloring and style. You will also notice each page type is labeled. The labels are just suggestions as to the kinds of web pages you can add to your website. In actuality, you can use the page templates for anything. For now, we're only interested on one - the one that says ""Universal or Blog."" It is usually the last one.


Click on the small circle at the top of the rectangle on the ""Universal or Blog"" template.
Click the Green button at the bottom of the page that says ""ADD A NEW PAGE USING THIS TEMPLATE

, It will have a large open space for adding content to your page.

,


You have just added a new webpage to your website. Every webpage on your website has a name, which is used by visitors to your site, to navigate the site. For instance, your home page, has the name ""Home"". The page we just added has the name ""Untitled"", which isn't very informative. So, we'll change its name to ""Tutorial Page"".
In your admin bar, you will see a white box with the word ""Untitled"". Place your cursor over the word, at the end of the ""d"", then hold your left button down and move the mouse to the left. This will highlight the word ""Untitled"". Press the ""Delete"" button on your keyboard, and then type ""Tutorial Page"" into this white box. Then, just to the right of the new page name is a green circle with a white checkmark inside of it. This is the submit button. Press it to make your new page name permanent! You will see the change immediately, in both the admin bar, as well as the in the menu on the page!

,


In the bottom left corner of your ""admin"" bar, you will see a button that says ""edit this page"". Click on the yellow symbol. This puts you into edit mode, so that you can make changes to the website.
You will notice that your webpage now looks slightly different. There will be some red outlined rectangles around the screen, and some little green plus signs. We call the little green plus signs: ""Greenies"". And, we call the red outlined boxes ""Blobs"".

, One of the blobs tells the weather, for example. Another one counts how many times someone has been to a page and then reports the overall number. That one is called the ""Page Counter"" blob. There is another which works like a word processor and yet others that show images, report news, and more!

,, Think of the greenies as ""thumbtacks"". If you had a large corkboard and wanted to post something to it, you would find a thumbtack and place your image, phone number, or ""what have you"", into an open space. The very same concept applies here!

, It does not exist on your site. Although, anywhere you see a greenie, is somewhere you can add something to your website.

,


This is a list of all the different types of blobs (the list varies depending on the TalkSpot system you chose when you built your site) that you can add to your website. The top left most blob type is different, so we'll ignore it for now. The rest of these boxes each represent a different type of blob, each with a specific function.
Before we add a blob, let's a take a look at TalkSpot's integrated help system
In the top-right corner of the screen, you will see a large red question mark. Wave your mouse cursor over this question mark. You will see some helpful information, describing the page! These helpful tidbits of information are spread throughout the entire system, to help you though any troubled times.
Now, if you look at each of the blob boxes, on the left side, you will see a smaller red question mark. Now, wave your mouse over one of those. Now, try another one! This integrated help system consists of hundreds of red questions marks, spread throughout the system, always ready to help, when you need it. No need to pop up another tool, or leave the page you're on. Just wave your mouse over any question mark and help will be on the way!

,


After a few seconds, you will now see on your screen something that resembles a word processor, like Microsoft Word.
Type the words: Hello World!
Click the Submit Button.
You should now see your ""Text Blob"" containing the text that you typed in.
To see how this web page would look to visitors to your website, look for ""Preview this page"" button in the upper left, and click it.
After looking at your page for a few seconds, click ""edit this page"" button. It appears where the Preview button was, and allows you to toggle back and forth between ""Edit Mode"" and ""Preview Mode""

,


You should see the Talkspot editor again (the thing that looks like a word processor).
Find where it says ""Example"" four different ways at the bottom of the editor, and choose the second button, instead of the first.
Press the green submit button, and you will see your text has changed size and color!
These 4 text styles are all intended to compliment your website. Each website is different, so while your colors may not exactly match this tutorial, you can be sure that these 4 text styles will always compliment your website!

, text blob.

,


Inside the text blob's editor type: My name is Pick a style for your text from the four words ""Example"" at the bottom of the editor.
Press the green submit button. Use the preview button, to see your webpage, as visitors to site will see it (Remember that visitors to your site will not see the administrators menu across the top of the page. It shows up only for you.)
When you are done looking at your page, click again so that we can make more changes.
Click on the pencil, on the blob you just created. We're going to make some more changes.
Using your mouse, highlight your name. While your name is highlighted, click on the large ""B"" in the top row of the editor's tools. This will Bold your name. Then, while your name is still highlighted, press the U in the top row of the editor's tools. This will Underline your name. You can use these tools in the editor to change the size, fonts, colors, and more! At the conclusion of this tutorial, we suggest you experiment with the various text formatting options available within the text blob.

, text blob.


Your goal is to position the cursor after your name. If you have trouble doing this, just click the mouse on any letter in your name, and use the right arrow on your keyboard to position the cursor so that it is after the end of your name.
Press enter, to create a new line
Click on the button that says ""Insert Image"" in the menu bar of the editor
Click on ""Upload a New Image"".
Click on the Browse button
Browse through your computer to locate your image. Once you have found it, double click on it, or select and press ""open""..
Press the green ""Start Upload"" button at the bottom of the page.
You should now see the picture you uploaded.
Click the GREEN Submit button
This will return you to the editor, with your picture now in the edit

,


Click the green SUBMIT button.
You should now be back on the webpage
Click on the Preview button (in the Administrator tool bar).
You should now see your webpage, with the picture you uploaded.
Click on ""Edit this Page"" to return to editing your webpage.

, Click it. We are going to add a more complex blob type to your web page - a ""Weather Blob"", which will give you a weather report.
Give a city or other location, such as a zip or postal code.
Click the green Submit button
Depending on whether or not you give it enough information, the ""weather"" blob may seek further information. If it does, simply fulfill its request. Upon completion, you will have added a whole different blob type, which will update any guest on your website as to the weather in your local city!

,


If you aren't already in preview mode, click on ""Preview This Page"". This is what the rest of the world sees!

,
Once you have added the new page, click the ""Edit this page"" button on the admin menu.
Find a greenie in a wide-ish space. All TalkSpot sites are different, so you may not have any. Nonetheless, find a greenie and click it. We're going to add your name to the site and your image!
Now, you will again be facing the list of blobs. The top-left most blob type is a little different. Click it.
You will now see a list of all the blobs that have been put on your website, including the ones that were on the webpage that we deleted.
Look through the list until you see the SimpleText blob beginning with ""My name is..."" and press the large greenie.

, Now you know how to add things you've already made! This can be extremely handy in the future! You can even put the same blob on all your pages, if you'd like, using this tool. Experiment with it!

Pick a creative and unique name.,
Choose a concise domain name.,
Keep it simple.",How to Pick a Good Domain Name for Your Website1," Unique names are names that you can build a brand around. At the same time, generic names are names that are easily forgotten or confused with competitors. Thus, try to find a domain name that your customers or visitors will be able to identify.


Think about tying two different words together. For example, the name YouTube is very simple, but is also memorable. Another example could be adding the words ""dog"" and ""lover"" together to get doglover.com.
Consider merging or mashing words together. A great example of this is the website Flickr.
Add a prefix or suffix to a word. Spotify is a great example of this.;
, The shorter your domain name, the easier it will be for people remember. Remembering a domain name is very important from a marketability perspective.


Internet experts suggest using one or two words if possible.
The less number of characters, the better. The average number of characters in the names of the top 100,000 websites is 9. A website like Amazon.com is well under this. A website named thebestonlinecandystore.com would be well over 9, and would make an unattractive domain name., In other words, choose a name that is easy to type and say. This will help visitors remember your website’s name. If you don’t have a simple name, people will forget it, might not be able to spell it, and may get it confused with other websites.


Don’t use numbers. In most instances, customers or visitors may forget numbers and confuse your website with another.
Stay away from hyphens. People will forget them.
Avoid acronyms. For example, an acronym of John’s Videos and Games (JVG) won’t tell potential customers much about your business.
Unless it’s catchy, your simple name should give visitors an idea of what they will find at your website.
Try saying the name of the website out loud. The best names roll of your tongue and are catchy. Good examples of this include Google, Amazon, Facebook, and YouTube."
"
Ask others.,
Run a search for similar names.,
Make sure your name is not trademarked.,
Pick the right extension.,
Consider different names.,
Play with a domain name generator.",How to Pick a Good Domain Name for Your Website2," You should always keep in mind that it’s not what you like, but what you have researched and know that your visitors/customers will like. Just because you like the name or think it sounds good does not mean everyone else is going to like it.


Run potential names by others in your organization. For example, if your website will sell goods, ask your sales managers. If you have a blog, ask other bloggers.
If you have a small website, ask family members or friends what they think of your potential names.
Hire a marketing or consulting firm to give you feedback or recommendations for names.

, Another way of researching potential names is to run an internet search to see what other people have. By exploring the internet and seeing what your competitors or even non-related businesses have chosen, you’ll get a lot of ideas.


Search for websites that are in the same business as you. For example, if you sell tools online, look for other tool websites.
Take a look at the names of the top 100, 500, or even 1000 websites. By doing this, you’ll get an idea of what the most successful websites have in common.
Use your search as an opportunity to rule out names that are already taken, or names that are very like those used by other companies., Be very careful not to register domain names that include trademarked names. Thus, you should search to see if your website does not violate someone’s trademark.


Stay away from domain names in which part of the name is trademarked. You might wind up having to give up your domain name (and the brand you’ve built around it.)
Even if you believe your domain name is untouchable by a business that has trademarked a name, do not take the chance. The cost of litigation is extremely high.
Search for trademarks at: https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/search-trademark-database., The extension you pick is very important, as it provides information about the type of business or website you are running. At the same time, the public has varying conceptions about different extensions. While most people trust “.com” extensions, they may be wary of “.biz” extensions.


The most popular and often preferred extension is the .com extension. Roughly 75% of websites have it.
Many web experts advise that if the .com is too expensive or is taken, you should probably try the .net or .org extensions – whichever is more appropriate. The .org extension is best used for nonprofit organizations. The .net extension is often used by companies that offer internet services.
Other popular extensions include .info .biz, and .us. The .info extension is best used for websites that offer information to the public, the .biz extension is best used for businesses, and the .us extension should be used by companies located in the United States.
Stay away from obscure extensions like .cheap or .camera., Once you’ve got an idea of what you want your name to be, you should make a list of a variants. By doing this, you’ll be able to experiment with different names that might be similar but could be more memorable.


Try simple changes in your name. For example, if your site will be called ""MikesTools.com"", you should also consider buying ""MikeTools.com"" and ""MikeTool.com.”
Try changing the subject of your name. For example, if the name of your company is Mike's Tools, you may want to consider domain names that target what you sell. For example, try ""buyhammers.com.”, Domain name generators will ask you to input a keyword and then will generate available names. While you may not like any of the names generated, they’ll provide you with ideas.


Use Wordoid. While this is not a domain name generator, you can input a word and it will provide you with new or similar words.
Experiment with DomainHole. This is a domain name generator that help you create new domain names based off a keyword you supply.
Other popular sites that may help you come up with ideas for your domain name include: Name Mesh, Dot-o-mator, NameStation, and Domainr."
"
Commit yourself to your domain name.,
Choose a name that allows room for growth.,
Avoid a trendy name.",How to Pick a Good Domain Name for Your Website3," Whatever domain name you decide on, you should make sure that you are committed to it for the long run. If you’re not, you’ll face substantial tangible and intangible costs if you decide to change in the future.


Make your domain name part of your business’s short, mid, and long-term business plans. For example, try to imagine where your web business will be in 1, 5, and 10 years.
Plan to stick with your name for the indefinite future. View your domain name as part of your overall brand and reputation., While it may be tempting to choose a name that gives a very specific sense of your business, it might be a better approach to pick a name that is a bit broader.


If you sell hardware, it might be tempting to pick a name that directly reflects that. However, such a specific name could limit your growth in the future if you choose to sell other types of products, too.
Unique and catchy names like “Amazon” or “Google” are simple and lend themselves to the ability to expand into different businesses., While it may be tempting to pick a name that reflects what is trendy at the moment, this could backfire as the trend fades. If you pick something trendy, your domain name could go out of fashion or seem dated in the future.


Stay away from slang, jargon, or trendy words of the moment. For example, words like “salty,” “dab,” “respek,” “suh,” or similar words that are popular with millennials now might be a recipe for failure in 5 or 10 years."

It is best to look up your problem in some sort of a search engine because most likely someone else has already had this problems and solved it.

, Some general tips while dealing with hardware are:


When handling hardware, be careful to keep your fingers on the sides of the board or on some sort of plastic or metal covering on something like a GPU to avoid getting oil from your fingers onto the delicate electrical circuits imprinted on the board.

Some of the most financially successful blogs provide news on a specific topic or targeted to a particular demographic. Mashable, a blog focused primarily on social media news, was founded by a teenager in 2005 and now attracts millions of dollars in investment funding.Many blogs post funny videos and images around a certain topic. Fail Blog is a famous example, posting examples of mishaps, misspellings, and other ""stupid"" actions. It makes its money primarily through advertising, and now sells a highly successful book as well.Some blogs are focused on getting paid to provide links to news articles, company stores, or other third party websites. The most financially successful of these range from the Drudge, a blog composed almost entirely of conservative-leaning news links, to Smashing Magazine, a site that provides advice and product reviews to help software developers.Additional common topics covered by the most valuable blogs include business (Business Insider), sports (SBNation), celebrity gossip (Perez Hilton), and music (Pitchfork).;
, In order to make money, you'll need to find a niche that other people haven't filled already, but is still popular enough to attract a significant number of visitors. Also consider other factors, such as money you'd have to spend if your blog focused on reviewing products that you in turn would have to buy.


Choose a specific niche, not a broad topic. Write about training for marathons, not general fitness. Write about making glass jewelry, not arts and crafts.
If you want to be famous or reach a wide audience, you will have to choose something slightly broader and work hard to make the best content for that topic. A subtopic relating to fitness, finance, or relationship advice is likely to reach the most people. Consider specific but broadly applicable topics such as managing money in college, or a marriage counseling blog.

, Use a search engine and the search bar on blog hosting sites to find blogs that cover your topic or related topic. Read a few blog posts from the most popular ones, that show up high on the search ranking, have the most comments, or display a readership of 20,000 or more.Get an idea for how much interest and competition there is.


If you can't find any popular blogs related to your topic, you probably went too niche. People interested in a topic will often visit several related blogs, and each blogger can link to the other to direct more traffic to each site.
If you find a popular blog that exactly covers your topic, be aware that it will be difficult to compete with them. Try to tweak your topic to a slightly different but related subject, so you complement the popular blogs instead of trying to overtake them.

, If you're not sure you have enough to write about, try writing as many article headlines as you can before you create your blog. If you can't think of at least thirty that fit your topic, you should choose something else that you know more about.

, Many people opt to create a free blog using popular services such as WordPress.com or Google Blogger. This is a good option for people who aren't familiar with web design, don't want to pay for their own hosting, or enjoy the ease and stability that comes with these services. These services do have limitations on how you can make money using them, however, so make sure your blog won't break the terms of service.



WordPress.com supports limited advertising, PayPal links, and limited affiliate links. The website will not host blogs that contain third party ad services, banner ads, sites primarily used for affiliate links, or any advertisements for get rich quick schemes, gambling, pornography, multi-level marketing, or ""disreputable merchants"".Google Blogger supports advertising through Google AdSense, PayPal links, and limited affiliate links. If you use excessive affiliate links, fail to add relevant content when including affiliate links, or get paid to increase someone's search engine ranking, Google will move your blog much lower in the search rankings, greatly decreasing your audience traffic.If you are not familiar with these terms, they are described under Monetizing Your Blog.

, If you purchase your own domain name, you will need to pay a hosting service monthly or annual fees to keep your website available. The advantage is greater customization, greater control over how to monetize your blog, and direct access to information on blog traffic for analysis.


If you aren't familiar with web design, you should have a knowledgeable friend assist you. Self hosted blogs are more easily affected by hackers or by mistakes from inexperienced owners.
Choose an easy-to-remember domain name, and use (yourname).com when possible if you are an author or other public figure.Confusingly, WordPress.org allows you to use WordPress software on your own, self-hosted blog. This is a good choice if you are familiar with WordPress.com, a free blog hosting service described above, but want the advantages of your own site.

, If you are using a free service, there should be a tutorial to guide you through the initial steps of setting up your blog, as well as a forum for people to ask questions. If you are hosting your own site, you will need someone with web design experience to customize your blog, or you can use software such as WordPress.org to use the same structures available at free services.


Most of these blog hosting services come with paid upgrades that allow greater customization and other benefits. Consider sticking with the free version until your blog turns out to be successful.

, Come up with your own topics for each blog post, and write the post yourself instead of tweaking or copy-pasting someone else's work. Readers will come to your blog if they enjoy your writing style and your choice of topic, not to read rehashed content they can easily find elsewhere.


You can gain readers by posting content that wasn't previously available online, such as scans of obscure or pre-20th century books and artwork. You should still add your own commentary around this content, however.

, None of the techniques for Monetizing Your Blog will matter if you let your blog stagnate. Try to post at least once a week, on a subject you haven't covered before that fits your blog's main topic.

, Keywords are the important words that relate to the topic of your blog, and specifically the new subtopic you cover each time you post. Choosing relevant keywords that people search for frequently will increase the visibility of your blog, attract more readers, and show them advertisements they are likely to click.


You can use the Google Keyword Research tool to get an estimate on how much Google is being paid for keywords by advertisers.

, Include them in your blog post title, the large ""headers"" introducing a new section, the first few sentences of your post, and in links. Change your settings so each blog post's URL includes the title of the post, not the date it was posted. Try to make these as descriptive as possible to raise your ranking in search results and attract the right audience.


Words displayed in images do not count as keywords.
If your blog software has a ""tagging"" function to add keywords to each post, use this as frequently and as accurately as possible.
If you are posting your blog using HTML instead of through blog software that does it for you, pay special attention to the <title> tag.

, Get traffic to your site with frequent updates on Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites. Find blogging communities that match your readership and post links to relevant articles on their comments or forums. This helps in getting traffic to your site as well as raising your search engine rankings.

, Contact other bloggers on social media and blogging sites, and help advertise each other's articles when the subject overlaps with both your audiences. Many bloggers are happy to post a link on twitter even if they aren't interested in advertising your blog on their own.


If you are using a free hosting service, excessive crosslinking may be punished. Only link to other blog posts occasionally, when they are relevant to your audience. More general links should be shared with your fans through social media instead of your blog.

, If you are serious about investing time and money into gaining an audience, you can create your own advertisements for Facebook, pay to add your blog to StumbleUpon, or become an advertiser on Google AdSense or another ad service.

, This is never easy or guaranteed, but it can also be fun to try even if you fail. if you manage to promote your blog through a video or image exciting or funny enough for people to share, and you're lucky enough to stand above the crowd of people trying to do the same thing, you'll have a huge influx of readers.


Create something within your budget. Unless you're running a company blog, you're unlikely to be able to get a crowd of extras or expensive equipment. Brainstorm silly ideas that can be performed by you and your friends.

, These techniques for making money are not useful for a blog that doesn't yet have an audience. Read about Marketing and Advertising first, even if you don't plan on including ads. At minimum, you should be posting links to your blog on social media website to attract readership.

, Once your blog contains high quality content and has begun to attract an audience, you can make money using Google Adsense, WordAds, or any other contextual ad service. These automatically generate ads in the amount, size, and placement you specify, matching the ads chosen to the topics you write about. The more readers who click on the ads shown on your site, the more money the advertisers will pay you.


Be aware that many blog hosting services only allow their proprietary contextual ad service, and may shut down your blog if you use one not made by the host company. If you are hosting your own blog, you should research contextual ad services and choose one that shows appropriate ads. Some allow pornography or other ads that may not be suitable for your blog.
Keywords are especially important when using third party ad services, since the ads are chosen based on the keywords you use. Inaccurate or insufficient keywords will result in ads that don't match your readers' interests.
If you are facing any issue in google adsense approval then you can try Media.net, BuySellAds, BlogAds, Chitika, Infolinks etc. some Google Adsense alternatives to make money from your blog., If you are an arts and crafts blogger, create a shop through etsy or another service for selling your artwork. If you are a writer or illustrator, search for a website that will sell T-shirts with your slogans or drawings on them. Many blog topics are not easily tied to products. You don't need to sell anything to make money, but if it fits your blog, do it.

, If you have an online store for selling arts and crafts, or you create T-shirt designs available through a clothing website, provide links to those sites. Including a PayPal button for quick, safe purchases or donations is a common way to monetize creative blogs, or blogs that provide free advice or assistance to those who can't afford it.


See How to Add PayPal to Blog for specific instructions.
Wordpress will only work with specific PayPal button settings. Do not choose any customization options besides, optionally, a custom image. Use your primary email address, not your secure merchant ID if you have one. Finally, copy paste the code under the email tab, not the website tab., By finding an affiliate program suitable for your blog, you agree to provide links to a company's products, and in return are paid for each reader who makes a purchase after following your link. You can find specific companies by searching an affiliate directory such as ClickBank, or by searching individual company websites for affiliate programs. Consider these factors before you choose an affiliate program:


If you are using a free blog hosting service instead of your own domain name, you must provide high quality content with a limited number of relevant links or risk being shut down. If you are only interested in writing short, quick product reviews in order to earn money, you will need to host your own blog. Be warned that low-content, high-link blogs are a less reliable, though lower effort, way to earn money.
Understand whether your affiliate program rewards the person who posts the first link, or the last. If you are paid only for being the last link clicked before a purchase, then you should not link to intermediate pages such as another blogger's review., This seems obvious, but it bears thinking about. If you write a cooking blog, recommend home kitchen tools, not expensive equipment for professional chefs. Consider what someone who is a fan of your topic would purchase, not just what active practitioners will.

, In the United States and some other countries, you are required by law to reveal to your readers that you receive material benefits from the manufacturer of the product. This includes affiliate link payments as well as gifts and cash offered in return for a review.

, Write your own content and recommend products that you have actually used and enjoyed. Give honest reviews, faults included, as though you were recommending the product to a friend. If you truly don't like a product, don't mention it or link to it.


Including links to the product within images or text in the middle of your blog post is a great way to get people to notice the link.
If you are using Google Blogger, know their policies or risk becoming invisible on their search engines. Any <a> tag containing an affiliate link should include instructions that stop your referral from boosting the ad buyer's search engine visibility: <a rel=""nofollow"">.

, For example: W.A.F.E (Water, Air, Fire, and Earth)

, For example: WA (water, air), EF (earth, fire). Each question will only have TWO options, comparing each one of the pairing results.

Determine your focus.,
Create some rough designs.,
Teach yourself basic HTML.",How to Make a Gaming Website1," There are a lot of different types of gaming websites out there. Knowing your focus before you start building the site will help during the design process. Websites often focus on one or two of the following areas when starting out. Once you build an audience and a staff, you can start expanding your focus.


News - The latest gaming headlines and stories. These drive the most traffic for gaming websites, but getting the scoop can be incredibly difficult.
Reviews - Another very important source of traffic, and one of the most popular forms of game-related writing. The reviews market is fairly saturated, so you'll need to do a lot to stand out.
Community - Building a community site is a great way to get involved in the gaming world. You won't be making the money that a news/reviews site would make, but you can gain a dedicated following.
Fan Site - Similar to a community, a fan-site is typically dedicated to one game or franchise. Popular fan-sites may get access to the developer for interviews and assets.
Wiki - Building a wiki about your favorite game can be rewarding and can lead to a great community.
Tips/Strategies/Cheats - Collections of cheats and strategies are a popular search topic, but you'll be up against some very strong competition.
Blog - A blog format allows you to simply post your thoughts and interests as they relate to gaming. A blog is a great way to practice your writing skills and build a dedicated following.
What sets you apart from the thousands of other gaming sites?;
, Before you get into the website creation process, it will help to have the basic layout and visual style worked out. Creating these sketches can range from drawing them on a napkin to creating mockups in Photoshop. Create a flowchart to show how the basic navigation of your site will work.

, Even if you're not going to be building the website yourself, you're still going to need some basic HTML so that you can update the site with your content. You can learn the basics in an afternoon, and with a little practice it will become second nature.

Get a WordPress account.,
After you've signed up for a WordPress account, become acquainted with the Dashboard.,
Think about your self-image.,
Make sure your layout is functional, simple, and aesthetically pleasing.,
Include separate pages that give quick insight into you and your business.,
Post to your blog periodically.,
If you’re having a hard time remaining motivated to post often, here are some ideas to help.,
Use social media sites to build exposure.",How to Make a WordPress Blog (for Freelance Editors)," It's important to make sure you're choosing an appropriate username for your blog as it will reflect the first impression of your business. This will be covered in further detail in Step 3.;
, The Dashboard is the interface WordPress uses for making all changes to your blog. WordPress has a video when you first sign up that will help get you started with its basic functions. You can use 'Pages' to place important information at the top of your blog, 'Categories' to keep your posts organized, and 'Widgets' (found under 'Appearance') to connect your blog to other social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.

, Turning yourself into a brand will make you stand out among other freelance editors. Consider the way branding works outside of freelance editing: are consumers more likely to buy a “Dawn” dish soap product, or are they more likely to buy a knock-off brand? Turning your business into a brand name will help make your work easily recognizable. Clients will feel comforted by the familiar appearance of a logo that is directly associated with your work.


What kinds of clientele would you like to bring in? Everyone looks for specific styles that fit with their needs. Ask yourself: ""How should my brand reflect me and my specialties? Do I specialize in short stories or poems? Books or brochures? Blogs or news articles?"" Your branding should not only reflect who you are as a person but also the clients you wish to serve.
What name do you choose to go by? You can always go by your real name, but sometimes we find that our real names do not lend well to branding. For instance, Christine Smith wants to start a wedding photography business, but the name Christine Smith does not flow as well as she’d like it to. She thinks about her middle name, Melissa, and decides to instead go by Christine Melissa. This softens the name to make it more suitable for a wedding photography business, but still remains true to her real name and her real nature.
Create a logo for your name. This logo will be used often, and should reflect your personal and professionalism. You can hire someone to design your logo or you can make it yourself using a program such as Adobe Photoshop or Gimp.
Repetitiously use the logo. This logo should be nice enough to put on your blog, resumes, and business cards. This will make your documentations uniform and easily recognizable.

, Though you have to buy the function that enables you to fully customize your layout, you can still design your own header and ensure you’ve chosen colors that are professional. You can also utilize the Categories and Pages to keep everything organized.


The layout should be personal to you. You are advised away from using pre-made layouts, because everyone else will have the same layout as yourself. WordPress has tutorials on how to make your own CSS, or you could hire someone to make one for you. Remember though that customizable layouts must be bought.
Navigation should be so simple that it takes less than three clicks to get to your desired area to prevent potential clients from getting lost or confused.
Put the most important of information in separate pages, such as resume information. This will be talked about more in Step 5.
Keep your posts organized by category. Notice common trends between some of them (such as articles and opinion posts) and separate them accordingly. Try to give each category an eye-catching name, such as “Writing Workshops” or “Editing Works.”
Are the colors you’ve chosen for the layout too bright or mismatching? If you’re going for a professional look, it’s probably not the best idea to choose a bright pink with purple polka-dots. You want your layout to be striking, but not so outrageous that future clients won’t take you seriously.

, This includes an About page, contact information, and a Resume page.


Your “About” page should be accessed from the top of the page. Make it apparent that you are a freelance editor and that you are currently looking for clients.
Contact Information should be easily accessible. It should either be placed in its own page, or within the About page. Be wary of the emails you provide. It would be in poor taste to use “hottiemctottie@xyz.com” as opposed to “exampleblog302@xyz.com”.
Give your resume its own page. Your Resume should contain concrete examples of your work, including portfolio work.

, Posts should be regular and relevant to your profession, and should always be double-checked for spelling and grammatical errors. Here are some ideas for finding relevant and interesting content.


Keep yourself updated with the editing/writing world by searching for relevant news via a search engine such as Google or Bing. Talk about conventions and organizations that you admire, are a part of, or would like to attend.
Write about your own personal experiences that pertain to editing, but keep them fun and professional. This will create a personal feeling for your blog and will help potential clients feel more connected to you.
Give personal advice aimed towards other editors that reflects your knowledge of the industry. Potential topics: How to stay motivated when facing a harsh deadline or How to get over obstacles that stand in the way of your goals.
Review a book you’ve recently read.
Write about other blogs. If you find a fun blog or an interesting person, don’t hesitate to write a review about them. This is also an excellent way to build up your networking. If you’d feel more comfortable asking them permission first, then send them a friendly message. If they decline, then find another person who would not mind being written about.

,


Set personal goals for yourself, such as having 5 posts done in one month. WordPress has a post count that can help you monitor these goals.
Keep yourself honest by saying on your blog how often you intend to post. Will you operate on a Monday Wednesday Friday schedule? Or Tuesday Thursday? Find what days you have the most time and then make it clear that you “Update Tuesdays and Thursdays” at the top of your blog.
Write about things you find interesting. If you force yourself to write about things you do not find interesting, then you may lose motivation to write.
Keep a journal of ideas for days when you feel stuck on what to write. You might be surprised to find an excellent idea you’ve jotted down weeks ago.

, This is a strategic step that will help build a community around your blog. As long as you’re an active participant in updating your social media sites and in interacting with others, you should be able to build up a solid reader-base.


Attach your blog to outside social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. This can be done with the use of the widgets. You can also include this information where you’ve provided your email.
Link to other blogs and sites of related interest. It is likely the administrator of the site will appreciate the exposure and then add a link back to your site. If you feel more comfortable, you can ask them beforehand if they don’t mind you linking to them. Never assume that the favor will be returned, though, since it is in poor taste to expect them to feel the same way. Place these links in their own page titled “Helpful Links” or “Affiliates.”
Write reviews of blogs you particularly admire. Again, if it would make you feel more comfortable, feel free to ask them permission first.
Comment on other blogs often. Try to engage in intelligent conversation. Be sure to double-check your grammar and spelling.
Interact with your readers in the comments often. Again, double-check your grammar and spelling.
Always be on the look-out for new opportunities to socialize and build your network. Above all, communicate.

Build the website.,
Find a host.,
Upload your site.,
Add your initial content.",How to Make a Gaming Website2," You can either build the website yourself or contract the development to a web development company. There are a large variety of site-builders out there, or you can code it from scratch if you're confident in your abilities.


Make sure that the website can handle all of the features you want to use. For example, if you want users to be able to comment, you'll probably want an account management tool. If you plan on streaming video, you'll need to ensure that your website will allow you to easily embed streams.
Try to get website proposals from several different web design companies. This will give you options and allow you to pick the style that matches your needs the most.

, A web host is a company that hosts your website on their server. You can find free hosting, but this is generally unsuitable for a moderate amount of viewers. You'll want to find a good host that allows you to scale as your site grows.


There are few things more headache-inducing than changing hosts once your website gets big. Choosing the right host from the outset can make things a lot easier down the line.

, Once your site is ready, you will need to upload it to your host server. If you used your host's site-building tools, this will happen automatically. Otherwise, you will need to publish it using an FTP client to access your server.

, You're going to want some content ready to go before your site goes live. Without any content, no one is going to come to your site. The content you create is dependent on the type of site you are creating. Below are a few examples:


If you are creating a review site, publish a review of whatever game you just finished, even if it's older. This will give you some experience writing and give people something that can be found in a search.
If you're writing a game news site, find some recent press releases that relate to your niche (PC, consoles, handhelds, company, etc.). Publish these press releases and add a few opinion pieces surrounding these press releases.
If you are writing guides, write a detailed guide for your favorite game. Make it in-depth and try to cover aspects that aren't covered in detail in other guides.

"
"
Continue to add content.,
Make your content the best in its area.,
Hire a staff.,
Continue to innovate and experiment.",How to Make a Gaming Website3," What you add depends on the focus of your site. The content of your site is what will determine how popular your site becomes. It is what sets you apart from other gaming sites in your niche.


If you're writing articles, your writing voice will be incredibly important for developing your site's style. Good writing will attract lots of readers, so you should always be striving to improve your skills.
Proofread everything you write before you publish it online. Grammatical errors and other problems will lead to a less-professional site, which will drive away readers.
If you are using screenshots or video from a video game, ensure that you have the rights to use it, especially if you make a profit on the site.

, You need to stand out. You are competing with some of the most popular sites that cater to some of the most tech-savvy readers online. Not only are you competing against established sites, you're competing against YouTube channels, Twitch streams, and popular podcasts.If you're writing a guide on a game, make sure that your guide is clearer and easier to understand than other guides online. Consider adding unique content that can't be found elsewhere, such as the perfect screenshot or a hand-crafted map.
If you're going for the news angle, you'll be need to distinguish yourself from the heavy hitters. Getting interviews that the other sites don't and writing high-quality features about the more ignored aspects of the industry can really help separate you from the pack.
If you are doing reviews, you'll need to ensure that you cover all of your bases. When reviewing a game, focus on all of the individual aspects, as well as the sum of all the parts. Make note of issues or outstanding moments, and try to maintain a fair view. When reviewing, personal preference for genre or franchise should be set aside, and the game should be looked at as objectively as possible.

, If you want to compete with other sites, you'll need multiple contributors. The biggest gaming sites on the internet post over a dozen articles per weekday, all from a variety of contributors. Building a good staff with unique takes on your content will help make your site shine

, The gaming media world is constantly changing and reinventing itself. Try to stay on top of or set trends to ensure that your audience keeps coming back. Look for ways to improve or change the way the present your content, and interact with gaming in general.


For example, game review methodology and scoring is a very controversial and rapidly-changing area of gaming media. Finding new ways to express review scores and objectively review content will help you make a big name for yourself."

Learn all the rules.,
Be nice.,
Start a blog.,
Always follow the rules, never break them.,
Report bad chobots if it is necessary.,
If people are being mean or hurtful towards other members, the first action you take is by telling them to stop, or calm down.,
It would be helpful if you are friends with a moderator, because they will see you are working very hard towards being an agent.,
Never be rude.,
Do not get a chat ban.,
Do not ask moderators or other agents to become an agent.,
Lastly, you might like to become a citizen.,
Become a moderator's favorite user.",How to Be an Agent on Chobots," Agents help people. But you'll have to know and understand all the rules before taking actions.;
, Help new chobots, and older ones. Help new ones by showing them around, giving tips and advice. Tell them how to buy clothes, magic and hoverboards. You could also show them how to play games and trade items.

, You can make a free blog at Blogger or Wordpress. Ask people on chobots to follow your blog. Remember to customise your blog and keep it updated regularly. Also, you could join the journalist program to get extra help.

, Never use bad language, don't bully users. You can find the rules on the blog.

, You can also use the emergency message to notify the moderators of anything that is very serious. Make sure to check the right boxes according to why you are reporting them.

, If this continues, report them, and in the worst case, message a moderator.

, Talk to them regularly, get to know them, and they will help recommend you.

, This is a simple rule that should be very easy to follow if you have already gotten this far.

, This means following rules about chat, no bad words, no hurtful comments, and do not bully other users verbally.

, This is the worst thing to do. If moderators or agents know that you aren't trying very hard, and just asking to become an agent, you will lower your chances of achieving the overall goal - agency. Like before, make friends with them, but never ask.

, Obviously, this is optional, and doesn't really affect your chances of agency, but it shows that you enjoy the game enough to become a citizen.

, This increases your chance on becoming an agent and will more likely add you to the nominated Chobots list.

You will be asked for your email address because an activation email must be sent to you to activate your account; otherwise you can't log in, even if you've supposedly created an account. Retrieve the email and follow the link provided in it, that will activate your account. Log in afterwards.

, There are a lot of things you can write on Quizilla (for example stories and lyrics), but quizzes are the most popular and the easiest to create.

, Under the Quizzes category, you can create either a quiz or a test. Choose Personality Quiz for something that tells the quiz taker something about themselves, for example ""What kind of student are you?"". Choose Test if the topic of the quiz is something measurable, or if you want to test the reader's knowledge on a certain topic (""How much do you know about The Beatles?""). However, it's recommendable to start making tests only after you're familiar with quizzes; besides, this article is only about quizzes.

, The topic must be either very interesting or very popular, for it to have many views. Check the Ultimate list and the Most Popular list for ideas.


Don't make a quiz on an overused subject; if there are too many quizzes of the same type, then it's very unlikely to have many people take it. The list of overused subjects include:

Naruto quizzes (sorry Naruto fans, but the topic is way too popular on Quizilla for a particular Naruto quiz to be distinct);
Teen subculture quizzes- the ""Are you a prep, a jock, a nerd, a goth/emo, a scene kid or a skater?"" quizzes; they're even considered insulting when the author seems to part with one subculture or another and you may even receive hate mail if the reader didn't get the desired/expected result;
Subjects most teens are desperate to find out about: the ""Are you popular?"" or the ""Does your crush like you back?"" quizzes- you may write about this only if you follow some rules mentioned further in the article;


Also, don't make personally related quizzes. It's very unlikely that the person who takes the quiz is extremely interested in a random user of a website. Still, Quizilla abounds in quizzes like ""Would I date you?"", ""Which one of my friends/classmates are you?"", ""How much like me are you?"" and so on. If you want readers to find out about you, post info about you on your user page.
If you want to write about a subject that is highly subjective, such as ""Are you beautiful?"", don't insult the reader in the results if their results don't match your beauty standards; you don't even know if they answered the questions honestly. Even a worse mistake many people make is to make all the questions to an ""Are you beautiful?"" quiz lead to the same result, saying that everyone is beautiful in their own way. If you do so, why on earth did you even make the quiz in the first place?! The results are meant to be informative and as accurate as possible.
Be original. There are things people want to find out about their personality, which they don't even think about until someone comes up with the bright idea to make a quiz about it. Use your imagination; brainstorm anything that can be considered interesting and original. Some examples are:

Quizzes that correlate the reader with some kind of object/holiday/place/movie etc.
Quizzes that are related to somebody's subconscious, dreams, positive and negative traits; possible interpretations of those things;



, By now, you must have already thought of the subject you want to write about. Formulate the title of the quiz as a question- for example, ""How popular are you?"" or ""What color suits your personality?"". Capitalize each word of the title, to make it look more professional. Stick to the question; additional info like ""nice pics in results!"" or ""the ultimate quiz!!!"" or any other words meant to attract the reader's attention, are simply pointless and annoying.

, Here you can mention the pictures in the results or such things. Write here everything the reader needs to know about the quiz, things you couldn't mention in the title. The introduction must be pretty short; don't make it unnecessarily long.

, This proves very helpful later; making a quiz without planning it before often results in having the three components of a quiz (questions, answers and results) not correspond with each other. You'll need to plan the quiz in this order: write the results first, the questions second and the answers third, because you will have to write the questions depending on the results and the answers depending on the questions.


Remember that the number of results must be approximately as big as the number of answers for each question, because in the end you'll have to correlate each answer to the result.

, As stated above, you need to write the results first because you will be guided by them when making questions. The results must be related to the idea/title of the quiz. If the title is, for example, ""How popular are you?"", then the results will be like ""The most popular in your school"" (Result 1), ""Popular"" (Result 2), ""Somehow popular"" (Result 3), ""Not very popular"" (Result 4) and ""The class loner"" (Result 5). Remember: When it says ""Result #(number of result)"" you only write the title of the result; you will detail it further in the ""Description"" section. This is very important.


Add pictures to your results. If you go on Quizilla very often, it's more than likely that you have seen thousands of pictures in other quizzes' results- just save every single one of them in your computer. Soon you'll have a huge arsenal of pictures ready to use for your own results. However, try to find pictures yourself or personalize those you already have, since it's a more original choice. Try not to put anime pictures; they're overused.






Give advice in the results, if you think it's necessary. Especially if it's a ""How (random adjective) are you?"" quiz, then you'll have to give some advice in the results. You can even use advice from wikiHow!







, The questions and their answers are the heart of the whole quiz. Your quiz should contain 5 to 15 questions; any less than that is too brief and incomplete and any more than that is boring and unnecessarily long. Be careful not to make a question too long, otherwise it may not appear complete in the quiz; more precisely, a question should not exceed 260 characters; the 261st character will not appear in the question. Before the site was updated, there was no character limit for questions or answers, but this allowed the creation of chain letters, so the administrators decided to set a character limit.


Don't make questions too predictable; try to be subtle. A quiz loses its charm if the quiz takers know what result they will get from the very moment they read the first question.
Don't add personal reference to your questions. For example, don't make the question like, ""Do you like dogs? (I hate dogs, I don't know how come you can stand them, if you can)"". The reader doesn't really care about your own personal opinion. Same with results. Example: Question: ""What's your favorite color?""; Your answer:""Pink (You prep! I hate pink!"") or ""Black (me too! You rock!)"". Remember the quiz is all about the reader, not you.
Careful when writing a role-play situation (RP) as a question. Role-plays are imaginary situations the readers must put themselves into, and think how they would react.

First of all, role-plays are usually long. Especially if you're not sure if your role-play would fit into the 260-character limit, don't add unnecessary descriptions to the question (for example, don't put ""RP time!"" at the beginning of the sentence; just write it right as it is).
Be realistic. Unless you're making a quiz on fantasy, stick to the possible, to real life situations the readers can find themselves in. For example, if the RP is ""You see a little kid being bullied by a few thugs. What do you do?"", don't put answers like ""I use my magic wand to turn them into frogs"", since no human being can do such a thing.


Avoid asking the dreaded ""What's your favorite color?"" question. Everybody who has been around Quizilla for quite a while purely hates it. It's used at almost every freaking quiz.

, Give each question a few results; write at least 3 results for each question. The answers must stick both to the questions and to the corresponding results; that's why making suitable answers is perhaps the most difficult thing in making a quiz.


Keep in mind that, when writing the answers, you have two choices: you can make a question either single-select or multi-select. It's advisable that you only put multi-select questions when the nature of the question requires it; otherwise only use single-select, because an all-multi-select-question quiz will mess up the results.
Always give an intermediary answer to a yes/no question or to a ""how much"" question; quiz takers will often stop taking the quiz if they see they haven't got more than two choices for each result.
Add logical answers to each question. Random answers may seem fun, but they're often completely irrelevant to the results.
Careful! The character limit for answers is twice as small as the one for questions: 130 characters. You may have problems respecting it.
The Right Amount of answers compared to results. (I.E. 3 results = 3 answers with every question.) The points lead to different results depending on the amount of points for each answer.

, There is a ""Select or create result"" box in front of each answer. Choose one result for each corresponding answer. That's why it's recommended to put the same number of results and answers per question in your quiz- so that each answer at a question will have a corresponding result.

, Now your quiz is created. Good. You're now at the ""Options"" screen. In the Security section, you have a few options by which you can restrict access to your quizzes. It can be viewed by either everybody (recommended), your friends (meaning other users of Quizilla you've added as friends), or only people who know the password (case in which you must set a password). You can also have a few options related to what others may do with your quiz: you can allow or deny other users to comment your quiz, to share it with others on their Myspace, and to view all results (check Yes; people often like to see what they might have gotten if they checked other answers). In the second section, you can tag the quiz to categorize it alongside other (more or less) related quizzes. Try to be as specific as you can in tagging. Again, save it.

, Preview it if you want to. Now, wait for other people to take it and comment on your work.

, Never pressure or force anyone into a sex scene.

, Most people prefer at least a single paragraph, but some others allow one-lining. Just make sure you check the other person's preference (usually in the form of Roleplaying Rules in blogs) before trying to roleplay with others.

, This includes layout designs, storyline ideas, pictures, display names, biographies, roleplaying rules, etc. Don't be afraid to ask someone if you can copy something, 9 times out of 10 they'll say ""Yes,"" and they'll expect credit so whatever you borrowed from someone, make sure you write ""Credit to: "" under whatever you took.

, Accept constructive criticism, be nice, don't take things said in roleplay personally, make friends, chat up, etc. Be easy to get along with, and great roleplaying opportunities shall come your way.

, If you want to start a Chatzy, don't be extremely strict about it. Ban people if they're being rude to other members, not if you just simply don't like them. Also, if someone is being mean to another person, don't back them up because you think it's funny. Remember, not everyone in there is having as much fun as you, and don't act like you're entitled to do something and others that accidentally do the same thing you do are copycats. Be nice, and again, don't declare supreme power by giving certain people administrator rights and playing around with the rights with one or two other people. Be nice, courteous, don't single others out, and don't gang up on someone.

, If you want to assign moderators of the group, don't let them all be other accounts you have control over, especially if no one knows that those accounts are you (that's called sock puppeteering). It's not fun if you get people to join only to declare supreme power over them, because that'll make you look like a control freak and it'll cause people to leave. Let the members of the group be independent and if they don't want to participate sometimes then let them be. Only talk to them if they turn down opportunities consistently.

Determine the keywords and phrases that bring visitors to your website.,
Write blog posts that contain your main keywords.,
Publish blog content on a consistent basis.,
Ask questions to readers within your blog posts.,
Network with other blogs related to your industry.,
Add share buttons to your blog posts.",How to Increase Traffic on Your Website by Blogging," When you write blog posts that contain keywords that are relevant to your industry or business, the keyword density on your website will increase and result in more visitors.


Use website analytic tools to review the keywords that bring visitors to your website. An example of a website analytic tool you can use is Google Analytics.;
, For example, if you run a business selling coffee, and your main keywords are ""coffee"" and ""coffee beans,"" blog about different types of coffee beans, recipes that include coffee, how to grind coffee beans, and more.

, The frequency at which you publish new blog posts can vary depending on the nature and size of your business, your writing style, and how often breaking news updates occur in your industry.


Publish quality blog posts as often as possible; as this practice will increase the number of indexed pages on your website and create multiple entry points into your website from search engines and other sources.
Add a guest book, daily poll or survey, or an interactive forum to your blog if you do not have the ability to publish new blog content often. This can increase traffic by allowing new content to be published on your blog and recognized by search engine algorithms.

, Embedding questions throughout your blog posts or at the end of blog posts will help engage your readers and generate discussion about your content.


Ask questions that are related to the content within your blog post. For example, if you run a dog grooming business, write a blog post about the dog shampoo products you use, then ask your readers about the types of dog shampoo products they recommend.
Verify that the comments section of your blog posts are enabled before asking your readers questions, which will allow their responses and discussions to be published within that particular blog post.

, This can help bring new visitors to your website and create link-back opportunities to your website from other sites.


Comment on blog posts on other websites. In most cases, you will have the ability to include the link to your own website within the comment thread. For example, if you are part of the construction industry, visit home improvement blogs and provide helpful tips or suggestions on certain topics, then include a link back to your own contracting or construction business.

, This will give readers who find your information interesting or useful the opportunity to share your blog post with others via email and other social networking platforms.


Consult with your webmaster or blogging platform to determine how you can add share buttons to your blog posts. Examples of share buttons that can be added are Twitter, Facebook, StumbleUpon, Digg, Reddit, and more.

You are not the only one with this problem, it is becoming more and more common and more and more well known. Do not be embarrassed; find others with the same problem and help each other beat it.;
, Make sure not to turn it on too many times a week. If you have a laptop, make sure to put it somewhere that you can remember but not somewhere that you see every day. Try keeping the lid closed when you are not using it; when the computer is not looking at you, you are less likely to use it. If you have a desktop PC, try not to go near it or put something over it like a sheet.

, Call a friend and ask them to go outside for at least 3 hours a day. This will distract you from the computer. If you're in school, try doing your homework together over the phone or in person.

, Before using your computer decide on a time limit such as 30 minutes. Set the clock or timer and make sure that you get off the computer when the time is up. Alternatively create a shutdown timer shortcut on your desktop (google search ""shutdown timer"" for tutorials). This can be programmed to shutdown your computer after a predesignated time after it has been activated.


Every time you log on to different sites, set yourself a timer, and a small list of what you want to do within that time, and then try to make yourself log off when the time is up. Do this constantly, but try to reduce the amount of time you are on the page by 5 minutes each time.

, If there are pages which you look at constantly for information, simply copy all the text and save it in a file, or even print it off. This will stop you from using the Internet so often, and it will stop you from drifting to another page.

, You won't be as tempted to look at certain websites and they do have a limit on how long you can stay online. Also, the library is a good place to get some good books and magazines to read, so you won't be as tempted to be on the Internet at home.

, Get involved with teams, clubs, sports, church, music, dancing, singing, etc. Go for a run with a friend or get exercise some other way. Go to bed on time and get a good night's rest. Keep up with the local events in your community. There may be talks, film screenings, concerts, local sporting events, and book signings etc. Find some, as long as it is not on the internet, and get involved.

, If you are a student then do your homework and study. If you're in the working world, prioritize what you actually need to get done, rather than procrastinating with internet activities. Make a to-do list for each day and stick to it, only allowing yourself fun-focused internet time or distractions after you're through with your other obligations

, Anything that gets you off the computer for a while will help and increase your confidence that you can stay off even longer. Cook or bake something one night for the family.


Don't eat meals at your computer! Eating at a separate place will help you to not go online.

, Plan a trip to the bowling alley, mall, or ice rink. Get a friend to walk a dog with you for the afternoon. Avoid places that have free internet access such as coffee shops.

, Instead of watching TV or doing individual things during dinner time, eat dinner as a family on the table and plan games afterward.

Understand the stages of domain name release.,
Purchase a program to obtain accurate drop information on various domains.,
Back-order the domain name from its registrar site.,
Hire a drop catcher, or shark, to snatch your domain once released.",How to Acquire an Expired Domain,"


Domain names are not available on the day they expire. Registrars will often wait 40 days before ejecting the previous owner and then hold the name for another 30 days or so in hopes the owner will renew. The actual release date, then, can be quite difficult to track and requires extreme diligence.
Once the domain name is actually dropped, the registry releases the names for only a few unscheduled hours.;
,


Search the database for expiring names and select one you would like to register for yourself. Usually this involves entering keywords for domain names, but you can also enter the exact domain name for which you are looking. For example, if you are interested in acquiring a domain name with the word ""raisin"" in it, type ""raisin"" into the search box. A list of all expiring domain names that contain the word ""raisin"" will appear.
Find out when the domain name is scheduled to drop by frequently checking the database for changes in the domain's status.

,


There are websites that allow users to back-order domain names. The domain name you want to register may or may not be on one of these sites. You should check just in case. Customers can back-order domain names before they expire. This situates them on a list and the domain name is offered upon expiration.

,


Sign up with a major drop catcher. These services do the work of domain name bidding for you by flooding the system with multiple requests. The various shark services charge fees that range from 10 dollars to more than 100 dollars depending on the specific service you request.
Participate in a domain name auction if more than 1 person wants your domain. The customer who bids the highest is given the expired domain.

Know what's out there about you.,
Contact the offending website.,
Make changes to existing content.,
Request removal of information from Google.,
Delete obsolete accounts.,
Be proactive.,
Tag your content.,
Bury the content you don't want to be found.",How to Ungoogle Yourself," Whether you call it self-search, vanity search, or egogoogling, it's a good idea to check in with yourself from time to time. This is especially true when you're thinking about taking on a new career (or new significant other, who will no doubt be Googling you after they're done ogling you).


Search for your full name—with and without middle name—and also search for your family name, any nicknames and aliases you might have, and any other variation of your name that you can think of.
For example, if you regularly comment on a political blog under the name ""AlwaysRight,"" for example, Google that. Then Google ""AlwaysRight"" ""Your Realname"", quotation marks and all. This will force the search engine to return a very specific result that contains both sets of words, to see if the two names can be linked.;
, There are occasions where a particular website, blog, or even friend on Facebook has posted an unflattering image or embarrassing quote from you, and Google has dutifully immortalized that on their pages. While Google will do nothing, the person who posted the information can do something.


If they are a friend, just contact them informally and ask them to please remove the offending content. They may not even realize it's embarrassing to you: maybe everybody at that party got tagged doing you-know-what!
If they are not a friend, send them an email, written as you would write any business correspondence. Be polite, proper, professional, and direct. You can say something like:

""Dear ; I'm pleased you follow me on Twitter, but would you kindly remove that post I made the other night about the Governor? I regret that I was not at my best that evening, and the allegations I made about his family tree do not reflect my true feelings. Thank you for your consideration. Regards, Ms. Oopsie.""
This will not remove the Google result, but anybody interested on your thoughts about the Governor will only see a ""404-Not Found"" page, if the webmaster honors your request.


Do not threaten legal action unless the content is truly libelous, not just offensive. If you feel this is the case, contact your attorney before threatening legal remedies. If it comes to that, your attorney's letter will carry much more weight than yours. They might also post your threats online.
If the person you are making the request to is acting in a malicious manner, do not send them an email: that can be selectively copied and pasted to further embarrass you. Send them written correspondence via the postal service instead.

, For content that you can control, such as Facebook pages or Twitter tweets, make changes to the page linked to in the Google results.


Log into the account, follow the link from the search result itself, then either delete the post or picture, or simply modify them with something less problematic.

, Google rarely will remove information unless it is violating their policies. Examples of what Google will remove would be: someone posting your Government ID number, Tax identification number, adult spam, and so on.


If the information is showing on Google search, you can fill out the form that Google provides here: https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2744324

Remember if the offensive information is on a website that is not Google, any action Google takes will only remove the information from Google. It may still be available on a source website.

, While old accounts may not contain embarrassing information, it's always a good idea to remove information that's no longer current.


If you had a Myspace page back at the turn of the century, and you haven't visited it for 15 years, it's time to shut it down. Chances are, you have changed significantly in those 15 years, in both style and substance. If somebody is searching for you, no need for them to see that side of you!
Consider deleting any online account that contains information that could be embarrassing. Google results are based on relevance, and if the source (your old account) is gone, there's very little relevance there. Even if you have a completely unique name, the result will be pushed far down on the list. Only the most dedicated snoop will even read past the top of the page.
Change any personal information on sites such as Facebook, or set the privacy so that personal information is not visible to anybody but you.
Change your name. While the links may still be active on Google, changing your name on the account page may at least leave the searcher puzzled over where they landed.

, Google cannot crawl what they cannot see, and you cannot be identified by what you do not choose to share. Be very selective on who, when, and where you share any personal information.


This is especially true in online forums or games, where you do not really know the other people involved. Always use an impersonal user name, and never share your real information or pictures with anybody you wouldn't want knocking on your door.
For professional or commercial accounts such as cable or Netflix, keep your user name abbreviated. Instead of calling yourself ""joe.realname,"" use ""jrealname,"" or if your real last name is very unique, try reversing things: ""josephr.""
For email accounts, follow the same general guidelines, but also create a couple spam guard accounts that you can use for your ""public"" email address. For example, instead of using ""joerealname@yahoo.com"" as your Facebook email address, create an email account just for Facebook: ""joeyr.facebook@yahoo.com. That way, if you are compromised, you can simply delete the compromised account, and your ""real"" email account remains secure.
Use these techniques whenever you are asked to put your name out in a public location that Google bots can find and index. You can't stop them from finding you, but you can prevent them from pointing to the real you.

, If you want to continue publishing information under your name but don't want it appearing in any search results, use an HTML metatag: <meta name=""robots"" content=""noindex,nofollow"" />

For one week, write down everything you do while using the Internet. What websites you visit, how much time you spend on each, how often you refresh or update pages, each time you click on an embedded link, etc. Often our worst Internet time-wasting habits are things we do mindlessly.Make sure you include the time you spend using the network on your smart phone or other hand-held device. For people with on-the-go lifestyles, this is often where we clock in most of our Internet hours!;
, Checking our email or refreshing our Twitter feed every five minutes is an impulse that keeps us from being able to focus on longer tasks. If the paper we’re researching begins to feel frustrating or boring, it seems harmless to take a 10-second break in order to see if something more exciting is going on in another window. The problem, though, is that all these little breaks, plus the time it takes us to refocus our attention as it shifts back and forth, really add up. Particular habits will vary from person to person, but some examples might include:


Do you check your email fifty times in a day?
Perhaps you spend an appalling amount of time on celebrity gossip blogs or websites?
Maybe you keep yourself logged in to Google Chat or Facebook Messenger when you’re doing other things, and find you are frequently interrupted by friends looking to chat?
Or maybe you find that after thirty minutes of concentrating hard on something, you get a sudden intense “craving” to see if anyone new has “liked” your new Facebook profile picture, and then just get sucked into your newsfeed for an hour or more?

, It might seem like your friend is being hyperbolic when she says something like “I’m totally addicted to my iPhone!”, but there’s actual science behind this. Technology dependence actually changes the way our brains work, very similar to the changes a brain undergoes in the instance of drug, alcohol, or gambling addictions.


The culprit is a chemical in our brain called dopamine, which controls our moods, motivation, and sense of reward.
Every time you hear the bloop of your Facebook messenger, a little surge of dopamine is released in your brain, which is what triggers the urge to check it.
Dopamine addiction is an endless cycle. The brief “high” is caused by the anticipation, the uncertainty of the unknown. Who could the message be from? Usually the urge to find out is greater than the satisfaction we feel once we’ve actually seen the message, which leaves us feeling a little low, and eager for another dopamine boost.
While technology dependence is becoming increasingly common in today’s world, we don’t have to be slaves to our dopamine receptors. With a little mindfulness and dedication, we can train ourselves to resist this eternally unsatisfying, unproductive loop. , For many people, unlearning pre-existing habits can be difficult, especially at first.


Recognize that most of these changes are going to require restricting yourself things that bring you comfort or pleasure.
It’s not uncommon to even experience mild withdrawal symptoms when we begin to alter our Internet behaviors in this way, due to the decrease in dopamine production.
Keep in mind that this transitional discomfort is temporary, and that you are on your way to being a happier, healthier, and more productive person. , It’s amazing how much space we free up in our brains just by having a workspace free of visual distractions. If there’s a pile of papers begging to be organized, or dirty dishes scattered around, it’s going to be more difficult to focus on the task at hand. Try to keep your desk (or other work area) free of everything but current projects and whatever items you use every day.

, Make sure to keep your files organized into folders, rather that splattered all over your screen, and bookmark websites you use frequently. This will save you a lot of time when it comes to searching for things you need, and will keep you from being distracted by something that catches your eye in the searching process. , Is there a song you’ve been meaning to listen to? Do you need to read some restaurant reviews to figure out where to bring your mom for her birthday? Do you need to need to research costs for a home-improvement project?


This is something you should be doing throughout the day, every day, as things pop into your head.
Keeping an Internet to-do list will give you a clearer sense of purpose, and remind you of your long-term time-management goals.

, Some people are most alert first thing in the morning, others don’t reach their peak until the middle of the night. If you have some flexibility in your daily schedule, try to plan your Internet time for when you are most likely to be awake, energized, and thinking clearly.

, Internet efficacy is going to mean something different to everyone, depending on career, interests, and other lifestyle factors. Some people need to be logged on all day long for their jobs, while others primarily use the Internet in the evenings as a way to unwind.


While the specific time-management goals will vary from person to person, everyone should be aiming to simultaneously accomplish more while also spending less time online.

, In other words, simply aiming to spend less time on the Internet in general is a good start. While it may seem counter-intuitive, we tend to be more productive when we have a shorter window in which to get something done.

, While it might seem like it’s more productive to do two or three things at once, it can actually slow us down in the long run, as we’re not able to give our full attention to any one thing. It might be tempting to switch back and forth between Internet tasks in order to keep things interesting, but try to stick to your Internet to do list, finishing each thing before you move on to the next.

, If you need to read something longer than a page, such as an article or proposal, see if you can download it, and read it with your browser closed. If you need to write a long email reply, try composing it in Microsoft Word.


This will further minimize distractions, by preventing you from going down hyperlink rabbit holes, or protecting you from the bloops or dings of email notifications as they inevitably trickle in.

, This is something you’re going to want to be tough with yourself about, as these websites are not only black holes for productivity, but also very addictive.


If you remember, dopamine thrives on anticipation and the unknown, and social networking sites are never static, always changing as people update their statuses, add photos, “like” things. And nothing is actually ever as interesting or fulfilling as we think it might be.
If you must visit sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc., do so with great awareness, and give yourself a strict time limit. Try using a kitchen timer to keep yourself on track.
It's important to actually sign off of and close these websites, rather than just opening a new tab or window on top of them. The easier something is to access, the more tempting it is.

, Try checking your email just three times daily: once in the morning, once around lunch time, and once in the evening. Your email, while necessary, can be as bad for time-management as social networking sites if you are constantly refreshing or checking it incessantly.


Make sure to trash, archive, or respond to every new email in each sitting. This will not only save you time in the long run, but will give you a sense of accomplishment as you stay on top of your correspondences.

, If you are having trouble abiding by the restrictions you’ve set for yourself, you’re not the only one! A majority of people find it challenging to efficiently managing their Internet time. So many people, in fact, there are a bunch of free or cheap downloadable applications out there to help you with just this. Here are just a few examples:



RescueTime keeps you from being able to access certain websites for a certain amount of time. Let’s say you’re working on a paper about different types of cloud formations; you'll be able to access Google, and the National Weather Service website that it directs you to, but you can block Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Buzzfeed, or any other website that might tempt you to lose your focus. It also keeps track of your daily Internet habits for you, letting you know how much time you spend on email, on Skype, on wikiHow, etc. There are many other Internet-blocking applications available, all with slightly different parameters or additional features. Find one that works well for you!

The Email Game turns plowing through your email into a timed game. You earn points the faster you can clear your inbox!
Pocket allows you to save websites you come across for viewing at a more convenient time. Maybe you're reading an article that includes and enticing hyperlinked article. You can save this link, or anything else, to look at later.

focus@will is an application that uses brain science and soothing music to help increase your attention span and productivity, which will decrease the impulse to seek easy distractions. , While this might seem like an extreme measure for some, it will absolutely force you to plan out the majority of your Internet usage, inherently making more productive use of your Internet time. If you're struggling a lot with self-control, this might be something to look into. Having to use the Internet with other people around also has the potential to make you more aware of your bad habits. You'll be less likely to unconsciously browse your way over to your recent ex-boyfriend's Facebook page if you're sitting in the window of a café where anyone who walks past can see your laptop screen, for instance.
If you want to experiment with this idea but aren't ready to make the full-blown commitment of canceling your internet service, try stashing your router at a friend's house for a few days.
Or if you live with a roommate or spouse who's not amenable to the idea of going Internet-free, have them them change wifi password.

Learn the way connection speeds are measured.,
Understand the basics of connecting to a server.,
Know the difference between uploading versus downloading.,
Understand ping.",How to Test Internet Speed2," Connection speeds are measured in Mbps. This stands for Megabits Per Second. Mbps is the standard method of calculating transfer speeds. The most important thing to note is that a megabit (Mb) is different than a megabyte (MB).


File sizes are typically measured in MBs.
A megabit is 1000000 bits, which translates to about 125 kilobytes. A megabyte is made of 1024 kilobytes.
This means that a 10 Mbps connection will deliver download speeds up to 1.25 MBps.

, Connections are made to servers. A server is the location where you are retrieving data from. Servers are physical objects, and their relative distance to your computer will affect the speed at which you connect to them.


All things being equal, you will download a file faster from a server that is 10 miles (16 km) away as opposed to a server that is 500 miles (800 km) away.

, When you download something, you are retrieving a file from a server. When you upload, you are sending a file to a server. Internet connections are typically significantly faster downloading than uploading.

, Ping measures time to connect. The ping is a measurement of how long a message takes to reach one end of the connection to the other. This affects how long a download may take to get started, but does not affect overall transfer rate.

They may send you spam and junk data to promote their financial and promotional intention.;
, Using different password for different sites will protect you such cases, if your one ID has been hacked. And if you’re using the same password for all the sites it’ll create the risk for all if one is hacked.

, Antivirus programs help to scan, detect and remove the malware from your device. They also provide the protection when you’re online and surfing the information. So run a software which can provide in-depth security in real-time on a regular basis.

, Often you would have seen that lots of advertisements keep on nagging on your system display. They offer very attractive deals and forces the users to click on them. And once when you click on them, they ask you to make the payment or provide your personal and financial information. Ultimately, in this way, anonymously you allow them to misuse your details.

, The wireless router is the first firewall or line of defense, so, don’t leave it ‘Open’. To secure your network, make some necessary changes like to enable encryption option, exchange default SSID with your own unique ID and keep a different password for web access.

, Once your system is hacked, hackers install ‘back doors’ to get the access at any point. Check your email account settings to ensure that nothing is being forwarded to other accounts. Check your security question and email address, is it altered or same?

, When you’re using your social media accounts, you need to be very careful. You don’t know what attachment keeps what. So to stay protected don’t download the document received from unknown resources and don’t like or share everything without paying attention to it.

, You may not feel it, but the regular updates send by your operating system and other major programs are really important from the safety aspect. Because with these regular updates the developers put shielded protection for your computer and keep it up-to-date in the consistently changing and threatening environment.

If you don't know how to open up your router's settings, review the instructions that came with your router or do an Internet search for the information using your router's make and model. Generally, your router will be opened by either typing its IP address or by typing ""router"" without the quotation marks into your internet browser.;
, If a port is open and you would prefer it not to be, this may be because your wireless router's firewall is turned off. Check to see if it is still working properly, and whether or not it has port 21 listed as open.

, This will be called something different depending on the brand of your wireless router, but it will usually be named something related to ports, port forwarding, or virtual servers. In this section will be a list of ports that are kept open, or forwarded, and the programs that use them. If you see port 21 listed here, remove the listing. This tells your router you don't want that particular port open.

, When you've removed any reference within your router to port 21 being open, restart your router and your computer just to be sure. Now when you check your open ports again, port 21 will be closed.

The first one of several is PHProxy.,
The next script is CGI Proxy.,
This next script is my favorite: Glype.",How to Create a Proxy," This is a script written in the PHP scripting language, and is easily the most often used. Here's how to set it up:


Either setup your own web server, or get a web hosting account. There are many web-hosts both free and paid. Any one that allows php, such as awardspace.com, will work.
Download the script.
Upload the included files to your server or webhost. That's all you need, but you can change the way your proxy looks using CSS to customize the template.;
, This one is a bit frustrating. If you have your own server, install cgi/perl on it. If you have some webhost online, find one that supports CGI scripts. One good one is tripod.com.


All you should need to do is upload the nph-proxy file to the right directory, but chances are it won't work because of some unknown reason. you can also try using the automated installer (Google it) which requires an ftp account. Some, but not all free webhosts offer this.
Unless you have some magic touch, you will likely have failed. This is normal. if you don't know perl, this script is impossible.

, Glype is steadily gaining popularity, and is available at glype.com


This script needs php and Curl access. The only free webhost that offers this is 000webhost.com. If you have your own server then there is no issue.
Open the folder and zip the upload folder.
Upload the upload folder, and then link to it. Everything should work.

The basic Step to configuring the firewall is identifying the type of firewall you have.First find out the firewall in the computer.,
Remember that the Windows XP firewall cannot be found in the tray icon.,Shortcut to Windows XP firewall - Click Windows Start, select Run, enter firewall.cpl and press Enter

,
Look whether the firewall software is a personal firewall or it is a Corporate firewall.,
Once you have found the firewall open the firewall software from the programs menu or by right click and click on open at the tray icon in the bottom right hand corner.

,
After opening the firewall, look for the option which says program settings, configuration,or program control.,
Once you are in the Program settings, Program Configuration screen look for the particular Internet Based application and its status, whether it is permitted to access internet or blocked.,
Click on Add application or program and then go to the particular path for the application and add it.,
Once you have found the program name and added it to the firewall programs list, then set the preference to permit accessing internet.

,
Once the application has been permitted to access the internet without interruption, then you should be able to update your program easily without disabling the firewall.

,
If you are using Windows XP, then click on start button, and go to the Control Panel.,
In order to find out the exact version of Windows in your computer, click on Start Button and click on Run menu option.,

Most of the latest firewall software come under a Security center software.;
, In order to find the Windows XP firewall you need to go into the Control panel from the Start menu and then find it.

,, If it is a personal firewall, you can configure it easily. If it is a corporate firewall, its better suggested to contact the product vendor to know the configuration.

,, If you do not find a program setting option in the firewall main screen, then go to the options, settings, configure option and then you definitely should find that option.

, If the application is not listed, then you definitely should have a button for adding application.

, Most of the Windows based applications are installed under the program files folder. You can very well go to the folder using the path ""C:\Program Files"". Once you have identified the folder for your application look for the executable files in the folder. All the executable files come with an extension of .exe or .com only.

,,, In Control Panel click on Security Center. Note: This is applicable only if you have the Service Pack 2 installed in Windows XP.

, In the Run box type ""winver"" without quotes and click OK. Once you click on the Ok button you will get a screen with the exact Windows version with the latest service pack installed in your computer. If you have Service pack 2 follow further.

, If you have clicked on the Windows Security Center, then click on the Windows firewall button or link in the Security Center screen.

,, Once the application is found put a check mark before it so that it can access internet without interruption. If the program is not listed, then click on add, then add the appropriate application.

, You should choose to auto-detect network cards (you have to do this twice, for two cards) it should do this without any errors - you did buy the realtek/ne2000 cards, right? after you have auto-detected the cards, you want to tell it that you want a RED-GREEN network. This means, essentially, that one network card is connected to the outside world, and one is connected to your computer(s) at your location. you can assign either of the cards to either color, which you choose is irrelevant, just make sure you assign both.

, Doing so after the other devices have had a chance to establish their connections will most likely change your computer's public IP address.

You may want to check your IP address again to make sure it has changed.

, In some rare cases, you may have a static IP address assigned by your internet service provider. In order to get this changed, you will need to contact their technical support directly. Oftentimes, this can only be changed once., This will display a different IP address for your connection; often, it will be an address from a different part of the country or world.

, Instead, type the address that you normally use to communicate with the company in your web browser yourself and check for problems.


You can try to left click on the link and see if the address where you're actually being sent will appear, but the scammers have mostly disabled that feature because so many people were getting the message to check the authenticity of an address in that way.

, You can find them by typing ""exposing a hoax"" in your favorite search engine.

, If the person claims to be from your bank or credit card company, ask for a name and explain that you will look up the phone number and call back. Do not use a phone number supplied by the caller. Look it up yourself or call information for the number.


If the person hangs up, you should report the call to the company they claimed to represent. Most, if not all, of these companies keep records on these scams.

, Also toss any that want you to deal with money orders, either sending or receiving. If you receive these letters in an email, delegate it to the ""Spam"" folder.

They will not work for subscription sites like Netflix or Hulu which are protected. A few of the more popular video downloader sites include Keepvid, Clipconverter, Videograbby, and Savido.


Consider installing an ad-blocking extension. Many of these sites have a lot of ads which can misdirect you or even infect your computer with malware. See Block Internet Ads for a guide on finding and installing an ad blocker for your browser.
Microsoft Edge does not support ad blocking extensions. Consider using another browser to download your videos, or just be careful when using the downloader site.

, There will often be quite a few options to pick from, all with different formats and resolutions.


The MP4 format is the most universal option and will work on most devices with needing conversion.
The highest quality video will usually be 720p (1280x720). The 1080p option will often have separate audio and video streams, which will require combining later.
Select the highest quality option for computers or most modern portable devices.

, The video should begin downloading to your computer immediately.


If the video starts playing your browser instead of downloading, return to the list of downloads, right-click the link, and select ""Save link as.""

, The video will usually appear in your default download folder, unless you were prompted to select a location and chose somewhere else.


Some services will rename the video to ""videoplayback"" instead of the title of the video.
If you are having trouble playing the video it may be a file extension issue, as certain players don't accept certain video file extensions. Try an open-source media player like VLC or MPC-HC - these accept multiple extension types and should be able to play your video if the download was completed correctly.

, This is where you will adjust the pointer speed, which is what most people refer to as “mouse sensitivity.”

, Moving the pointer to the right raises the speed/sensitivity. Moving it to the left slows it down and makes it more precise., This option adjusts the DPI (Dots Per Inch) on the fly to match how quickly you are moving the mouse.This option gives you more control over the pointer so it moves at the exact speed as your hand (or finger, if you are using a trackpad).


If you are using your mouse for gaming, this setting might interfere with precision in your game. Gamers often opt NOT to use this feature for that reason., If you like, you can also change how quickly a double-click registers.

You can download the software for most mice from the mouse manufacturer’s website. Visit the website (e.g., www.logitech.com) and navigate to the product page for your specific model. Follow the download link for your operating system.
If there is no software available for your mouse, use Changing Pointer Speed in Windows or Changing Pointer Speed on a Mac. You won’t be able to change the DPI, but you can increase and decrease the pointer speed.

, This varies depending on your model and manufacturer.

, Depending on your mouse, you may see a dropdown menu containing DPI values (e.g., 800, 1600, etc) or a slider. Increasing the DPI value from the default increases the speed of the pointer, and decreasing enhances precision.


There is no “ideal DPI” as it is a matter of preference. Start by setting it close to the vertical resolution of your monitor.If your monitor is 1920 x 1080, for example, try setting the DPI at 1200 (or as close as you can get to 1080).

Make a list of the components you need.,
Figure out how powerful you want your components to be.,
Decide which CPU brand you want.,
Decide which GPU brand you want.,
Look up the newest technologies.,
Decide how much you want to spend on the particular computer part.,
Do some individual research on the parts before settling the budget.,
Compare prices.,
Check for compatibility of parts before purchase.,
Purchase an appropriately plentiful power supply.",How to Choose the Right Computer Components on a Budget," If you're building an entire computer from scratch, you'll need the following parts if you don't already have any of them:


Motherboard
Ram
CPU
Graphics card(optional if your motherboard has integrated graphics)
Power supply
Hard drive
Solid state drive(optional)
Optical drive(optional)
Case.;
, If you don't know exactly how much computing power you'll need, you can check the ""recommended system requirements"" on the software you plan on using for a rough idea. However, keep in mind that you'll probably want to make your machine last well for a long time, so that you'll still be able to run the newer software that will be released in the future. If your budget is tight, higher quality may not be an option, in which case, you'll need to get the best you can actually afford.

, There are two dominant brands of CPU manufacturers, those being AMD and Intel. Generally speaking, Intel chipsets tend to be more expensive than their AMD counterparts, but they have the benefit of usually performing better and arguably they provide better architecture.

, Similar to above, the modern-day GPU industry is dominated by two giant rivals: nVidia and AMD. However nVidia cards tend to be more expensive; once again, they tend to outperform their AMD counterparts.

, Also see if new parts or brands are about to be released. New technologies are often better; generally, more efficient versions of components are released every few months, but the consumer price seems to stay more or less the same, so it's very important that you get the newest technologies available, and if you find that something useful, it's generally worth it to wait a short while to get hold of those newer technologies.

, Setting in place a sensible budget with upper limits will help you to stay within your means and not purchase things you cannot really afford right now. This will involve knowing current prices for both used and new parts and doing some comparisons between sellers and stores.

, As you research, use the internet, as this will make this easier for you. However, it can be a good idea also to call around or drop into stores and ask questions directly. Research the quality, performance feedback on forums, price (see next) and other relevant features. Keep a notebook or spreadsheet of information found, so that you can compare with ease when you have finished checking everything out.

, Find a few models that you think could work and then find some benchmarks comparing the performance of both. Typically the only things you really need to compare with benchmarks are CPUs and GPUs, and if you decide to purchase a solid state drive, those can also vary a lot in terms of speed.


Shop around so that you can find the best price. Compare prices on websites which are known to have the best prices. Go into stores as well and ask them what their best deal is.
Beware of deals that sound too good to be true. They may be fraudulent deals or stolen goods.

, Make sure that all the parts you wish to get are compatible with each other and will work properly once assembled. Picking incompatible parts may lead to system instability or outright failure to function.


Make sure the case you buy will fit your motherboard. An ATX motherboard (and the rest of the components) probably won't fit into a micro-ATX case. Be sure to buy the appropriate size.
Buy your motherboard and CPU in a bundle if you can. Usually a bundle will work out to be cheaper and you'll know for sure they're compatible. If you don't buy them as a bundle, you absolutely have to make sure that they are both compatible or your CPU simply won't work.
Make sure that you have the right type of RAM. DDR4 RAM won't work in a motherboard that uses DDR3 RAM and vice versa, so be sure to get the appropriate kind.

, If you're using two big video cards, the chances are that a medium 550 watt will be too little. Do a little research and see what would be appropriate for your build.

Know your requirements .,
Scanners are classified on the basis of four features:


Resolution - A normal resolution scanner (not more than 1200 dpi) is perfect for home use as well as for scanning text and images.,
Cost - Find out the scanner that best satisfies your requirements and try to fit it into your budget.",How to Choose a Computer Scanner," The type of scanner needed for home-use will be very different from that needed for business applications or heavy usage.;
, The resolution of scanners needed for business applications changes with requirement. For example, scanners required for cutting-edge photographic work requires high resolution while normal text scanning for business purposes requires normal resolution.
Bit Depth - Scanners with higher bit depths tend to produce better color images.Today, most color scanners are at least 24-bit and are perfect for normal use. For those wanting better image quality, 30 and 36-bit scanners are available.
Dynamic Range - Another important criteria for evaluating a scanner is the unit's dynamic range. It is a measure of how wide a range of tones the scanner can record. Most color scanners have a dynamic range of about 2.4. It is a good idea to go for a scanner that offers a higher dynamic range depending on your budget.
Speed - Speed becomes a factor when purchasing a scanner for commercial purposes. Heavy users will need a scanner with a high scanning speed. Most home scanners have optimum speeds for home and light use. However, the speed is the biggest factor in pricing, so choose wisely. The scanning speed can be determined by taking a few sample scans.

, If it is too costly, find out which feature of a scanner you will require most for your purpose and choose a scanner which scores high for that particular feature and a little less on others.

Shut down your PC and remove the power cord and turn the power switch to off.,
Open your computer-case.,
Next you need to check whether or not you have the required slot open.,
Once you found out the type of motherboard you have look for images or specifications of the motherboard.,
Anyway now you know how many PC slots you have from the image or motherboard specs, now you need to count how many cards there actually are installed, this can be fairly easy done by counting the amount of horizontal lines which have ports at the back of your computer if your computer is a tower (standing up straight rather then laying on his side).

,
There is, of course, a chance the slots are taken, in this case you might want to remove one of the cards to make room for the WiFi card.

,

Note that removing one of the cards may cause sound to stop working or even the monitor or other needed stuff.",How to Check if Your Computer Can Have a Wifi Card,";
, Note that opening your case may void warranty. If you still have warranty or you are uncertain your warranty has voided already check this first. If you do not want to void warranty read the tips and then skip to the bottom part of this guide.

, There are like 6 different slots you can come across. Usually the types are listed somewhere near the slots. The slots are the plastic bar-like looking things on the motherboard. The slots you want are PCI slots. Usually they have a beige color though they may vary a bit. They will always be close to the back of your computer and always facing the same direction. If any of them is free this means you can install a WiFi card. (Note: If you do not want to void warranty read the tips first then continue to read the guide).

, Now you will be able to see if you have the needed PCI slot.

,,, Do not remove any of the cards before knowing what they do. If all else fails, go to a local IT-shop or the closest IT-person you can find.

Determine the goal, or the task you want to accomplish with your PC.,
Start picking out the other parts first (the CPU, RAM, Power Supply, etc).,
Try to find a motherboard that meets your specifications.,
Pick the best bang for your buck.,
Review your choice and see if that is really what you need.,
Buy your motherboard.

",How to Buy a Motherboard," Either it's a multimedia machine, gaming, or office use. This is a very important step, as different machines will have different requirements, e.g. an office computer will require a much less powerful machine than one designed for gaming.;
, Choosing a motherboard is a backward process, especially if it's the first time a person is performing this. Remember to keep in mind what the purpose of your PC will be, and also remember to read reviews on your products before buying them, just because something looks good on the seller's website, or is more expensive than another product, doesn't mean it will perform the best of all of your other options.

, There are a few requirements that you have to keep in mind.


Every motherboard is designed for a specific CPU slot. Ensure that you select the right socket for the CPU that you chose. For instance, an AMD CPU can have AM3, AM3+, FM2, or FM2+ sockets, while an Intel CPU might have LGA 2011, LGA 1156, LGA 1155, or LGA 1150 sockets.
Every motherboard is also designed with specific RAM speed and type. If you are going to get, say, 240-pin DDR3 1333 (PC 10660), then you need a motherboard that can support 240-pin DDR3 1333 (PC 10660).
If you are going to be purchasing PCI components, ensure your motherboard has enough of the correct types of slots for all of your components.
Make sure your motherboard will actually fit in your case, for instance, if you buy a microATX case, you won't be able to fit an ATX motherboard inside of it.
Make sure your power supply can support the motherboard, for instance, if your power supply only has a 20-pin motherboard connector, and your motherboard needs 24 pins, or if your power supply only has four pins for CPU power, and your motherboard needs eight (remember, motherboards usually have two power connections, not counting any accessories).

, One of the most obvious steps. Buy a middle performance CPU in the latest technology with a middle performance motherboard, it will be cheap and effective.

, Take your time and don't rush.

Understand a few principles of computer coolingMoving parts get much noisier as they move a little faster.,
Choose a case.The ""tower"" type is best because it can go under a desk, distancing the computer from the ears, while allowing the removable-disk drives to be reached easily and not consuming much floor space.,
Choose a motherboard.Full ATX is best for a quiet PC because it lets expansion cards be spaced out for better cooling.,
Choose a CPU cooler.This will generally be a heatsink with an attached fan, also known as a ""HSF"" or simply a ""heatsink"".,
Choose fans.Slow-moving 120mm fans are best.,
Mount and arrange fans.,
Choose video cards.Look for something that has a dual-slot cooler (which has room for a much bigger, slower, quieter fan) and exhausts hot air out of the case directly.,
Choose hard drives.,
Choose a power supply.A power supply converts alternating current from the mains into direct current at various voltages your computer can use.,
Finished.

",How to Build a Powerful Quiet Computer," Two big, slow fans will be quieter than and move as much air as a big medium-speed fan, or one or more small or medium-size medium-speed or fast fans.
Air flows more easily thorough a large continuous space than through a series of narrow spaces with the same total cross-section. A heatsink with very-closely-spaced fins is for maximum performance with a powerful fan, to make sure most of the air molecules bump into it and carry away heat before they're blown out and away. It's not better with a slow fan, but moderately-spaced, thin, smooth fins as most heatsinks are usually fine.A given amount of energy (and noise) will much more easily suck in cool air or blow out hot air through a big fan and open grate than a lot of little fans and little holes.
Heat needs to be removed from components, and from the case. Exhausting it to the outside directly avoids unnecessary work and noise removing it with a separate fan.

Don't rely on the power-supply fan for removing much heat from the inside of the computer. The power supply needs to be kept cool too. If most of the rest of the computer's heat has to flow through the power supply, the power supplies life will simply be shortened and/or its not-easily-replaceable and not-necessarily-very-quiet fan will automatically increase speed.


Most components need at least a little cooling. One or more case fans for a flow pattern eliminating dead spots is best. If you have multiple expansion cards and some produce much heat (see if they have heatsinks on them, or if they feel hot after use), direct a fan to cool them directly. As usual, a big quiet fan, mountable directly on some cases, is preferable.
Mechanical components such as fans and hard drives should be soft-mounted so that they cannot transfer their vibration to the wide case panels, which efficiently transfer it to large amounts of air and make noise. Isolated, these components dissipate vibration mostly as negligible amounts of heat within themselves.
A fan sucks air in from all directions toward one side, then blows it out the other in a narrow stream. So, it's more effective to blow air toward something to be cooled a distance away, or to create an overall draft. If the fan is directly against something, such as a heatsink, the direction is not very important and should be chosen to assist rather than fight overall air flow. Sometimes fans can be noisy when one side or another is obstructed due to the fan pushing against its bearings. Using wire fan grills, rather than grates, can reduce the unwanted back pressure.;
, Look for the following features:


Large vents to let air in toward the front (often holes around the sides of a plastic bezel and a perforated steel plate behind it) and preferably a front fan mount. Big exhaust fans at the back won't do much good unless air can easily flow into and throughout the computer before blowing out.
All-120mm fan mounts. This is the standard ""big"" fan size. Fans bundled with cases might be quiet enough, particularly if their speed is adjustable, but don't count on it.
Unobstructed fan openings. Grids of little round holes are bad; large perforations making an open mesh is good.
Plenty of width, so a big CPU cooler protruding off the motherboard will fit. Most mid-size and full towers are pretty wide.
Long video card compatibility, at least 10.5 inches (26.7 cm).
Plenty of 5.25 inch (13.3 cm) hard drive bays, if you will use hard-drive enclosures. Otherwise, built-in 3.5 inch (8.9 cm) bay hard-drive soft mounts, such as those Antec provides, are nice.
A ventilation hole and fan mount arrangement to cool the expansion cards.
Aluminum cases, possibly due as much to being fancy overall, with little vibration-damping plastic and also with fancy loose rattle-prone tool-less connectors rather than screws, tend to be noisy. (Gaps that tend to rattle against each other can be muffled by applying cloth tape or even foam weatherstrip to the mating surfaces.) Steel is quieter. Almost all computer cooling is done by fans, not conduction through the case, so a steel case will keep cool just as well.
""Acoustic damping foam"" can absorb (not just seal in) noise from interior components. It is applied to inside surfaces of a computer. If you choose to use it, check that it does not interfere with interior components such as case hard-drive racks or a big heatsink.
One author likes Antec cases with 120mm fans.

, These boards also happen to more often have features making them better for other reasons, too.


Look for a motherboard with multiple-GPU technology, such as AMD ""Crossfire"" or nVidia ""SLI"", compatible with your type of video card if you think you might want to upgrade.SLI compatibility is more restricted.It's often easiest to mount the CPU cooler before installing the motherboard in the case. If the cooler does not clip to the CPU socket or a bracket around it as most do but uses screws extending through the motherboard (tighten only firmly, don't break something), you must have access to the back of the motherboard to mount it.

, Look for standard 120mm fan compatibility. As with a case, a bundled fan may be quiet enough, but don't count on it. A ""tower"" style heatsink is generally quietest; check that the case will be wide enough to accommodate it hanging off the motherboard. Generally avoid all-copper heatsinks because they cool only very slightly better than copper-and-aluminum ones, and are so heavy they risk damaging the motherboard when the computer is moved.


The CPU cooler will need a mount compatible with your particular kind of CPU. Many are compatible with many kinds of CPUs, but check.
A CPU cooler's fins are often thin metal with sharp edges. Take care not to drag fingers against them or hold them by the edges of only a few fins. It would be best to hold the cooler with a glove or small towel if force, such as pressure on a clip, is needed to mount it (be careful not to break anything). CPU coolers with only a few thin, sharp fins placed a significant distance apart could increase the risk of cuts.
Be sure to remove any plastic film from over the CPU and heatsink, and Apply Thermal Paste, also known as thermal compound, when installing a heatsink. Modern CPUs generally have a large metal protective ""heat spreader"" permanently installed. The recommended small blob of thermal paste in the middle to be spread by pressure is fine; bear in mind that the actual CPU is a small chip under the middle of the plate so perfect edge-to-edge coverage is unneeded, and trying to achieve it by spreading the compound risks more-problematic bubbles. If the heatsink base has crevices in it, such as those around heat pipes that touch the CPU directly, fill them with thermal compound (scrape it in with an unneeded plastic card). The thermal paste that comes with a cooler is generally fine, but check reviews if you like.

One author likes Arctic Alumina. It's no more effective than other good thermal pastes, but it's relatively easy to clean up and non-conductive so an errant bit won't cause problems.


The cooler supplied very cheaply by the CPU manufacturer would be effective, but they are, with some exceptions, loud (check reviews of the kind supplied with your specific model of CPU). Generally, you won't want to use it. You may as well not try it because the single-use thermal pad (rather than thermal paste) it comes with is hard to clean off when you remove the cooler.
One author likes the Sunbeam Core-Contact Freezer. It's effective, cheap, and not very heavy, but the mounting clip requires considerable pressure. The bundled fan is fairly quiet; the cooler is a bargain even if another fan is used.
Some heatsinks such as Thermal rights are available with matching ducts to exhaust hot air directly. You'll need a case fan hole straight behind the heatsink. These can be inconvenient to install.

, Bigger, slower fans are available, but not in many varieties. Ball bearings are very durable but noisy. Sleeve bearings are less durable, particularly in high-temperature environments (which should not be a problem if the case is ventilated by multiple 120mm fans). Fluid bearings (FDB) are quiet and durable but cost a little more. Some fans have special blade designs to reduce turbulence noise, but that isn't much of a problem with slow fans anyway. Retail stores tend to have high markups on fans and other small accessories.


One author likes the Scythe S-Flex 800rpm, which has fluid bearings.
Check the CPU temperature with monitoring software to make sure it isn't too high. 60 degrees Centigrade or below under sustained load is fine (extreme cooling isn't necessary except for overclocking).

, Use soft mounts instead of screws. Arrange the fans so air flows through the case in an orderly manner. For instance, in at the lower front and by the expansion cards, through the CPU cooler, and out the back. There should be a case exhaust fan, but air can also be pushed out by the power supply fan, a duct from the CPU cooler, and a video card integrated heatsink.

, Multiple video cards would generally be better than dual-GPU cards, because less air must be forced through the little heatsinks to cool them. Look for a relatively inexpensive current card that has the same kind of cooler the manufacturer supplies on its most powerful card. These will generally be almost as capable as, but significantly less power-hungry and noisy than, the best if they have almost as many parallel processing units running at a slightly lower speed and voltage.


Non-standard dual-slot heatsinks are often not as quietly effective as the chip manufacturer's reference heatsink, which is generally the most common kind. But they are usually better than single-slot coolers.
Unlike CPUs, video cards are not designed for a variety of coolers. Aftermarket coolers generally occupy multiple slots and are difficult and somewhat risky to install.
If you use multiple video cards, try to space them out. Try to avoid covering one's air intake with an adjacent card.

, A solid-state driveis extremely fast, cool-running, and completely silent, but expensive in large capacities. If you need a lot of storage, 5400 RPM or slightly faster hard driveswith fluid bearings (which most of them have now) are best. They are cheap, nearly silent, and only a little slower than the common faster 7200 RPM drives. A more complicated approach would be to use the 5400 RPM drives for data storage, and the SSD for programs, where its fast random access is particularly advantageous.


You can reduce the latency of a slower-spinning hard drive with ""short-stroking"" to reduce seek time at the expense of capacity. You can do this with a special drive-configuration program,or simply by making only a single small partition of perhaps 25% of the drive's capacity.This partition should be at the ""beginning"" of the drive, customarily mapped to the higher-linear-speed, higher-data-rate outer tracks. (A very small partition is wasteful because rotational latency is constant at a given RPM.)
Like fans, hard drives should be soft-mounted to keep them from transferring vibration to the case. The kind of soft mount for a hard drive is different from the kind for a fan. Some Antec cases come with soft mounts. They may also come with ""suspension"" mounts, but moving the computer with those in place risks serious damage.
Do not wrap hard drives in insulating material. The best way to quiet them is a padded enclosure with special heat-conducting parts. One author likes the ""Smart Drive"" from Grow Up Japan.

, Power supplies vary in capacity, efficiency (which affects quietness because waste energy becomes heat which needs to be removed by airflow), noise, and consistency of power output. They include fans and heatsinks, which are not practical to change. Look for a well-recognized brand name or favorable reviews specific to the particular model, a 120mm or larger fan, sufficient connectors for all your components (extras can be added for items that consume little power, like CD drives), and good ratings for quietness (""silent"" in the description means little). As a rule of thumb, choose one with a capacity rating of about twice the total maximum power consumption of the major system components (CPU and video cards) for long life and quiet operation, and one with ""80 Plus"" efficiency certification.


""80 Plus"" bronze, silver, gold, and platinum are successively higher levels of efficiency certification.Fanless power supplies are not great for high-power computers. They would need cooling from external fans, which would be a less efficient, louder use of air flow.
Power supplies with ""modular"" cables can give a neater appearance, but add a set of power-supply-to-cable connections to potentially have problems. If your concern is simply quietness, just neatly bundle excess cables to reduce airflow obstructions.
One author likes Antec (economical but good), Enermax (high capacity) and Nexus (super quiet) power supplies.

Your computer may support other sizes, including 60 mm or 140 mm. If you're unsure, remove one of the fans that is currently installed and take it to your local computer retailer and ask about its size or measure it yourself.


Most modern cases use 120 mm fans.
If you are adding a new fan instead of replacing a burnt out one, you will need to look at how the fans interact with each other and whether they will circulate air over the components they are needed for, which is beyond the scope of this article. Items like video cards and processors tend to require individual cooling fans designed to draw air over heat exchangers or heat sinks attached to the individual devices, and some older video cards have fans attached to the device board.;
, Find empty spots where fans can be installed. There are typically fan spots on the back, side, top and front of the tower. Each case has its own fan configuration and maximum number of fans.

, If your case supports multiple sizes of fans, larger fans will almost always be better than smaller ones. 120 mm fans are significantly quieter and also move much more air per spin, making them much more efficient.

, Read spec sheets and reviews to compare different fans. Look for lower volume levels and high reliability. Fans are usually pretty inexpensive, and you may be able to get a good deal if you buy a pack of four. Some of the more popular manufacturers include:


Cooler Master
Evercool
Deep Cool
Corsair
Thermaltake

, If you want to add a little flair to your case, you can use LED fans. These will light up your case with different colors, but are a little more expensive.

, If you're planning to connect the fan(s) to the power supply, open your PC's case and inspect the power cables coming from it to determine what kind of power connector your fan(s) should have. The most common connectors are molex, 3-pin, and 4-pin. Some power supplies will have multiple kinds of connectors which enables you to buy any kind of fan, but do this to be sure. If want to be able to control the fan's speed, you should connect the fan to your motherboard (unless you have a special feature of your PC that allows you to control the speed without the motherboard). Most motherboards provide 3 and/or 4 pin connectors for fans., This step is self-explanatory., Hold the power button for at least ten seconds., You will need to remove the side panel of your computer opposite of the motherboard in order to access the inside. Remove any screws securing the side panel to the rest of your computer's case and pry it off. Some cases have side panels that swing.


The side panel opposite of the motherboard is usually on the left side.
There are dozens of panel configurations, some using the described screws, some with flipback latches, and others with latches you depress to unlock a panel.

, Always ground yourself before working inside of a computer. Electrostatic discharge can seriously damage components. You can use an electrostatic wrist strap, or you can ground yourself by touching a metal object.


Continue to ground yourself while working on the computer to release any charge that has built up.

, There are multiple vents in the case that can support fan installation. You can find the vents on the back, front, side, and top of the computer, depending on the case.

, They may be scattered around, and there may only be a couple. Fan connectors are typically labeled CHA_FAN# or SYS_FAN#. Consult your motherboard's documentation if you are having difficulty finding the connectors.


If you have more fans than connectors, you can use Molex adapters to power your extra fans.

, The fans on your computer don't just blow air on your components. This is not the most efficient way to cool your computer. Instead, fans should move air through the computer, passing fresh air over your components., Fans move air in one direction, indicated by an arrow printed on the top of the fan enclosure. Look at your new case fan. On the top of the enclosure, you should see an arrow. This indicates which way the fan blows. If there is no arrow printed, you can examine the label on the fan mechanism. The air usually flows out of the side with the sticker.

, The wind tunnel is created by intake fans and exhaust fans. Generally you'll want more exhaust fans than intake fans, as this will help create a vacuum inside the case. When there is a vacuum effect, all of the cracks and small openings in your case will also be pulling cool air in.


Rear - The power supply on the back of your computer has one fan that pushes air out the back (exhaust). Set up another fan or two on the rear of the case configured to exhaust air as well.
Front - Install a fan on the front of your computer that sucks air in (intake). You may want to install a second front fan in the hard drive bay (if the case supports it).
Side - Side fans should be set up to exhaust air out the side as well. Most cases support one side fan.
Top - The top fan should be configured as another intake. It may seem natural to set is as an exhaust since the heat will build up at the top of the case, but this will usually lead to too much exhaust and not enough cool air intake.

, Screw the fan in using the four included screws. Make sure that the fan is secure so that it doesn't rattle. Hand-tighten the screws, but don't over-tighten in case you need to remove or replace the fan later.


Make sure that any cables, including the fan's own power cable, cannot get caught in the fan blades. Use cable ties to pull cables out of the way if necessary.
If you are having trouble holding the fan in place while you screw it in, use a few small pieces of masking tape to secure it until the screws are inserted. Make sure not to tape any components or circuitry.

, Connect the fans to the fan connectors on your motherboard. If you have too many fans, or the fan cables will not reach the connectors, use the Molex adapter to connect the fans directly to your power supply.


If fans are plugged directly into the power supply, you will not be able to change the fan speed in the BIOS; they will always run at full speed.

, Make sure to close up your case before testing your fans out. Cases and fans are designed with airflow in mind, and an open case will negate all the airflow benefits. Open cases will cool much less efficiently than a closed case.

, If your fans are connected to the motherboard, you can check that they are working by opening your BIOS. You can also use the BIOS to change the fan speed. Use a program like SpeedFan to monitor your fan speed in Windows.


Any fans plugged directly into your power supply will not be monitored.

, It's all well and good if your fans are spinning properly, but the end goal is to cool the computer's components. Download a temperature monitoring program (SpeedFan takes care of this as well). If your computer is still overheating, you may need to reconfigure your fan locations and directions, or consider more extreme cooling solutions."

Find your current BIOS version.,
Determine your system's origins.,
Backup your existing BIOS first!,
Prepare your system.,
Perform the update.,
Restart the computer.,
Clear existing BIOS settings if recommended.,
Configure the BIOS.",How to Update Your Computer's BIOS," You'll want this information when you visit the manufacturer's website.


Open the System Information app in Windows. For Windows Vista and Windows 7, enter msinfo32 into the search bar (or the Run box in Windows XP), then click System Summary.
Your BIOS version will be displayed under your computer's processor speed. Write down the version number and date (if it appears).;
, This is an important first step to determine where to locate and download the correct BIOS update version.


Did you purchase the computer as a bundled, pre-built system, or was it assembled from purchased components? If it's a bundled system—for example, a Dell—check their website; if the computer was custom assembled, visit the website of the motherboard manufacturer. Look for something like ""Drivers and Downloads.""
Be sure to download the BIOS update for the model you own. If the updater is not written well, it could write over your BIOS with another model's BIOS, and hello, paperweight!
Also be sure to download any Read Me files and other documentation—and then read it! This is not the time to just wing it. There may be important precautions that you should know before updating, and ignoring those could ruin your whole day.

, If using BIOS update software executed from Windows or another operating system, backup the existing BIOS image first. Most BIOS updater have this functionality built-in (e.g., ""Save"" or ""Backup""), and will advise you to perform a backup first. Check your manufacturer's website for information on their recommended way to backup the BIOS.

, The biggest danger with flashing a BIOS comes in the event of power loss during the procedure. You may not be able to control the power company, but you can control how it affects you.


If you are updating a laptop, first make sure the battery is fully charged, and then plug into the wall power so you are not running off the battery. In the event of power failure, your battery will keep things running.
If you are updating a desktop computer, it's best if you are plugged into an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Like the laptop's battery, the UPS will keep everything running, while others are running around in the dark.

, Run the downloaded installer or .exe file for the BIOS updating software.


If the software prompts you for a floppy, use a formatted 1.44MB 3.5"" floppy disk.Insert it into the drive and restart the system to boot from it. Some floppy images contain an ""autoexec.bat"" file to automatically run the BIOS update. Others will just have the update software, the updated BIOS image, and possibly a 'readme' text file containing directions. If there are no directions, but there are at least two files (ie: ""A06_123.bin"" and ""awflash.exe""), follow this example: Enter a command such as ""awflash A06_123.bin"" and press enter. This will execute the update software and specify the A06_123.bin file to flash the BIOS.
Compare the two versions. Most BIOS update software will read the existing BIOS image and determine its version, then compare this to the downloaded BIOS image. If the system's existing BIOS version is older, perform the update. The user interface of BIOS software may vary greatly, yet typically menu buttons or selections such as ""Write"", ""Update"", or ""Confirm"" will perform the BIOS update.

, After the update is completed, many update programs will automatically restart the computer. Some updaters will request your permission to do so while others will warn about this before starting the update. A few will prompt you to power cycle the system yourself. To perform the power cycling procedure manually:


Completely power down the PC by either pressing the power button or initiating the power off sequence from the operating system.
Flip the master power switch on the back of your PC to the off position, if applicable.
Wait a minute.
Flip the master power switch back into the on position, if applicable.
Power up the PC.

, This is not always necessary, depending on what features have changed between the existing version and the updated version. To do so:


When the PC is powering up, immediately initiate execution of the BIOS utility. For most systems, this is done by pressing the Delete key on the keyboard within the first 2 to 10 seconds of turning the computer. Some systems might use different keys such as F2, F10, CTRL, Enter, etc.
If you don't know the keystroke sequence for entering the BIOS utility, watch the monitor to see if the computer displays it.
To clear the BIOS settings, look for an option to ""Restore Defaults"" or ""Load Fail-Safe Defaults"". This may be on the main page of the BIOS utility or on the last page of a tabbed menu. Use the arrow keys to navigate, and follow the on-screen instructions. When complete, save the settings and exit the BIOS utility.

, If you know the settings you want, change them now. If you have never changed BIOS settings before, it is not required to do so. Most PCs will function just fine using the default BIOS settings.

Assess the inside of the panel and see which parts you want to stick the LED strips on.
Once you’ve chosen the part, get some tissue paper and wet it with alcohol.
Rub the surfaces of the inside panel to remove dust, oil or any other substances that will prevent a great stick.;
,


Measure out and cut the strips to size. Most strips allow you to cut only every after 3 LEDs, so keep that in mind.
Peel the back of the strips and lay them into the panel.

,


Measure and cut the wire to connect the strips in a series. Add a little allowance, as you will have to use wire stripper to take the insulator off the ends of the wires.
Using the soldering gun, connect the wires to the strips. Make sure that the diodes (+/ -) are correctly connected. Most wires are color coded so you are less likely to make the mistake of connecting the positive diodes to the negatives. White or Black is positive and whatever else color should be the negative.
Use the hot glue to to secure the wires to keep them from moving around in the case.

,


The first end of the flexible LED strips should come with a pair of wires to connect power to. If not, then solder two wires to the positive and negative terminals.
Grab your MOLEX connector. The Yellow wire is 12V, and the black is ground. Choose a connector you want to use as the place where you splice the connection. The connector end where the two branches meet is what you plug into the power supply.
Use the wire stripper to split the black and yellow wire.
Solder the black wire (ground) from your MOLEX connector to one wire from your strip assembly.
Do the same for the other wire.
Secure the connections by using some electrical tape.

,


Locate a vacant male connector from your power supply to connect to your strip assembly. When you power your computer on, it should light up.

The color code for the wires is: Red = +5V, Black = Ground (0V), White = -5V, Yellow = +12V, Blue = -12V, Orange = +3.3V, Purple = +5V Standby (not used), Gray = power is on (output), and Green = PS_ON# (turn DC on by shorting to ground).

, Use a Dremel to drill the starting holes followed by a hand reamer to enlarge the holes until they are the right size by test fitting the binding posts. Also, drill holes for the power ON LED and a Power switch (optional).

,,


Connect one of the red wires to the power resistor, all the remaining red wires to the red binding posts;
Connect one of the black wires to the other end of the power resistor, one black wire to the cathode (shorter lead) of the LED, one black wire to the DC-On switch, all the remaining black wires to the black binding post;
Connect the white to the -5V binding post, yellow to the +12V binding post, the blue to the -12V binding post, the gray to a resistor (330 ohm) and attach it to the anode (longer lead) of the LED;


Note that some power supplies may have either a gray or brown wire to represent ""power good""/""power ok"". (Most PSU's have a smaller orange wire that is used for sensing-- 3.3V- and this wire is usually paired at the connector to another orange wire. Make sure this wire is connected to the other orange wires, otherwise your lab power supply won't stay on.) This wire should be connected to either an orange wire (+3.3V) or a red wire (+5V) for the power supply to function. When in doubt, try the lower voltage first (+3.3V). If a power supply is non ATX or AT compliant, it may have its own color scheme. If yours looks different that the pictures shown here, make sure you reference the position of the wires attached to the AT/ATX connector rather than the colors.
Connect the green wire to the other terminal on the switch.
Make sure that the soldered ends are insulated in heat shrink tubing.
Organize the wires with an electrical tape or zip-ties.

, Inspect for bare wire, and cover it to prevent a short circuit. Put a drop of super-glue to stick the LED to its hole. Put the cover back on.

, Flip the main cutoff switch on the PSU if there is one. Check to see if the LED light comes on. If it has not, then power up by flipping the switch you placed on the front. Plug in a 12V bulb into the different sockets to see if the PSU works, also check with a digital voltmeter. Make sure you do not short any wires out. It should look good and work like a charm!

When buying, some people recommend a general rule of thumb that the second best CPU (or mother board, video card, etc.) is often the best in cost/performance, though this isn't a hard and fast rule. For a more objective comparison, look up benchmarks for the processor such as PassMark's list of high end processors and sort by ""price performance"".;
, Take note of the processor socket (ex: LGA 1150, LGA 1151, or AM3+), the memory module type (ex: 240-pin) and the RAM frequency (ex: 1066 MHz) in choosing a motherboard. CPU sockets are only compatible with particular CPUs. Some motherboards come with features such as HDMI, so look for a motherboard with these features if desired. There are different kinds of motherboards: Mini ITX, Micro ATX, ATX.


Beware of high frequency RAM. While it may at first seem that any computer part which works harder or faster must certainly be better, this is not always the case. The benefits of high frequency RAM are inconsistent and it is known to have a high failure rate.You should note the number of pins for your memory module only because of how it will connect to your motherboard. More pins does not equate with better performance. The same can be said of the processor socket: different types do not necessarily indicate performance.

, Having more RAM, or desktop memory, will offer smoother performance and shorter loading times. Choose memory that is within your budget from a known manufacturer like Corsair, Kingston, etc. There are many different memory manufacturers, but a select few make quality memory.


You will want to choose the highest clock speed (the rating in MHz) and the lowest timings as possible (displayed in #-#-#-#) -- the performance of your memory relies greatly on them.
You will want to buy enough memory to run your applications. Understand that while your games may say that 2GB is enough, what it really means is that it’s enough to run the game badly. If you want games to run smooth, generally you should overshoot the requirement. At the same time, more RAM won't always mean better performance. It really depends on what types of programs you want to run such as rendering programs and how many programs you are running at once. For example, if you are just running a couple of light to programs such as Roblox, you won't need more than 4GB for it to run smoothly. But if you are playing the newest triple A titles, try to get at least 16GB of RAM for it to run decently.
32-bit CPUs and Operating Systems can only support up to 3.5 GB of RAM; 64-bit CPUs and Operating Systems can support much more, up to many terabytes in theory. The practical limit to how much RAM you can install is a function of how many DRAM slots your motherboard has (most have either 2 or 4), and the maximum capacity of DRAM modules available to you. The specifications of the chipset on the motherboard may also state a limit, for example 32 GB or 64 GB.
Since big DRAM modules are expensive, the most important question to ask is, ""how much DRAM can my programs actually use?"" Very few consumer application programs can actually make use of more than 1 or 2 GB of DRAM even if you have more than that installed.
A good strategy for determining your RAM usage is to start off with a smaller amount such as 8 GB of RAM and upgrade as needed. You can always use task manager to see how much RAM is being used by each program. Remember that additional RAM creates a substantial amount of extra heat and will cause more power usage.
If you are building a 64 bit system, check the price of the DRAM modules that your motherboard requires, in 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB sizes. If the 8GB modules are the least expensive per GBB, buy one to start with. For a gaming system, you want to research the specs on the games you will be installing, and see how much DRAM these games can actually use, then buy the next larger size. For example, if a game says it wants 4GB of DRAM, buy a single 8GB DRAM. On a 2-slot motherboard, that gives you more than enough memory for the apps you are running today, with some room for future games with higher performance. And, it leaves you a second slot for future expansion if you ever need more; on a 4-slot board, that's 3 slots still open for future expansion. As of late 2015, 8GBB DDR3 RAM modules were only a couple dollars more than 4GB modules, so there was absolutely no reason to buy any DRAM smaller than an 8GB.

, This may be one of the most important, yet toughest decisions to make because there are so many different video cards on the market. Because there are so many, the best way to find your card is to look for reviews on cards within your budget. Use review websites such as Tom's Hardware to compare performance between video cards.


There have been some confusion on the NVIDIA cards, which are recommended by gamers. A higher number in the card name does not mean it is better. The first number is the card series, while the second and sometimes third indicate performance level.
If you really want to pump up the game, and you have a motherboard that can support it, get 2 identical cards from the same manufacturer and run them in SLI (Nvidia), or Crossfire (AMD) mode. This is generally a bad idea, however, unless you already have a top of the line card, because it's cheaper and more efficient to get a single better graphics card. However, in some cases, it may be cheaper to get 2 GTX 660s and run them in SLI.

, Games, audio, and videos require plenty of space to store the large files associated with media such as these. Read reviews on hard drives and choose the best for the price.


Faster hard drives will only affect game loading times, and even then not by much. Focus mainly on ensuring that you have enough storage space and do not prioritize hard drive speed.
SATA cards are currently the best choice because their small cables allow for better airflow and transfer speeds than older PATA cables. Look into SATA 3, SATA 6...higher is faster.
Having an SSD (Solid State Drive) impacts gaming performance hugely. They have much faster read and write times, allowing for much faster launch times and performance. However, as these storage devices are expensive, it makes sense to get both a hard drive and a SSD. Keep all your games and if you have enough room, your OS on your SSD and everything else on your hard drive.

, Check the power of the power supply. Power supplies come with either 20-pin or 24-pin connectors. Get the same number of pins as your motherboard has so that it will connect. Be sure that it meets all the recommended power requirements for your parts, such as the graphics card.


It is important to remember that most power supplies that come with cases are of low quality. Consider replacing it with one that is more powerful and more efficient as soon as possible.
350 Watts is the minimum you should expect for modern computers. More powerful components such as high-end video cards may require 500 Watts or more.
There are different standards. 80+ Bronze, 80+ Silver, 80+ Gold, 80+ Platinum. The difference is power efficiency and stability, platinum is more efficient than bronze.

, Never overlook the importance of your case. After all, it houses all the expensive parts that run your computer. Here you will want to focus on cooling.


Some cases use 80mm, others use 120mm fans, and some are built for both. Fans come in all sizes. Generally, larger fans produce less noise and push more air through your case. More powerful components will require more cooling, so be thoughtful of which case you purchase.
If possible, you will want to have equal pressure in your case. Usually, you will want to have back fans blowing out, front fans sucking in, top fans blowing out, bottom fans sucking in, side fans sucking in.
A mid-tower case is standard, but a full-tower case may be necessary if you have a high number of peripherals, such as CD-ROM drives and hard drives.

, With all the above components purchased, you will want an operating system which can make use of the system you have put together. When it has installed, check online for driver updates.


Windows tends to be the best operating system for gaming, though you may initially want to choose a newer version of Windows like 10 or 8.1, since these have improved performance.
Linux-based operating systems are growing and may have limited game support. Most distributions are free and lightweight, and are a great option if you have a lower-end computer or the games you want to play have a Linux version available. Many Windows games are even perfectly playable using Wine (some games may have reduced performance or bugs when run under Wine).

, Generally, with high-end computers, case fans don't cut it. Generally, liquid cooling is the best.

, This is very important. You don't want to damage your CPU. You can remove static by simply touching the outside of your computer case, or by getting things like anti-static hand pads or anti-static ""watches"" for some extra peace of mind.

, Putting together a computer is more complex than it sounds. Make sure you do it correctly or it will not run.

, A high quality gaming PC will usually be more powerful than a gaming console. You may enjoy connecting your PC to your high def TV to get the big screen experience with the powerful PC performance. At the same time, many veteran PC gamers prefer a monitor over a TV screen. There are many companies offering monitors such as BenQ or ASUS. A good standard resolution is 1920x1080 or for high end computers, 4K displays. As a tip, remember that some connectors support higher resolutions than others.

, PC gaming controls can be hard to learn and use for people who are more familiar with console gaming. However, you can easily connect a console controller to a PC and play your game as normal.

Buy HDMI cables when you need a top quality signal.,
Use HDMI technology to accommodate copper cables at lengths up to 50 feet (15 meters) without requiring a repeater or an amplifier.

,
Consider HDMI cables to support all existing formats of audio and video, including 720p, 1080i, 1080p (also 2160p, 4K or Ultra HD) and up to 60Hz.",How to Buy HDMI Cables1,"


HDMI cables send an uncompressed signal, meaning you don’t lose any quality as it travels through the line. When signals go through the compression/decompression process, the signal can degrade. However, that does not happen with HDMI cables.;
,, HDMI cables are so advanced that there’s additional bandwidth already built into the cable for future devices that may demand more space.

, Do you want to sleeve a cable by splicing it, removing pins from connectors, or in place over the existing connectors? Splicing is a good option if you plan to change the length of the cable at the same time, while removing pins from connectors (to avoid forcing the sleeving over connectors) is the cleanest approach. Some connectors may be small enough to sleeve a cable in place.

, There are several factors to take into consideration when choosing your sleeving size.


The size of your wire will determine how the sleeving will look over it (3/4"" sleeving over 1/8"" wire would look terrible).
The size of your connectors will also have a bearing on the sleeving size. If you have a 3/4"" connector, and 1/8"" wire, you might want to consider removing the connector so you can use a more appropriately sized sleeve.
Consider the appearance, even if connector size isn't a factor. For example, if you have a 1/4"" cable/wire, using 1/8"" sleeving may not be appropriate. Even though typical 1/8"" sleeving will expand to 1/4"", the sleeving will be too transparent for your wire. Instead, consider using 1/4"" sleeving in this case.
The fray resistant sleeve mentioned below also provides the end user with a less transparent product because of the tight-weave construction.

, As sleeving expands around cables its length shortens, so be sure to match the length of the sleeving while on the cable itself. Leave approximately 1/4"" to 1"" (3 to 12mm) of cable exposed at each end. This exposed section will help the heat-shrink tubing to grip both the cable and the sleeving. If applicable, it should also provide enough slack to reinsert pins into their connectors. As your sleeving skills improve, you'll be able to guess the correct length to cut.

, To avoid fraying and un-weaving, use a heat source, such as a lighter, to singe both ends. Most sleeving cut from a manufacturer or distributor will already be singed at the ends. Whenever you make a cut into the sleeving, singe the ends on both sides of the cut.
The first photo shows frayed edges of sleeving that has not been singed or treated in any way. The second photo shows sleeving with a singed end to keep it from fraying.
Note: Be careful when using a lighter. Too much heat can cause discoloration of the sleeving (which probably won't matter if you're putting heat shrink over it). More importantly, the sleeving could melt too much, causing bumps to form on the sleeving edge. This will show up through the heat shrink as surface blemishes. The best way to get fray resistant ends is to use a hot-knife cutter, or a soldering gun with a blade attachment. There are also several types of fray resistant braids on the market that are naturally fray resistant due to the braiding process during manufacturing.

, Put the cut sleeving on the cable, pushing it up the cable in a fashion of movement similar to an inchworm.


Squeeze down to hold one side of the sleeving in place with your first hand.
Use your other hand to push the sleeving together.
Release the grip of your first hand.
Repeat until sleeving has been completely installed.

, You'll need two pieces of approximately 1/4"" to 1"" (3 to 12mm) long to cover the ends of the sleeving. The tubing should be large enough in diameter to clear the sleeving. Slip both of them over the cable and sleeving, one at a time. Push them all the way to the end of the cable that doesn't have pins, or the end that will be completed last.

, If your sleeving is long and the other side of your cable attached to something, pull back sleeving to give yourself room to work. Use wire ties (twisting variety) or a pair of locking pliers to hold back sleeving.

,



Prepare cable ends before rejoining the wires. Strip the wire insulation off of each end, then twist stranded wires together to avoid separation. Cut two pieces of heat-shrink tubing to cover each soon-to-be reconnected wire. The heat-shrink tubing should be as long as the stripped portion of wire strands, plus 1/4"" (3mm), and should be large enough in diameter to clear the wires once twisted together. Slide the heat-shrink tubing over each wire as shown in the photo.

Connect the wires by twisting the stripped portion of each wire's ends together. For solid wires (non-stranded), twist them together with a pair of small, needle-nose pliers.

Secure and insulate connections. Move the two pieces of heat-shrink tubing to cover the stripped sections of wire that are twisted together. Make sure there is enough tubing to cover all exposed wire as well as overlap at each end. If not, undo the wire connection and re-twist it to make it shorter. Use your heat source to shrink (activate) the tubing until it fits snugly over the connections.

, Note: if you're sleeving a cable with removed pins, now is the time to reinsert the pins into their connectors. Remove wire twist or locking pliers and release sleeving, allowing it to extend over the entire cable. If the sleeving is now too long, use a pair of diamond edge cutters to snip away the excess sleeving. Remember to leave at least 1/4"" (3mm) of cable exposed for heat-shrink tubing.
The first photo shows sleeving that was cut too long for the cable. The second photo shows the sleeving after it has been cut down in size. If you've correctly estimated the length of your sleeving ahead of time, you won't need to make these adjustments.

, Hold the end of the sleeving, then pull on the other end to expand the sleeving as much as possible. If you selected the right sized sleeving, it should provide a snug fit around the cable. For larger cables, or if desired, attach a nylon wire tie (zip tie) over each end of the sleeving. This will ensure the sleeving does not move unless forced.

, Position the two heat-shrink tubing pieces, then activate them with your heat source. Be sure to keep the sleeving taut around the cable during this step. Repeat all of these steps for each cable you want to sleeve.

Start by mounting your television and television mount to the wall.,
Cut two holes in the drywall, one near the television and one near the A/V receiver or other audio video equipment.,
Fish wires from the top to the bottom (never bottom to top) that are rated for in-wall use.,
Install some sort of sleeve around the hole so as to give it a finished look.,

Mount your television and reconnect all cables.",How to Conceal Wiring Behind Drywall," After doing so you will be able to remove the television and leave the mount on the wall. This will allow you to select a good spot to make a hole in the wall.;
, Make sure to use a stud finder to determine the position of the hole will be between two studs (with at least 1"" of clearance on each side of the hole). After a good position is determined, make the hole using a drywall saw or reciprocating saw., It is easy to find RCA, HDMI, and speaker wire that is rated for in-wall use but more challenging to find power (IEC) cables for in-wall use., Some wall plates have an opening with brushes in it so as to minimize the sight of the wires. You can also have wall plates custom-made per the job, or see if an installation company can get you a deal on custom-made plates because of their wholesale prices., Your television should appear as if it was wireless with no unsightly cables or wires hanging down to the receiver."

Determine what length you will need by measuring the distance from component to component.,
Find the HDMI cable you need for the length you need to run.,
Keep in mind that there are several versions of HDMI.,
Skip the high priced retailer.,
Expect to pay no more than $10 for a standard six-foot HDMI cable.

,
Purchase an HDMI cable adaptor to connect your HDMI cables to your existing DVI equipped products.",How to Buy HDMI Cables2," Keep in mind if you go too short and need to move a component farther away later on, you'll have to buy another cable.


Unlike cat cable, HDMI cable isn’t easily changed if you need a longer or shorter length. Cat cabling allows you to cut the cable at the appropriate length and add the appropriate end, if you have the right tools. However, HDMI cable does not allow you to do that.
Allow for a little slack. If you ever need to pull a component out, you want there to be enough cable to allow you to do that. Otherwise, you’ll have to disconnect your HDMI cable every time you pull out your component.

, Standard HDMI cabling can transmit a 1080i signal for at least 49 feet (15 meters). A high-speed HDMI cable transmits a 1080p signal for at least 25 feet (7.5 meters).

, The later the version, the more information it can carry. Go for version 1.3 or later; it will carry the full bandwidth of picture and sound information for Blu-Ray.

, Promises of faster speeds and higher quality audio and video don’t hold much water when you compare various qualities of HDMI cables. There’s no reason to buy high quality HDMI cables from your local electronics store when you can buy virtually the same thing through discount stores or online retailers for much less.


By going online, you have better chances of finding and buying cheaper cables. You will not really gain anything in picture or sound quality by buying a more expensive cable. A reputable home theater magazine did some testing, and that is their conclusion. The only difference you will see is build quality. So it might be worth spending a little more if you will be frequently unplugging and plugging the cable in. Otherwise, save your cash.

,,


Check the types of inputs and outputs available on your components. Make sure they’re compatible with HDMI. If not, you will require an HDMI adaptor.

If you have a basic home theater system and your speakers are fairly close to your receiver, you will be fine with standard speaker cables. However, better wiring has higher quality metals that actually increase conductivity, which can lead to a higher quality of sound.;
,


If you have high quality speakers, you’ll likely hear a noticeable difference between high end and low-end speaker cables. However, if you don’t hear enough of a difference to warrant the price difference, simply return the higher priced cables.
Make sure the store where you purchase your speaker cables has a good return policy if you plan to run a test at home.

Make sure your amplifier can be bridged.,
Know the layout of your equipment.,
Connect the amplifier to one speaker.",How to Bridge an Amplifier1," This should be indicated on the documentation pamphlets that came with the amplifier, or the amplifier itself. If the amplifier is used, or lacks documentation, go online and check for the specifications on the manufacturer's website.


Bridging an amplifier cuts the resistance load (measured in ohms) in half, which can cause it to overheat. Be sure to check your manual (or the manufacturer’s website) to see if once connected to a speaker, whether or not your amplifier can function at half the ohms it currently uses.
Most amplifiers have a small diagram near the channels indicating the terminals you would use to bridge it. If your amplifier does not claim to be able to bridge, don't try to bridge it. It may already be bridged internally, and you could cause damage to your amplifier.
Be aware of the fact that if your amplifier is a stereo amplifier (amplifying both left and right), bridging it would cause it to become a mono amplifier (amplifying from one; either the left or right).;
, On your two-channel amp, you should see 4 terminals: a positive (+) and a negative (-) for channel 1, and a positive (+) and a negative (-) for channel 2. Each terminal will be labeled as follows:


Channel 1

""A"" (positive)
""B"" (negative)


Channel 2

""C"" (positive)
""D"" (negative)



,

From the wires coming out of the speaker, connect the positive speaker lead to terminal A (the positive for channel 1) and connect the negative speaker lead to terminal D (the negative for channel 2). Connect these wires by unscrewing the screw in that terminal, placing the wire in between the top and bottom portions of the terminal, and then screw the screw down tightly to secure the wire.

The wires coming from the speaker are going to be insulated with a plastic coating. You will need to strip off a small portion of the wire insulation (less than 1 inch) using a pair of wire strippers in order to secure it to the terminals.What this connection does is it combines the power from the two separate channels, doubling your power output."

Know that commonly used surge protection devices include the point-of-use surge protection device and the service entrance protection device.,
Choose the service entrance surge protection device if you want to provide protection at the initial point of entry, usually outside of your home, generally located where the electrical panel or electric meter is situated.,
Select the point-of-use surge protection power strips if you are looking for portability and only need to protect a few electrical devices within your home.,
Consider getting both service entrance surge protection devices and the point-of-use surge protection power strips if you want a high level of protection.,
Realize that many surge protectors provide a warranty from the manufacturer for your connected equipment if it becomes damaged during a power surge.,
Choose a surge protection device based upon your personal needs.,
Visit your local hardware store or large retail chain store that specializes in products for the home.",How to Choose a Surge Protector," The point-of-use surge protection devices are available as plug-in type power strips as well as those that can be installed in the same way as a regular electrical outlet. Each type offers unique features for protection.;
, This type of surge protector will require that you have surge protection devices for incoming electrical power as well as for your telephone and cable television lines for full protection.

, This type allows you to plug multiple electrical appliances into 1 surge protector power strip. Make sure that you are not purchasing an extension cord, which is somewhat similar in appearance, as they do not provide protection from power surges.


Realize that the point-of-use surge protection devices are also available to be individually installed as a regular electrical outlet for items such as microwave ovens, air conditioners and dryers, all of which consume a high amount of electricity when in use. This type of surge protector must be installed by a professional electrician.

, If you have expensive electrical equipment within your home or run a business out of your home and want the added protection then think about dual protection and acquiring both types of surge protection devices.


Know that the service entrance surge protection device will cover your home's complete electrical system and provide protection by reducing the power surge level before it reaches the point-of-use surge protection device that protects individual appliances and devices inside your home.

, Read the guarantees carefully before you select and purchase a surge protector regardless of the type of unit.

, Consider what electrical appliances will be hooked up to the surge protector. Surge protectors are available to provide varying levels of protection.

Run a string from your amplifier to your speaker locations to determine how much speaker wire you need.,
Consider the gauge of speaker wire required for the job.,
Identify the type of connector required for your speakers.",How to Buy Speaker Cables2,"


Allow a little extra slack in your speaker wire in case you measure wrong or if you ever need to move your speakers in the future.
If you plan to run your speaker wire behind your walls or ceiling, safety code requires you to use CL2 or CL3 UL-rated speaker wire. The Underwriters Laboratory (UL) examines the heat generated from the wire, how quickly the speaker wire might catch fire when exposed to a flame and how prone the wire is to damage if it encounters external stresses to set this rating.
If you plan to run speaker wire outdoors, you’ll need speaker wire that’s rated for direct burial.

, The AWG (American Wire Gauge) number identifies the gauge, or the thickness, of a speaker wire.


Use 16 gauge if you need fewer than 80 feet (24 meters) of speaker wire.
Use 14 gauge if you need 80 feet to 200 feet (61 meters) of speaker wire.
Use 12 gauge if you need more than 200 feet of speaker wire.

,


You might connect with bare wires, pin connectors, banana plugs, spade connectors or dual banana plugs.
Some high-end brands of speakers, like Bose, do not have standard connectors for speaker wire or audio cables. Contact the company to find speaker wire or audio cabling that’s compatible with those speakers.

,, Unlike the cheap plastic cord holders that break or are hard to get open, or like the tape gives way when you have it full of wires, these clips will be durable for a very long time and won't harm your cords.

Figure out what kind of connection you have.,
Run a speed test.,
Call your Internet provider if all else fails.",How to Calculate Bandwidth," Do you have a broadband connection? DSL? Dial-up? Each of these offers different speeds. A broadband connection usually has a 512 kilobytes/second speed or more (to give an idea of how fast that is, the average web page is about 70 kilobytes and an average song is about 3,000 kilobytes, or 3 megabytes).;
, There are several ways to do this:


Manually download a file from an email or from a trusted website. Watch the transfer speed and average the highest and lowest rates to find your average actual bandwidth.
Run an automated speed test using a site that pings (sends and receives packets of data) servers located in your country-preferably in your region. This is the easiest way to figure out your bandwidth as it is entirely automated. There is a variety of trusted websites that tell you how to calculate bandwidth, but one of the easiest is provided by CNET (the link is provided below). Simply click on your location and it does the rest for you.

, They will be able to provide all information you need about your Internet line, usage, download rates and potential caps.

If you see that your download speed is significantly faster than files are actually downloading, the problem most likely isn't with your Internet.
If your download speed is much slower than your Internet package and router allow for, you need to minimize the number of devices connected to the Internet.;
, The more devices you have on your network, the slower your Internet will be. If you can disable consoles, phones, televisions, tablets, and alternate computers, your own computer's downloads will be faster., When you're downloading a big (or a small) file, it helps to turn off apps that are taking up your bandwidth.


For example, you'd close BitTorrent if it was running in the background while you attempted to download a Windows update.

, Netflix, Hulu, and even YouTube can be a serious drain on your download speed. Even if it's only by a marginal amount, disabling these services will boost your download speeds.

You should also close any non-essential browser windows or tabs.

, If your computer isn't using an Ethernet connection, connect it to your router with an Ethernet cable and see if your downloads increase in speed.

If your downloads do increase in speed, your wireless connection to the router is poor. Try staying closer to the router or purchasing a stronger router.
If the download speed doesn't increase, the problem is either with the router or your computer.
You can reset your router's cache by unplugging both the router and the modem, waiting for a minute or so, and then plugging everything back in.

, As noble as it may be to give back to your favorite torrenting community by uploading, doing so while downloading will all but kill your download speeds. Wait to seed until all of your downloads have completed and you're no longer using the Internet (e.g., when you're at work or asleep)., This action disguises what you're downloading so that your ISP doesn't selectively throttle it. (ISPs will throttle if they know a BitTorrent client is doing a lot of downloading.) To do this:


Click Options in the BitTorrent or uTorrent window.
Click Preferences.
Click BitTorrent.
Click the ""Outgoing"" drop-down box.
Select Forced.
Click Apply, then click OK.

, If your router is more than a couple of years old, it will invariably begin to slow down, and it won't handle downloads as well as a newer one.

When purchasing a new router, make sure you look at models that support the same download speed as your Internet package (or, ideally, higher download speeds).

, Some Internet connections simply aren't able to handle hefty downloads, such as console or computer game installations. Many ISPs have a ""Gamer"" package that prioritizes download speed, though you'll likely have to pay significantly more for this package than you would for a standard Internet package., If you've tried everything else and you can't get your download speeds to increase, you'll need to call your ISP and tell them about the problems you're experiencing.

You may even need to switch your ISP if you live in a remote-enough area.

First thing you need is a JAMMA harness.,
The JAMMA harness has a standardised wiring code as follows:

,

,
Physically push the connector onto your JAMMA board.,
One way to tell which way around the connector goes is to locate the wires for the power supply as these will have different terminals to the wires for the controls; the JAMMA board will usually have the pinouts labelled if there is no key.,
Press the connector firmly onto the board.,
Now gather the wires up into groups, for example: player 1 controls, player 2 controls.,
If your board has a built in test mode then it is a good idea to have it switched on before connecting up the controls.,Once connected, enjoy playing your favourite games.",How to Connect a Jamma Harness," This is a standard edge connector with two rows of 28 pins used on almost all arcade machines.;
,,, The connector and board are usually 'keyed' at the place where pin 7 would be, so that they will only go on one way. Sometimes the connectors are not keyed and it is possible to put it on the wrong way around.

, The cables for the power supply will go to the left of the keyslot on the board.

, If it is a loose fit a blob of hot melt glue will be needed to hold it in place, do not use chewing gum even if it seems to work at first the chewing gum will attract all manner of crawlies that will set up home inside your cabinet and cause trouble down the line.

, A good tip is to temporarily bundle these using elastic bands. Once bundled you can more easily sort out which wire needs to go where. Take your time and use plenty of cable ties to keep it all tidy.

, That way you can actually test that you have the right wire going to the correct control at you wire it up, rather than having to back trace any mistakes later. Don't worry about working with live wires; provided that you have the power supply properly connected and isolated, you are only working with wires carrying a tiny current.

Get some cable clips: First of all you have to get some cable clips.,
Attachment: Then you have to attach them on the back of your desk at a good position.

Give the file an appropriate name.,
Upload the file onto your website server.,
Get the URL where the file is hosted (known as the destination URL).,
Use the following code to create hyperlinked text that will allow people to download the file.

,
Add the download link code within your website HTML where you want it to appear.

,
Test the link by clicking on it through your website and using it to download the file.

",How to Add a Download Link,"


The file name should not be too long since this will make the length of your download link longer.
You should give a very basic idea of what the file is about in the file name so people will not feel suspicious when downloading it. For example, if the file is a video clip of your wedding day then it can be named ""our_wedding"" instead a random set of numbers like ""clip_00798"" that your camera had assigned, which will confuse people who are about to download it.
Do not use any spaces, punctuation marks or capital letters in the file name since these can not be used for the URL link that will be associated with the file.;
, This can be done exactly the same way that you use to upload other webpages to add them to your website. Make sure you upload it as a public file (not a private file) so other people are authorized to download it.

, If someone tries to visit this URL, they will be automatically prompted to download the file that it hosts. Here are some methods that you can use to get the destination URL.


If your website server offers a preview link, right-click on the preview link of your uploaded file and copy the link location.
Add the complete file name (including the file extension) at the end of your domain URL. The destination URL is basically your domain URL with the file name joined at the end.

Close any Internet using programs you do not need, so close any kind of P2P program (unless this is how you're downloading); Internet browser; streaming media; messengers; and games like WOW, America's Army, or any other multiplayer online games.,
Make sure your firewalls are not blocking the program and that the port is open.,
Get a download manager.,
Use/get a faster browser/internet connection(Opera: http://www.opera.com/ or Google Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome )

Set up an account.,
Browse the directory of movies.,
Download the movie.,
Pick your quality.,
Transfer the movie to a phone or tablet.",How to Download a Movie1," The easiest and most worry-free way of downloading movies is to buy them from a reputable source. There are a variety of services that will allow you to purchase movies to view on your computer or other device. Popular services include:


iTunes
Google Play
Amazon Prime
Netflix;
, Different sites will have different prices and titles available. Some services, such as Netflix, charge a monthly fee and allow you to stream whatever you’d like. Others, such as iTunes and Google Play, allow you to purchase individual title, which you can then watch on your computer or phone/tablet.


Consoles offer movie stores as well. Both Microsoft and Sony have digital stores that can be accessed through the console or through the website that allow you to purchase titles to view on the console.

, Before you get started downloading movies and throwing a popcorn-and-B-night extravaganza, you'll need to sign up for an account. Usually this involves nothing more than an email address and username.


Some companies, such as Netflix or Amazon Prime, use a subscription method.
Companies like Apple or CinemaNow (BestBuy) offer pay-as-you-go rental or purchase, and can be significantly more expensive than subscription services—especially if you love movies—but they also tend to offer more current content, and content from premium cable channels such as HBO and Showtime.

, No matter which option you choose, with thousands of movies available on each of these sites, the first thing you'll want to find is a way to narrow your options. Many sites have a genre column, so that you can quickly focus only on topics that interest you.


If you're wanting to locate particular movies or actors, there is typically a search field that you can use to find exactly what you're looking for.

, When you've found a movie to your liking, click the appropriate button. Your movie will download, and depending on the speed of your connection, you could be watching in just a few minutes!


For sites that offer options, such as Apple, you'll see both a Buy and a Rent button. Renting typically makes the movie available for 24 hours, while buying adds it to your permanent collection.
Many sites will have you stream your purchase through the dedicated movie player that they provide. This will mean that you won’t be downloading any files.

, Many services give you the option to choose between SD (Standard Definition) or HD (High Definition). If you are watching on an HD TV, you will see much better picture quality in an HD version, though it may cost more and take longer to download.

, Once you've downloaded a movie, you may be able to transfer it to your phone or tablet. If you are using an Android or iPhone/iPad, buying the movie on your respective service will automatically make it available on your device. If you downloaded an actual copy of the movie, you may need to convert it before you can transfer it to a mobile device.

Find free, legal movies online.",How to Download a Movie2," While many other file sharing protocols exist, BitTorrent is the most effective and popular method for downloading feature-length films. To use this method, you will need to install the client software on your computer.


Most of the best clients are available for free. Some of the most popular clients are uTorrent, Tixati, Vuze, Transmission.
Be aware of the legality. In most jurisdictions, downloading a movie that you are not purchasing legitimately, and don't already own on another format (such as a DVD), is in violation of copyright laws.

, After installing your torrent client software, you can download the torrent file for the movie you wish to watch.


The best way to find the movie you want is to search for the film using torrent search engine. These sites come and go as they are shut down by law enforcement and then reopened with new servers and a different name.
You can also find torrent files using a regular search engine. A torrent file has a "".torrent"" extension, and is actually just a text file telling your torrent client where to download the pieces of the movie.

, Double-click on the torrent file to load it into your torrent client. Depending on your settings, the download should begin automatically. You may need to indicate where you want to save the file.


Once the file has downloaded completely, leave the torrent software open for several hours to allow other users to download the file from you. Some torrent trackers require that you maintain a good ratio of uploaded to downloaded files.

, Once the torrent has finished downloading, your client software will save the actual video file to the location you indicated. Double-click the file to open it in your default media player.


Many movies released through torrents will not work properly with Windows Media Player or QuickTime. In order to play these movies you will need to download an alternative media player, such as VLC or Media Player Classic.
You can safely delete the torrent file itself once the video clip has finished downloading.

, Besides torrent sites, you can acquire public domain movies for free with no legal repercussions. The most comprehensive collection of these films can be found at Archive.org.

Know that most laptop video cards cannot be swapped out.,
Check your laptop user manual to determine if you have a ""PCI"" slot to plug a card into.,
View your Device Manager to get your current video card's information.,
Determine your options for new cards.,
Understand the risks of upgrading your video card by hand.",How to Swap Out Your Laptop’s Video Card1," In order to save space, many laptops come with attached graphics processing units (GPUs) that are hardwired into your processor and motherboard. That means that in order to get a new video card for you computer you'd need to get a new processor, which is expensive enough that a new laptop is often the better buy. You need a PCI slot to upgrade your video card., Go online and search for your user manual, then flip to the ""Specifications"" or ""Product Description"" section. Look for ""Graphics,"" and note what options your computer supports.

, To do so, go to your Control Panel → Hardware and Sound → Device Manager, or search for it in the Windows search bar. Click ""Display Adapters"" and see what comes up. If you see an Intel Chip, or the words ""Integrated Graphics,"" then you have an attached GPU and you cannot swap your video card.


If there are two options, such as Intel graphics and an ATI or nVidia card, you have a discrete graphics card that can be swapped out.
If your only option under ""Display Adapters"" is the same make as the chip in the ""Processors"" section, you have an integrated GPU that cannot be upgraded., In 99% of the cases, you'll need to go straight to the manufacturer for an upgraded card. So HP users should check with HP, Dell with Dell, etc. Unless you have a dedicated, removable video card, you cannot just buy the newest video card online and plug it in. In your user manual there will be a list of acceptable chip upgrades, and you must choose one that works with your computer. Unfortunately, due to speed, software challenges, and even physical size, you will be very limited in the number of video cards you can purchase for your laptop, and your manufacturer will list them all., This is not an easy procedure, and it requires that you take apart almost the entire laptop and put it back together flawlessly. That is, of course, if you can even upgrade it. More often than not, swapping out a video card is not the most cost-effective way to upgrade a laptop, but if you're sure that is what you want to do, there are a couple of precautions you can take:


Take pictures at every stage. This will help you put everything back together.
Consult all the manuals and pictures of your computer before taking it apart. Know specifically what you have to take apart and how to put it back together.
Take anti-static precautions seriously.
Keep a clean, open workspace to prevent losing small screws or mixing up parts."
"
Dismantle the laptop in a clean, dust-free environment to find and replace the video card.,
Thoroughly consult your laptop's user manual for dismantling instructions.,
Turn your computer off for at least 10 minutes before beginning work.,
Remove the back plate and plastic hinges from the laptop.,
Remove the necessary parts, keeping them organized with the screws and attachments needed to reassemble the computer.,
Remove and replace the graphics card once exposed.,
Use compressed air to clean any dust or debris from your computer and parts.,
Replace the parts in the order you took them out.",How to Swap Out Your Laptop’s Video Card2," Every laptop will have a slightly different procedure in order to find and remove the video card, but the same basic principles hold no matter who made your computer. Clean your hands and wipe down the laptop with a static-proof cloth before beginning, making sure you have a clean workspace with minimal dust. You'll need--


A set of Philip's head screwdrivers that fit the small screws on your laptop.
Anti-static wristband to prevent shorting your computer.
Clean cloth and compressed air for cleaning the inside of your laptop.
A soft, clean towel or cloth to place parts on as you're working.
Your new video card., Every laptop is different, but the odds are good that you need to go all the way into the guts of the computer to get your old video card out and the new one in. You want to read through every step 2-3 times before beginning to avoid surprises. HP's popular Pavilion dv series, for example, requires that you remove the battery, optical drive, WLAN, hard drive, keyboard, system board, top cover, and fan in order to adjust the processor and video card. This means you need to know your computer from top to bottom before beginning, as you'll have your work cut out for you.Check out ""How to Take Apart a Laptop"" for generic pictures helping you dismantle most computers.
Make sure you understand how to protect against static electricity with your wristband and grounded (rubber-souled) footwear., Once you're familiar with the task at hand, shut down the computer. Unplug everything and let it sit for 10 minutes to cool down, as computers can get quite hot., More often than not, your first step is going to be stripping away the plastic so that you can get into the guts of the computer. Again, consult your user manual if you have difficulty.


More often than not you simply need a small screwdriver, such as those found in eyeglass repair kits at most pharmacies, to remove the plastic coverings.
Never force or pry out pieces. They plastic parts break easily and should not be difficult to remove with the right technique., This is where every computer is different -- as some computers require massive dismantling and others offer easy access to your switchable video card. Pay close attention to your work, your product manual, and your parts.


Write down the order you took parts out if there is any confusion. This will help you work backward when you need to put the computer back together.
Use cups or bowls to organize screws, keeping a cup of the appropriate connections next to the corresponding part to avoid losing anything., Once you get to the card, simply slide it out of the PCI x16 port (labeled on the switchable motherboard) and slide the new one in. Don't bend, jiggle, or yank on either card -- they should slide in and out relatively easily once you undo the safety latches on the sides. If it does not, check for any forgotten screws or safety latches, use some compressed air to clean out the port, and try again., Compressed air is the easiest, gentlest way to clean out your computer, and the perfect time is when it is dismantled and easily accessed. Clean off all the parts, especially the fan, while they are out. Then gently blast some air inside the computer to give it a good cleaning.

, The installation, in all cases, is the same procedure used to remove the parts in reverse. If you've paid attention and kept yourself organized, you should be able to easily retrace your steps and put the computer back exactly how you found it.


This is why taking pictures as you work is a good idea, allowing you to see exactly how the computer is supposed to look when you're finished."

, It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the wiki by reading a few of its articles before you begin editing. If you are aware of what the rest of the community want and don't want on the wiki, you are less likely to inadvertently upset the owner, admins or other users.

, If you are asked to stop by an admin, do not continue to do it. Wiki owners have the right to do what they want with the pages and it's policies.

,, Do not presume that they are out to prevent you from editing. They are there to facilitate your experience.


Stay calm. Do not chat back or be rude. That soon turns into trolling and will get you blocked. It also resolves nothing.
If there is a misunderstanding, ask calmly for a link to the edit in question and then clarify why you made it. An owner or other admins can judge on the edits you've made to a page.
Remain civil, polite and do not use profanity.

Compare and review several wiki packages that support the features you need.",How to Choose a Wiki Package," This will clarify your thoughts about what you want from your wiki project. It does not need to take you long but should include:

Goals: What you want to achieve with your wiki project.

Audience: Who you expect to visit and contribute to the wiki.

Success: How you will measure the success of your wiki project.
;
,, Use your statement of purpose to work out what features you need in your wiki. Some of the things you will want to consider are:

Cost: There are many free wiki packages, which allow you to set up wikis for no cost at all.

Hosting: Many wiki packages include hosting, even the free ones.

WYSIWYG editing: This may be essential if you are going to have occasional or non-technical contributors.

Domain name: In some wiki package you cannot choose your own domain name such as: www.mychoice.com and you will have to use a sub-domain name, such as: www.mychoice.wikiprovider.com.

Content: Most wikis can handle words and images, but some are much better than others. Other content you might be looking for could include: non-English language content, document attachments, flash, video, audio, mathematical notations, calendars, task lists, maps, RSS input, instant messaging. You are unlikely to find all of these options available on one wiki. You need to decide what you want before you choose your wiki package.

Look and Feel: You may be satisfied with the range of templates a wiki providers has available to give you some control over how your wiki looks. Getting full control over look and feel means having access to the underlying coding, in particular (x)HTML and CSS.

Assigning permissions: You decide who can view, edit, delete or create pages on your wiki by assigning permissions. Different wiki packages assign permissions in very different ways. For example in some wikis, everyone who can edit pages is also allowed to create pages and delete pages. Other wikis separate these permissions and even allow you to assign permissions for individual pages.

Security: Wikis are wonderful because they allow and encourage contributions, however, this poses a challenge to the security of your data. As well as the physical security of your data on the server, there are also threats from: spam, vandalism, no privacy policy of hosting service, collapse of your hosting service and poor data management. If your data is important, you want to be certain it is safe.
Data is also at risk while in transit to and from your server. This may a necessary concern with legal implications, for example online financial transactions or health related applications. Secure data transfer can be provided by many wiki packages, but usually only in paid plans.

Income: If you are planning to make an income from your wiki, you will need one that allows you to place ads on your pages, such as Google Adsense.

Keep your laptop and laptop battery in cool dry temperatures.,
Avoid activity that causes high temperatures.,
Remove the battery from the laptop when powered by the AC Adapter.,
Leave the battery charged halfway when it is not needed.",How to Save Your Laptop Battery2," Keeping your laptop in a well ventilated area while resting a hard surface to increase airflow to the laptop. If working on your laptop in a bed or on a carpet floor, consider using a small tray to place it onto., Your laptop battery may face higher levels of heat due to the laptop if it faces constant high activity on your CPU, graphics card or hard disk activity. Running one high activity program such as a video game or running several low-power programs will help preserve activity on your laptop.


Playing a graphically intensive video game or even watching a movie off of a DVD or Blu-Ray, will demand more power from your CPU, graphics hardware and hard disk and generate more heat.
You may need to consult your laptop’s user manual or manufacturer’s website for information how to remove the battery if you are not able to remove the battery.

, If the laptop will be run primarily using the AC Adapter, a fully charged battery holds onto more energy that will cause it to wear out faster. To remove the battery locate the battery on your laptop and unlatch the clips holding onto the battery. There may be one or two clips that can be slid to their opposite ends to allow you to pull the battery out.


Certain MacBook laptops feature embedded batteries that cannot be removed normally.
If the battery is unable to hold a charge for its intended charge cycle even after charging the battery to it’s maximum level and leaving it off of the AC adapter, the battery may need to be replaced.

, Leave the battery charged between 20-80% if you plan to not use it for more than six months or your laptop will be left on an AC Adapter for power for long periods of time.Allow the battery to fully charge in the laptop. Remove the AC Adapter until the battery discharges its capacity halfway. Power off your laptop and remove the battery.


A battery that is charged halfway uses less energy which allows it a longer lifespan.
If you require the use of your battery, replace it into your laptop with the AC Adapter plugged in and allow it to charge back up to 100%. Once it’s fully charged you may remove the AC Adapter to allow the laptop to run on the battery’s power.

Set Up a BIOS password.,
Use Lol Alarm for alarm security.,
Safeguard your data with Laptop Lock.,
Encrypt your data with Truecrypt.,
Detect motion using your webcam with Yawcam.,
Protect your Mac laptop with iAlertU and Lockdown.,
Track your stolen laptop with Prey.",How to Secure Your New Laptop," This is a trick that a lot of computer owners fail to use. To make breaking into your laptop harder, you can set up a BIOS password. These are harder to crack. Just make sure that you don’t forget your password!

, If you own a Windows laptop and you're worried about potential theft, you can use this security software to set different types of alarms. With LAlarm, you will be able to set a theft alarm, perimeter alarm, battery alarm, inattention alarm and disk alarm. If you're always on the move, you can easily misplace or forget about your laptop but through using these features, you'll find that the laptop calls for your attention (if you set it to) whenever you leave it idle for a specified amount of time. Another great feature that comes with this software is its data destruction and recovery facility. This means that you can set up your system to pretty much self-destruct (well, at least your data), in the event that the laptop is lost or stolen.;
, Whether you have sensitive company data or personal information on your laptop, protecting your PC from possible theft is important. Theft can happen at any time, and typically occurs when you least expect it. You can’t trust that the person who has “found” your laptop will not hack into it or refrain from using the data in a malicious way. Using this software, you can encrypt your data, safeguard it or even delete it, should your laptop be stolen. All you have to do is go to the website and report your laptop stolen; you can choose what you want to have done with the data.

, Just as in the ancient days when the rich would hide their loot in crypts, you can use Truecrypt to build your own virtual crypt. In the digital age, this works through the process of encryption, which will make it so that no one can open any of the files or documents on your computer should they happen to make away with your laptop.

, Your webcam can be used for more than just taking photos, recording videos and having live video chats. It can also be tasked to be a motion detector. Yawcam software can transform your webcam into a motion detector, which can be used to see if and when people are trying to access your laptop. What’s even better is that you can have it automatically email you or have FTP uploads of the images that are captured.

, If you have Macs, use software like iAlertU and Lockdown for Mac to safeguard your data. The potential threat of thieves diminishes because of the alarm features that this software comes with. You will have a feature called iSight, which uses your webcam to detect motion.

, If you really want to find your laptop once it’s lost or stolen, then you need software like Prey. This can be used for mobile devices that are using Windows, Linux, Mac or Android. Other than using GPS to track your device, you can also auto connect to it using a wireless connection. This will send a remote signal using the Internet or SMS, which will then enable you to locate your laptop, lock it down and monitor what the thief is doing on it.

Security.",How to Protect Your Laptop when Traveling," Why are you bringing your laptop, are there other alternatives? Could you do your work in an internet cafe and save your work on a USB or hard drive?;
, Regardless of your method of travel, you will need something to protect the laptop from movement and harm during transport. Use a case that can be carried as you would carry a briefcase, or a shoulder bag that is made well and provides padding and cushion.

, Do not leave your computer unattended in airports, train stations, or bus terminals. If you are traveling by car, be sure to keep it out of sight when you get out of the car for gas, food, and bathroom breaks. Take it into hotels with you overnight. If you are in a crowd keep you bag on your front. If you want to travel light it is best that you leave less valuable bulky luggage in storage.

, In hot countries heat and humidity can cause problems for your laptop.

, In some countries like India it is important you have a voltage stabilizer.

Measure straight down the side of the laptop to the front corner.,
Convert inches to centimeters (if necessary).",How to Measure Your Laptop Computer," Screens are typically measured in inches, though different regions will choose metric over Imperial. If you need to, you can convert your measurement after the fact.;
, Screens are measured diagonally, so your starting point will be either the bottom-left or bottom-right corner of the screen. The measurement only accounts for the actual screen, not the enclosure, so start your measurement at the very corner where the visible part of the screen starts.

, Remember that you are measuring just the visible portion of the screen, not any of the enclosure.


Screens were originally measured diagonally to make the size sound more impressive.

, Most retailers advertise screens in tenths of inches (15.3"", 17.1"", etc.), but most tape measures are marked in 16ths of an inch. If you want to know the retail number that your screen would be labeled, refer to this chart of common sizes.


, If you need to know the size of the screen in centimeters but only have the inches measurement, multiply the inches by 2.54 to find the measurement in centimeters.


For example, a 13.3 inch screen is 33.8 centimeters (13.3 x 2.54 = 33.782).

, The laptop's height is measured with a closed screen.

, If your laptop slopes when closed, measure the thickest part.

, Laptops aren't usually taller than two inches.

, If you need to know the height in centimeters but only have the inches measurement, multiply the inches by 2.54 to find the measurement in centimeters.


For example, a 1.5 inch tall laptop is 3.8 centimeters (1.5 x 2.54 = 3.81).

, Measuring the front is easiest because there are no protruding ports.

, Make sure to measure all the way to the end of any rounded edges.

, If you need to know the width in centimeters but only have the inches measurement, multiply the inches by 2.54 to find the measurement in centimeters.


For example, a 14 inch wide laptop is 35.6 centimeters (14 x 2.54 = 35.56).

,, Make sure to measure all the way to the end of any rounded edges.

, If you need to know the depth in centimeters but only have the inches measurement, multiply the inches by 2.54 to find the measurement in centimeters.


For example, a 12 inch deep laptop is 30.5 centimeters (12 x 2.54 = 30.48)."

Research the laptop skin that you want to purchase from the many that are available online.,

Measure the length and width of the top of your laptop using a measuring tape.,
Trace faintly on the laptop skin a rectangle the size of the measurements that you took from your laptop.,
Cut away the parts of the laptop skin that are outside of your faintly traced rectangle.,
Apply the laptop skin according to the directions that came with the particular laptop skin that you purchased.",How to Measure for a Laptop Skin," You will want to investigate several websites before making a final choice because of the number of options that are out there.;
, This will determine how much measuring you will need to do before ordering the laptop skin. Most websites will ask you for the model of your laptop and will send you a precut laptop skin that will be close to the size of your computer.

, Figure out whether your computer is a Mac or a PC. Mac sizing is fairly uniform so you can measure diagonally across the top of your laptop with a tape measure and find the correct value to enter. PC sizing varies fairly widely, so you may have to order a size that is slightly larger than your laptop (measured length and width) and then cut it to size.

, The laptop skin should be shipped directly to you.

, Do not include any protrusions such as hinges in your measurements. You will only want to cover the flat space on the top of the laptop with the skin.

, When doing this, be sure to capture the parts of the pattern or picture that are most important to you inside the rectangle.

, These parts should not be needed when you are applying the laptop skin to your laptop.

, After cutting away the excess, you should be left with just the right amount of laptop skin to cover your laptop.

Forums keep a record of every members IP address. And so if you try to sign up with a different user name and email address, they will know that it's you.;
, But bear in mind that the forum does not have to answer your email. And they do not have to give you a reason why you have been banned either. But if you do not get a response to your email, do not email the forum again and again. Or they can ban your IP address, and then you will not be able to go onto the site at all.

, Did you go off topic several times? Did you blow up at a forum member when they were rude to you? Or you could have been banned for other reasons. Think about what it was that got you banned and learn from your mistakes. And next time you sign up on a forum, do not make the same mistakes again.

, If your threads or threads you are posting on keep getting locked by the moderators. Or they keep getting moved from public view to private view. Meaning that your thread is not visible on the web or in search engines. And can only be read by other forum members. And even then they can still be locked or deleted by a moderator. This could be a sign that you are not welcome on the forum. In this case it is better that you leave the forum to avoid getting banned. If you are being made to feel uncomfortable on the forum. It is better to leave now, rather than end up getting banned later.

, Or you could be banned from that forum as well. Some forums will not allow anyone who has been banned from other forums on their forum.

, That is if you have your own blog, website or video channel, and your website or video channel is well known on the web. Or you may have several websites or video channels. Either way, some forums will ban you if you are well known on the web. Because they may think that you are using their forum to promote your website or your video channel. And this is not allowed on any forum. So if you are well known on the web, from your blog, website or video channel. Or you might be well known on the web from posts that you made on other forums. If that's the case, it would be better to use a different name and user name. That is different from the name and user name you use on your website or video channel.

, While this may be entertaining for your readers and viewers, forum moderators will not find it entertaining. And if you join another forum. And they find your posts and videos on the web about you being banned from other forums. They will ban your from their forum. So if you have posted on your website or video channel that you were banned from one or several forums. Then it might be worth thinking about using a different user name and name on the new forum. So that the admin and moderators do not link you to your website or videos. If you do not want to risk being banned from another forum.

, Rules on Windows and Linux forums are stricter than other forums. And you may have been banned for what you thought was nothing. Some forums are so strict they will ban you for saying""I don't use anti virus software. "" Or they will ban you for saying""Windows is better than Linux. "" You can also be banned for posting too many posts in a short time. Which made them think you were spamming or tolling. Both of which is against the rules. Or you could have been banned for something more minor, such as typing more than one post in all block capitals or ALL CAPS. Some of the rules are strict and do not make a lot of sense. If you don't agree with the rules or you find you do not fit in with the forum. It may be better to forget about forums, and post on your own blog or website instead. Then you are your own boss.

Cut the power cord about 2 feet (0.6 m) away from the connector that goes into your laptop, make a clean cut.,
Place jacket sleeves for the connectors onto the cables.,
Remove cable jacket only as much as the connector is long inside.,
Solder the insulated inner wire to the post.,
Wrap the soldered wire with electrical tape.,
Solder the outer wires to the connector frame.,
Crimp the frame to the wires.,
Wrap in electrical tape.,
Repeat at step 4 for the second connector.

,
If the smaller plug does not allow for electrical tape wrapping inside of it, at least wrap sleeve to the wire when you are complete.

",How to Make a Laptop Power Cord Quick Disconnect,"  The distance from the end of the cord should be determined by how far the cable runs on a table.  It is best if the disconnect is located in the portion of the cable that is typically hanging off the desk/table.;
,  Can't tell you how many times I forget this step.  If you forget, you have to undo all your work to put them on later and then start over.

,  Your different ends of the plug and connector may be different length.  Be sure to only cut back the jacket as much as needed.  Also, be careful to not cut the wires inside.  Typically, power cords have bare wires surrounding an insulated wire in the middle (one positive current and the other negative).  The bare wires surrounding should not be cut away.  Remove only the tip of the jacket sleeve for the inner insulated wire

,  The tab sticking straight out the back of the connector is best to be soldered to the inner insulated wire.  If you are able to insert the wire into the hole the tab may have, do so.  Otherwise, make sure that the solder gets hot enough to flow around the post and into the wire completely.

,  You only need a little, but this can help you avoid shorts in the wiring once you close up the connector.  A couple wraps is enough.

,  Twist the loose wires together to form a single combined strand.  Solder this to the 'frame' of the connector.  If the wire can be place through a hole, do so and then solder.  Make sure the solder flows completely into the wire strand and attached firmly to the frame.

,  Using a pair of pliers, squeeze the crimping bars around the wire to help remove the tension of a cable pull from your soldered points.

,  If there is enough room for your sleeve to cover your work, tightly wrap with electrical tape and down only the main cable.  This will help reduce the tension of a cable pull

, This can get you a warning from the moderators and you could also be banned from the forum for this. This may seem unfair, but a lot of admins are not interested in who started the argument. As far as they are concerned, if two people are both fighting and making the forum unpleasant, then one person is as guilty as the other one involved in the argument. So if someone is rude to you, ignore them.

, Just report that person to the admin or moderator. Many forums have a link you can click on, or means of contact for the forum admin that you can report that person to. This is a far better way of dealing with it that to be rude back to the member, even though they were rude to you.

, It is no good getting so worked up and upset that you get caught up in the argument, and that you end up posting hateful comments back to the members who are winding you up. And if you do this, you can end up being banned from the forum by the admin or moderators.

, Or you may have just got a nasty response from the members about what you posted on the forum. If this happens to you, DO NOT blow up at them by posting back swear words or hateful comments in order to get your own back at them. This will only make things worse and will also get you banned from the forum. Some forums will ban you permanently for this.

, A moderator or admin can lock the thread or delete the thread. This can be very upsetting when you have spent time and hours writing your posts. Only to have your thread locked or deleted by a moderator. If this happens to you DO NOT start another thread about the same topic that was locked or deleted. As that could get you a warning from the admin or moderator. And it can also get you banned from the forum. REMEMBER it is their website and they can do what they want. So they can lock your thread or the thread you are posting on. And they can delete the thread and there is nothing you can do about it.

, Is that forum right for you? Also think before you post. As everything you post will be public and read by everyone online. Is your post or topic right for the forum? Some forums will not allow some topics on their forum. So read the rules first. And if you are not sure about it, don't post it.

,, This will make the admin more angry and they will ban your IP address. Then you won't be able to view the site at all.

, Forums forbid multiple accounts and will ban you for this.

, Or you could be banned from that forum as well.

Most importantly, never back down.,
If you become an admin who is capable of banning people's accounts, don't go around banning everyone who gets on your nerves.",How to Be Respected on an Internet Forum," Whenever you come across somebody, whether they are being respectful or not, be respectful of them. Those deserving of it will give it back and, if they are already well-known in the community, will give you a slight popularity boost.;
, While using short hand and the like might be fine for texting, you have no excuse not to type out full words on a computer keyboard. Keystrokes take much less time here. Using proper grammar and spelling will make you seem more intelligent and worth knowing, and therefore more respectable.

, Whether on the boards themselves or PMing another user, it is very important not to insult another user. Insults make you seem petty and immature. You may have issues with another user, but take them somewhere else.

, It may seem like a ""teacher's pet"" kind of thing to do, but the mods will appreciate it (they have busy schedules) as they pride themselves on how well their forums are run. (For things like Myspace, don't be afraid to hit the ""report abuse"" button.)

, The worst thing to do is take your position in your online community for granted and think that the entire Internet should revolve around you. Even as you become better-known, don't let it feed your ego.

, If others have spelling or grammar mistakes, don't point them out unless you're absolutely certain that would be appreciated. Remember also that there's difference between saying ""The Moon Landing was in 1969, actually"" and ""Wasn't the Moon Landing in '69?"" Remember that voice tone does not carry through the Intertubes.

, You probably have enough enemies in real life, so why would you need more on the 'net? Even if you're not an outgoing person IRC, it's easy on the Internet, and the friendlier you are the better respected you will become.

, You don't have to think all of the same thoughts as the rest of the forum, but if you find yourself disagreeing with another user, do so in a way that doesn't involve insults or anger. Everybody's different--always remember that. (Never, ever tell somebody that they're wrong!)

, Even following all of the above rules is fine, but there will certainly be times when you are put in a situation where you are asked to do something you don't want to do or can't do (perhaps because of your personal beliefs). In these situations, it is important to say ""No"" and not give in to the pressure. Standing up for yourself in a manner that doesn't hurt anybody is, also, one of the most impressive and respectable things you can do.

, You will become hated by just about everyone.

, For example,you may have gone off topic in a thread,there may be something in your posts that have upset other members.

So if this happens to you it is best to leave the forum. As it is better leave now than be banned later.

, As this could get you a warning or a ban from the forum. The forum has the right to lock or delete your threads or any thread you are posting on. And they can edit or delete your posts or make your threads private view. Meaning your thread is not visible to anyone else on the web or in search engines. And only forum members can view it. You have no control over this.

, If a forum member is rude to you do not respond by being rude back to them. As this can quickly get out of hand and turn other members against you. And get you mistaken for trolling or inflaming other members. Moderators do not care about who started the argument.You could also end up being banned from the forum.

Searching on your own before asking is very important. If the solution to your question is easily searchable, you will receive scorn from the people that you ask the question to.
If you want to search a particular site for information, add ""site:example.com"" to the end of your search phrase. Google will only return results from the site you specify.;
, The internet is a huge place, and chances are you're not the first person to have the problem that you're experiencing. Take some time and hunt down potential answers that already exist. This can save you a lot of time and headaches down the road.

, If you've found some resources that help but don't completely solve your problem, make note of them. You can use these when you formulate your question to show others that you have already done your own research and to help them narrow down their responses.

, Determine what the general field of knowledge you will require to get it answered. For example, if you have a question about your computer, you will want tech experts to help. If your question is related to home improvement, you will want information from contractors.

, Once you know the general field, look at your question and figure out what niche you fit into. In every general category, there are a variety of sub-fields. For example, if your tech question is about using Windows, you'll want to focus on Windows experts. If your question is about a specific program in Windows, such as Photoshop, you'll want to find Photoshop experts as opposed to Windows experts.

, Enter in the category you need into a Google search and add the word ""forum"". For example, if you need to ask Photoshop questions, search for ""Photoshop forum"".

You can use the post body to add details, but readers should be able to understand your question just from looking at the title.For example, ""Windows won't start"" is not a good title. Instead, get a little more specific with your problem: ""Windows 7 will not start, computer turns on fine but I receive the following error message: <insert error snippet>"".

, After writing the title, explain the details in the body. List specific problems and what you have tried so far. Note any resources you have already looked at. The more specific you are, the more useful the replies to your question will be.


If you are asking technical questions, be sure to give proper information about what you are using. For example, for computer-related questions, list your operating system, system specs, and any error messages you are getting. For car questions, make sure to note the make and model, as well as what part of the car you are working on.

, You will get far more responses if your post is written with good grammar and clear writing. Avoid overusing exclamation points, and try not to swear (even if you're really frustrated!). If the language of the board is not your first language, let the readers know and apologize for any spelling and grammar errors.


Avoid internet shorthand and slang. For example, don't replace ""you"" with ""u"", and don't type IN ALL CAPS, as this is perceived as shouting.

, Even if you are experiencing multiple problems, limit each post to one question. This will help the responders focus on the issue and provide clear advice. If a reader sees your question, but then opens your post and sees five more questions, he or she will likely not respond at all.

, There's a chance that you won't like the answer you receive. There's also a chance that the answer that you don't like is the only available option. Make sure to keep an open mind about your responses, and try to avoid getting defensive.

, If one of the responders has solved your question, make sure to thank them and note that the problem has been solved. This will help other people with the same problem quickly see what you had to do to fix it, and the gratitude gives the responder reason to continue answering questions for others.

, If you don't receive any responses, or the responses are not satisfactory, take some time to examine your question. Was it specific enough? Did you ask too many questions? Was the answer easily obtained through a web search? Is the question even answerable? Rework your question and ask it again, either in the same place or a new one.


Never believe that you are entitled to an answer. Responders volunteer their time to help out other users. No one owes you an answer, so you should avoid acting like they do."

Send a thank you note.",How to Ask for a Letter of Recommendation Through Email," If you’re going to ask for a letter of recommendation, you need to double check where it’s going. Since letters are often expected to be kept confidential, the recipient of your request will need to know where to send the letter of recommendation; the last thing you want is to give them incorrect information. Also make sure to double check the application deadlines.


If the letter of recommendation needs to be mailed, you should consider providing the recipient with a pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelope.;
, Before asking a professor or previous employer for a letter of recommendation, you should consider your relationship with them. Make sure to choose someone who you got along with and will actually remember you. Prioritize professors or employers who recognized your accomplishments and already seemed interested in helping you along your career. Whether they gave you great grades, helped you in your development or gave you a raise, they should be the first people you ask.


If you need to ask for a recommendation from someone you know outside the workplace or academia, you should be clear and upfront. Don’t hide your request under the pretense of meeting for coffee. Let them know they can refuse without damaging your relationship and always be understanding if they do., You need to be understanding in making your request. If you’re sending your request to a professor, you need to consider that they’ve received many requests just like yours around the end of the semester and near application deadlines. Plan to make your request at least a month before your application deadline, to give your professor enough time to draft a great recommendation letter.


If you’re asking a previous employer for a recommendation letter, try to avoid doing so during times you remember being busier while working under them., The first thing your request should mention after your greeting is your name. Not only that, but your request’s first paragraph should help remind the recipient of who you are. This will be done differently depending on how close you were with the recipient and when you last spoke.


If you’re sending your request to a professor, try to outline the time you spent with them in their office. You can also mention the grade you received and the challenges you experienced. It might look like this: “Dear Professor X, I took your organic chemistry class last semester. While I found it challenging, I always appreciated how available you were and how you helped me understand any mistakes I made on tests.”
When dealing with a previous employer, your greeting will likely focus on projects you’ve worked on or responsibilities that were given to you. If there are any amusing anecdotes you can recall, consider including them. “Dear Mr. Y, my name is Jane Smith and I worked with you on the latest merger at XYZ company. I greatly appreciated the opportunity to learn more about this delicate aspect of the corporate world.” , You should communicate clearly to the recipient the reasons you’re asking them for a letter of recommendation. Explain why you value their opinion and respect their qualifications. Your goal here shouldn’t be to flatter the person you’re sending your request to, but rather convey why they’re uniquely suited for writing your recommendation letter.


For a professor, here’s what this would look like: “As the department chair, you assisted me in my progress throughout my major, and were always available to help me when things proved too challenging. Your position within the department, as well as the close attention you paid to my academic career make you the ideal person to write a strong letter of recommendation.”
Here’s an example of how to do with with an employer: “As my direct supervisor for so long, you provided me with critical feedback that greatly helped me along my professional career. As such, I think you’re uniquely suited to write a strong recommendation letter.”, An employer or professor might feel the need to embellish the letter if they know you’ll be reading it. This might even make them uncomfortable when writing the letter. Include a short sentence confirming that they can send the letter of recommendation directly, bypassing you., You shouldn’t write your request assuming that the recipient will agree to write a letter of recommendation. There are a few reasons why a professor or previous employer might not be able to or willing to write a letter. You need to respect this. Near the end of the letter, mention that you’ll understand if they aren’t able to complete your request for any reason., Drafting the best request won’t mean much if it doesn’t end up in the right place. Confirm the recipient’s contact information. For professors, you can usually find this on the college or university website. Otherwise, you can ask common acquaintances or the recipient directly for their email address.

, Your initial request is short on purpose. Its purpose is to convince your professor or employer to agree to write a recommendation letter; you don’t need to include all necessary information in your first contact. Be ready to answer any questions or concerns the recipient may have as soon as you can. If an email from them sits in your mailbox for too long, you may not get your letter of recommendation in time., Once your professor or employer has agreed to write a recommendation letter, you should be ready to thank them. They’ve done you a great service that can advance your professional or academic career. Wait about a week or two before sending the note; they’ll likely be done with the letter and will appreciate the gesture."

Read the terms of service (TOS) very carefully, then you understand what is allowed and what's not.,
If the free forum service has a help forum,read it.,
If your forum is about Windows, Linux or computer software, ask on the help forum if you are allowed to post download links to your files on file sharing sites like MediaFire and others like it.,
Do not write any offensive content.,
If you want to do something on your forum and you are not sure if it is allowed or noted ASK in the help forums first.,
Some other subjects are not allowed on free forum hosting sites.,
Even if you host on your own domain name,custom URL,that you have bought through the free forum hosting service,you are still subject to their terms of service.,
Bear in mind,if you are hosting on a free forum site even on a your own custom URL that you bought through them.",How to Avoid Getting Your Free Forum Deleted,";
, A lot of free forum services have their own help forum where you can ask questions regarding your forum. And get help if you have a problem with your forum. And it is there you can get an idea if the free forum service has deleted or suspended a lot of forums,for no real reason.

, Many free forums services do not allow this. Not even if they are your own files that you own. So if they say it is against their terms of service then you CANNOT DO IT. And you will also have to tell your members not to post links to their files on Mediafire.

, That is no forums that contain nudity or porn or other hate content. And do not post links on your forum to offensive content. And do not let your members do it either. Or they will delete your forum.

, That way you have covered yourself and can avoid breaking their terms of service. And avoid getting your forum suspended or deleted.

, For example if you want to create a political forum about support for a political group they do not approve of. Or if you want to create a forum about gaming, be careful. Because a lot of free forum hosting services do not allow this. And they will delete your forum. So if you want to write about these topics,a free blog on a service like WordPress might be better. As the free blogging services are not so strict as the free forum hosting services. And most free blogging services will never delete or suspend your blog,unless in unless you do something very bad.

, Hosting your forum on your own custom URL for example ""myforum.com"" just means that you have bought your domain name from the free forum hosting site. But they are still hosting your forum for you,the same as they are when you are hosting your forum on their domain name. So all you have paid for is your own website name and a few perks like disable adverts,nothing else. But you are still subject to all of their terms of service. And they will suspend or delete your forum if you violate their terms of service.

, That you do not have full control over your forum. This is because you are still hosting your forum through them and using their servers,custom URL or not. And they can still suspend and delete your forum any time if they want to.

",How to Access Newsgroups," Windows Vista and Windows 7 provide newsreaders in Windows Mail. In older versions of Windows, look for your newsreader in Outlook Express. Otherwise, access newsgroups through one of the many portals on the Internet. Some popular newsgroups include Usenet.org, Google Groups, and Yahoo! Groups. Mac users have various options to download, including Unison, NewsFire, and NewsHunter.;
, In Windows Mail, find ""Newsgroups"" under ""Tools"" on the Menu bar. If you're accessing newsgroups through another server, follow the instructions to create a newsgroup server account. Some public newsgroups require downloading a specific newsgroup reader. Others like Google Groups allow users to access Usenet through their site.

, These subjects can be as broad or specific as you want. For example, you can join a guitar group or a Rickenbacker guitar newsgroup. The newsgroup server will show all available newsgroups available on the server. In Windows Mail, choose a newsgroup, and click subscribe. Google Group users click on subjects, and then subcategories until finding the right one. Mac users can open up choices by clicking on a newsgroup so that a minus sign or downward arrow appears. Once a user finds a newsgroup to join, it's just a matter of clicking on subscribe.

, The search will reveal all groups that fit.

, With Google and Yahoo!, it's as simple as signing up with your email address .

, The newsgroup information will appear in your e-mail window if you are using Windows Mail or in your browser window. Some newsgroup servers also allow users the option of receiving news as separate emails or summarized in a digest format.

Reply promptly to the email.,
Know how to politely ask for clarification.,
Use proper spelling and grammar.,
Include the original question that the sender asked.,
Proofread your email before sending it.",How to Answer Questions over Email Professionally," When you receive the e-mail, do not wait for days or weeks to respond to it. This might be upsetting to the sender, and be unprofessional, especially in a workplace setting. If you do not know the answer to a question, you can ask someone else who might know the answer. For instance, if someone asks you if school supplies are required or just for donation, write back with something like this: ""I do not know if school supplies are required, but I have asked our supervisor about this, and will follow up with you as soon as possible."";
, If you do not understand what the sender is asking, you can ask him or her to clarify. You can try writing a polite and professional note like this: ""I am sorry, but I do not understand what you are asking. Would you please elaborate?"" The sender is likely to respond with elaboration of his/her question, so that you can answer it.

, This goes without saying. Many people on the Internet use improper grammar, which is very unprofessional, especially in an e-mail to someone. If you're not a good speller, try using an online spell check resource so that your spelling is correct. You should also read up on how to use proper English punctuation.

, Try to reshape this question into an answer instead of replying to an e-mail. This is especially important if the sender is asking a closed-ended question (such as a yes/no question, or a multiple-option question in which you would need to answer with a certain option). For instance, if the sender asked you ""Does school start next Tuesday?"" do not just reply with ""Yes"". Reply with ""Yes, school starts next Tuesday"".


In face-to-face conversation, people usually answer closed-ended questions with one word, but e-mail is different. It can be confusing to the sender when you reply to a closed-ended question with one word, since the sender will have to scroll down to find his or her original question.

, It can be easy not to catch small typos or accidental grammar/spelling mistakes. These things can be avoided through proofreading.

Use tools for filtering and organizing your emails. Decide how often and at what times you will be checking your emails. Depending on your job requirements, it can be anything from once a week to five times per day.
, Then process older unread emails. Once you have decided when you will be processing emails and task requests, for example once in the morning and once in the afternoon, apply the 4D method to all new incoming emails. Plan time in your agenda to work through older messages in reverse chronological order. At some point, you will have gone so far back that you can simply select all and mark as read., Ask yourself if this task request actually needs to be done, or can it be deleted? For example, if someone asks you to translate a certain document, but it has been decided that a translation will not be needed, simply reply to the sender informing them that this task is no longer a requirement. Mark the email as read, archive it and/or delete it., Does this task need to be done by you? If a task request needs to be done, ask yourself if you are the one who has to do it. For example, if someone asks you to give them a three dimensional drawing of an engine, and this is not your area of expertise, send a reply to the sender stating just that. Include the person responsible for this task and ask to either be excluded from all subsequent emails or be placed in copy only., Can this task be done right now? If the task request can be done in less than three minutes, do it now, even if you are extremely busy and have urgent deadlines. For example, if someone asks you for a certain reference number, look it up and reply immediately. This will complete the task and avoids another low priority bullet added to your to do list., If a task request can’t be deleted, it must be done by you, but you can’t do it right now, open your agenda and plan it. Take into account the timing requested, as well as your other priorities. Once you have scheduled it, reply to the sender, saying why you can’t do it right now and when they can expect your feedback."

Use the Internet as a resource when researching a person's background and accomplishments, or consult with your subject's publicist, if applicable.

, Your questions should contain only one inquiry or concept per question to keep the task clear and to the point. For example, for your first question, ask the subject if they enjoy drinking wine, then for the second question, inquire about the subject's favorite type of wine.


Write 1 or 2 general questions to begin the interview, then segue into more specific questions or topics as the interview progresses. For example, begin by asking a pastry chef why they chose baking as a career, then ask them additional questions specifically about the new bakery they are opening in your city.

Plug the laptop in.If power the LED (typically on the side or back of the unit near the power port) does not come on when you attempt to turn on the unit, there may be an issue with your laptop battery.,
Try it without the battery.,
Test the power outlet.,
Gently jiggle the power cord where it plugs into the laptop.As you do this, watch the power LED light.,
Try a new AC adapter.,
Call your manufacturer or computer repair shop for recommendations.",How to Troubleshoot Computer Startup Problems1," Connect the laptop to a power source with the AC (power) adapter if you’ve not already done so. Leave it plugged in for several minutes before turning it back on.;
, With the laptop unplugged, remove the battery. Reconnect the power cable and try turning on the computer. If the computer turns on without the battery, you’ll need to buy a new laptop battery.


If it still won’t power on, unplug the power cord from the laptop, then hold down the power button for 5 to 30 seconds.
Next, attempt to turn the computer back on—first with no battery, then with the battery installed. If it turns on without the battery this time (but not with the battery installed), buy a new battery.

, First, if you’re using a power strip or extension cord, remove it and plug the laptop directly into the wall. Both extension cords and power strips can fail. If the computer still won’t turn on with those items out of the equation, rule out problems with the power outlet by plugging in a different electrical device, such as a lamp that you know works.

, Lightly jiggle the connector back and forth, up and down. If the LED flickers, the issue is either with your AC adapter or the power port in your computer. Even if it doesn’t flicker, one of these components could be the issue.


Look inside the power port of the laptop to see if anything appears loose, broken or missing. If you can, try to jiggle the connector inside the port (gently) with your finger. Abnormalities indicate that the port will need to be repaired. If something is off, call your manufacturer’s support line to see if you qualify for a free repair.
Another option is to replacing the power jack in the laptop yourself. Like going to a repair shop, replacing the power pin yourself could void your warranty.

, If the power jack appears normal, or if you’re simply unable to determine whether or not it’s defective, try a new power adapter. It’s crucial to remember that the adapter must be the exact model recommended by your computer manufacturer. Using the wrong power cable can fry your computer. See How to Check the Compatibility of an AC Adapter and Your Computer for tips on finding the right adapter.

, If the laptop still won’t power on, the issue is likely with the motherboard. If your computer is still under warranty, you may qualify for a free replacement or repair.

Remove every cable plugged into the power supply except for the one that connects directly to the motherboard (the large flat component that everything is connected to. Try booting the computer.
If the computer turns on, the power supply is functional, but one of the other devices in the computer is not. Turn the computer off and plug one of the devices back into the power supply, and start the computer again. Repeat this with every device until you find the one that prevents the computer from turning on. Replace the offending hardware (or call your manufacturer for support).
If the computer still doesn’t turn on, your power supply is defective.

, If you feel comfortable replacing the power supply yourself, see How to Diagnose and Replace a Failed PC Power Supply. Make sure you are properly grounded as you work.

, If nothing seems to be working or you feel uncomfortable opening the case of your computer, call your computer manufacturer and ask if you qualify for a free repair. If you don’t, ask for a recommendation for an authorized technician.

Understand that high temperatures can damage components.,
Know that the acceptable upper limit for component temperature is generally around 80–90 °C (176–194 °F).,
Improve your computer’s cooling.",How to Tell How Hot Your Computer Is3," To prevent damage, the cooling system needs to be carefully regulated. The more stress you put on the components, such as the processor, video card, and hard drive, the more heat they generate.


For the average user using a factory manufactured computer, heat build-up isn’t usually a major issue. When you’re building your own computer, or upgrading an existing one, temperature and cooling becomes an important concern.






The older the computer becomes, the more prone to heat failure it becomes. Cooling systems will degrade and fail with age, and dust can seriously hamper heat dispersion.






If components become too hot, they can become permanently damaged. This can lead to system failure and data loss.







, The temperature threshold varies from component to component. Average temperatures in a well-cooled system should be in the 40–60 °C (104–140 °F) range.

, There are a variety of ways to improve your computer’s ability to cool itself. The easiest method is blowing out dust from the inside of the computer using compressed air. Dust will cause fans to slow down and hinder the cooling properties of heat sinks. Dust your computer regularly to keep it running as cool as possible.


If you are using a desktop computer, you may be able to install more fans. This will require opening the case and connecting fans to the case and the motherboard. Check out our guide on installing fans for more information.

Build a new computer.",How to Service a Computer," Viruses are the main cause of most people's computer problems. Removing viruses and ensuring that you remain virus-free will help your computer's health significantly.


If you don't have one already, install an antivirus program. Mac users should install an antivirus program as well, as Macs are becoming larger targets for viruses.;
, Adware are programs that are often installed alongside other programs, and can be difficult to get rid of. These programs send you targeted ads and may hijack your browser. Some are a risk to your personal information.

, Too many toolbars can cause your browser to slow to a crawl, and many can be incredibly difficult to remove. If you can't remove the toolbars, no matter what you try, you may need to reinstall your browser or install a different browser.

, If you have a lot of programs installed that you don't use, they will sit on your hard drive taking up space, and potentially slowing your computer down by running in the background. Go through your programs list and remove any programs that you don't use anymore.


See this guide for instructions on deleting programs in OS X.

, Lots of programs, both legitimate and illegitimate, will attach themselves to your startup process. When you get too many programs trying to start when your operating system is loading, it can really slow your computer down.

, For optimal efficiency, your hard disk should always have at least 15% of the space on it available, preferably at least 25%. Having more free space allows your operating system to move files around during installation and defragmenting.

, Your Windows registry contains information for all of your installed programs. Oftentimes, when a program is uninstalled, it will leave behind entries in the registry. As these pile up, Windows can take longer to find the entries it needs.

, Oftentimes, updating your operating system will fix a particular problem you've been having. Installing the latest updates will also help ensure that your computer is as secure as possible from outside attacks.


See this guide for instructions for updating OS X.

, When bad things happen to your computer, the worst potential loss is your data. Setting up a backup system will help protect your important files from hardware failure or a virus attack. Having backups of everything important makes changing your hardware much less stressful as well.

, If you just can't solve a problem you're having with your operating system, it may be easier to just reinstall the operating system and start over. Having your data backed up will make the reinstallation process very painless.


Reinstall Windows 7
Reinstall Windows 8
Reinstall OS X

, Unless you work in a perfectly sterile environment, dust will build up in your computer. Dust can cause your components to overheat and can clog fans. Too much dust can also lead to short circuits. Try to clean out the dust inside your computer monthly.

, If your operating system is crashing often, you may have faulty memory. Replacing RAM is one of the easier hardware tasks that you can perform, but picking the right RAM can be difficult.


You can test your memory using a program called MemTest86.

, If you're having problems installing programs, files are getting corrupted, or you are experiencing crashes, your hard drive may be failing. There are several ways that you can check your hard disk for errors which may be fixable. If your hard drive has failed completely, you can install a new one.


If the hard drive that failed contained your operating system, you will need to reinstall it after installing the drive.

, If the colors are completely wrong or your images is distorted, your video card may be failing. If you can, test the card by plugging in a different monitor first before committing to a new video card.

, If your disc drive isn't reading discs properly, or it's very loud when reading a disc, you may need to install a new drive. Basic DVD drives are very cheap, and you can have the new drive installed in just a few minutes.

, If your computer is overheating, you can be causing serious damage to your components. Many computers will shut themselves down if a certain temperature is reached, so if you are experiencing shutdowns, especially when running intensive programs, your computer may be overheating. Installing more fans or replacing defective ones can make a big difference on the internal temperature.


You can install software to monitor the temperatures inside your computer.

, If your computer is randomly shutting off, or isn't turning on, your power supply may be failing or dead. You can test your power supply to see if it's the culprit. If it is, you can replace it with a newer or more powerful one.

, If you've tried everything and your computer is just not speeding up, it may be time to start over. Building a new computer is less scary than it sounds, and you may be able to reuse some of your existing components (if they're not too old)."

Understand your motivations for archiving the site.,
Consider contacting the site owners to obtain dumps.,
Check if there are recent archives of the website.,
Check to see if there are any specialized tools to download the site.,
Figure out if the site has limit to how many requests you can make in a certain amount of time.,
Try running a wget command on the site.,
Examine the website to see if there are any patterns or structure to it.,
If the site has a lot of JavaScript, consider more advanced or tedious techniques for downloading the site.,
If a site is password-protected or otherwise requires authentication, export cookies.,
Use multiple computers or IP addresses to speed up archival.,
Automate as much as possible.,
Consider releasing your archives.",How to Archive Websites on Unix Like Systems," It is important to know what you are trying to do in archiving the site. There are several reasons one might want to archive a website, and these influence your strategy:


You may just want an archive of the site to exist, without necessarily caring about who maintains it. If this is the case, refer to the step ""Check if there are recent archives of the website.""
You may want to maintain a personal copy (i.e. have the archive locally). This might be the case if you can't trust others to keep archives online (e.g. if the site content is copyrighted or illegal, then it may be subject to takedowns, in which case it is safer to have local copies).
You may want only the snapshot of the site at a certain point in time. This might be the case if you are writing something and want to your citations to be durable; you can just take a snapshot of the site at the time when you used the site as a resource.
You may want to continually make snapshots of the site. This might be the case if you have an unseemly obsession with the site's content or its owners.
You may want only parts of the site (e.g. the pages you cite).

Note that the above points aren't mutually exclusive (although some are contradictory, like wanting parts of a site versus the whole site); in other words, you may want someone to have an archive, you yourself to keep an archive, and for continual snapshots to be made, all at the same time.

, It's possible the site owners will oblige by for instance giving you their backups of the site. However also keep in mind that this will make transparent to them your intentions, so they may react in an unfavorable way (e.g. by password-protecting parts of the site).

, It is important to remember that doing work isn't inherently valuable; believing so would be to commit the make-work bias.Archiving large websites can often take a lot of time and effort. If someone else has already done the bulk of the work for you, then there is no need to feel compelled to repeat the task all over again.

If someone else has made a recent backup of the site, then you might be done (if you just wanted someone else to have a copy) or close to being done (if you just wanted one local snapshot; your task reduces to that of mirroring their backup, which is likely substantially easier than the original task).

There are several places one should check before proceeding with one's own archiving solution (which is presented in the rest of the steps):



The Archiveteam wiki. The Archive team is a group of volunteers specializing in archiving websites. Their wiki has information on a variety of websites and the progress that has been made toward archiving them. Try searching around on the wiki to see what work (if any) has been done. The Archive Team also has public logs of their IRC (internet relay chat) channels. In particular, try searching #archiveteam and #archiveteam-bs.

The Internet Archive. The Internet Archive has a massive store of cached versions of various websites. See the guide on Archiveteam's wiki for more information on how to access this.
Search Google. Search for the site's name followed by words like ""archive"" and ""mirror"".

, There are sometimes special tools for downloading particular content. For instance, if you want to download many YouTube videos, there is a tool called youtube-dl. Many sites also have an API (application programming interface) that allows you to easily programmatically access content. This is the case with for example reddit, which as a well-documented API (though also note that there is already a fairly comprehensive archive of reddit, which was itself created using reddit's API).

, If no one else has recently archived the site and if there are no specialized tools to archive the site, then you are on your own. It is good practice to figure out if the site you are targeting has any special rules on how much or how quickly you can download content. Many sites have clearly-defined rules, which are frequently listed under their terms of service/use. Even if you don't personally care whether the site wants to limit your access, this is still good to keep in mind, since they may have automatic IP banning (and other measures) in place to prevent people from overloading their servers or ""stealing"" their content.

See the step ""Use multiple computers or IP addresses to speed up archival"" for ways to get around this limit.

, Wget is a p

rogram that can download content from the internet, and is included by default on many Unix-like systems. Sometimes, a single wget command can download all or most of the site.If this is the case, the task becomes trivial. However, it is still important to start out the crawl on a page that is likely to link to many other pages, since wget begins at the starting page (called the ""seed"") and recursively follows internal links. Locating a sitemap page is ideal, if the site has one.
Here is a sample command with many useful flags turned on:



wget --mirror --page-requisites \
    --adjust-extension --convert-links \
    --wait=1 --random-wait --no-clobber \
    -e robots=off \
    http://example.com/sitemap.html



Be sure to change http://example.com/sitemap.html as well as any flags to suit your needs. Here are the meanings of the flags, although you should also consult the official wget documentation (or info wget) as well as its manual (type man wget):


--mirror turns on several options favorable to mirroring the site, including recursively following links.

--page-requisites makes wget download images, stylesheets, and other files that help to produce an appearance faithful to the original.

--adjust-extension adds the suffix .html to HTML files to make them easier to browse locally.

--convert-links alters linking in downloaded files so they are suitable for local browsing.

--wait=1 forces wget to wait for 1 second between requests (however, see the next option as well).

--random-wait randomly multiplies the constant from --wait for each request so that the download pattern is less suspicious; this plausibly helps prevent being IP banned.

--no-clobber will preserve local copies of a file instead of overwriting or downloading new copies. This is something to consider if the download was stopped in the middle.

-e robots=off turns off obeying the robots.txt file of a site. Some people consider it respectful to follow the rules in robots.txt, but sometimes whole sites are excluded by robots.txt (if the owners put Disallow: /). The Archiveteam, for one, considers robots.txt ""a suicide note"" and ignores it.

Consider also using the following options:


--user-agent='Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/40.0' will set your user agent to appear as if you are using Firefox to access the site. This is useful since some sites disallow crawler-like user agents or else display different pages depending on the user agent.

--restrict-file-names=nocontrol will prevent wget from touching special characters in the URL. This often is useful if you are downloading from a site with filenames containing many Unicode characters.cURL is a similar utility to wget that has similar features. On Mac OS X and many BSD systems, cURL is the default downloader instead of wget. You may also be interested in finding other programs that are intended for mirroring sites, such as HTTrack.
, If a site cannot be mirrored easily using wget (or similar utility), then it is time for another strategy. Many sites, such as web forums, have explicit patterns in the URL, such as numbered threads.

To take an example, we can look at AutoAdmit, a notorious discussion board. One of the threads on the site has the URL http://autoadmit.com/thread.php?thread_id=2993725&mc=12&forum_id=2. However, we might notice that the only crucial number here is the thread_id; indeed, navigating to just http://autoadmit.com/thread.php?thread_id=2993725 shows an essentially identical page. We might now try to deduce that the general AutoAdmit URL structure is http://autoadmit.com/thread.php?thread_id=N, where N is some number; trying several URLs that are instances of this general pattern confirms this. After this, it is a matter of looping through all the threads and downloading them; in bash:



for i in {1..2993725}
do 
    wget -A 'Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/40.0' \
        ""http://xoxohth.com/thread.php?thread_id=$i""
    sleep 0.3s
done



Of course, the URL structure of AutoAdmit is one of the simplest. Other sites, like WordPress blogs, may require e.g. looping through the archive pages after calculating how many pages of posts are in each month (though WordPress blogs also tend to be quite amenable to a naïve crawl). There is no general way to go about this, so you might be on your own; searching around on Google can often be very helpful.

, In recent times, the web has shifted increasingly toward the heavy use of JavaScript and other interactive elements (sometimes called DOM scripting). While this shift has allowed the web to ""rival native applications without a hefty initial download, without an install process, and do so across devices old and new"", it is still often the subject of ridiculeand criticism. In terms of archiving websites, JavaScript and interactive elements are almost always bad news. There are several strategies of trying to deal with archiving a JavaScript-heavy site.
One approach is to try to avoid JavaScript entirely. Many sites make available RSS or Atom feeds that readers can use to keep up with new content. For archivers, web feeds are useful because it is static XML, which makes downloading and processing easy. This is especially useful if you want to continue making snapshots of the site: just follow the relevant feeds and you will automatically have what you want (if you're lucky; many sites only show previews on feeds, or the authors may edit the content afterwards, etc., which complicates matters). A caveat here is that most web feeds only contain the newest several posts or articles, so retroactively archiving a site may not be possible.

Other things to look into:

In-browser JavaScript to e.g. automatically click on elements
PhantomJS and other headless browsers
Websites frequently change their UI so keeping up can be hard

, Sites that require authentication are tricky to access through tools like wget. However, it is possible to export cookies from graphical browsers like Firefox, then use the cookies to access the sites on wget. Firefox as the plugin Export Cookies, which works well., If a website can relatively quickly detect crawlers and ban them, one option (besides slowing down) is to connect to the site using multiple IP addresses. There are multiple ways to do this; here are two: one simple form of having multiple IP addresses is to change your physical location by for instance visiting several cafés or libraries; at each new location, you will have a fresh IP address with which to download from the site. Another option is to obtain access to multiple computers, by for instance purchasing access to virtual private servers. An advantage of the latter option is that you can have multiple IP addresses that can download simultaneously, which will speed up the downloading process instead of simply allowing you to continue the download. However, note that the latter option often involves spending money, although this can be as low as $15 per year. The latter form of downloading is in addition of questionable legality.

It is also possible to use the anonymity network Tor to continually alter your IP by changing exit nodes. However, it is highly discouraged to abuse Tor in this way., If you expect to continue making archives of the site or if the target site is enormous, then it becomes very important to automate as much of the process as possible.

, There are several reasons you might want to release your archives to the public. For one, you have now gone through a time-consuming process of archiving the site; if others also want local copies, then it's likely they would be gratified to find that someone else has done the work for them. In addition, ""lots of copies keep stuff safe"", so allowing others to mirror your archives ensures that it is safer against threats like disk failure. See for instance the Internet Archive's upload page for more.

Know that the 'div' tag is basically utilized to establish separate areas or divisions of the website page.,
Consider redesigning an existing website with 'div' tags.,
Understand the benefits of making use of div tags or table-less:


Loading of sites become faster.",How to Design a Simple Web Page in Div," This is amongst the extremely powerful elements in “XHTML”, since it is necessary for placing the design of web page using “CSS”.;
, In simple words, this process means implementing sites devoid of making use of tables for layout and positioning. 'Div' tags use style sheets which are commonly referred to as “Cascading style sheets” or “CSS” which allow the web design of the site to be independent of data. Designing backgrounds with colors and fonts, width, height, layout and positioning of rows or columns can all be inserted into style sheets leaving only div code and information on actual pages.

, Websites that are based on 'div' tags render browsers to run much faster as they come in a very light weight. 'Div' is controlled through Cascading style sheets and therefore, needs less coding that helps in keeping the file size to the minimal.
'Div' is friendly to all search engines – CSS based websites are search engine optimization friendly as these enable the web designer to keep main articles on top allowing search engines to find main contents more easily.
A 'div' tag based website saves bandwidth. A table-less website has smaller file size, which means that it saves your bandwidth. If you have a huge traffic site, where each page is browsed by the site visitors, you shall save on the bandwidth size by not having tables. This saved bandwidth amount could be useful over a time period or at the end of the month.
Cleaner Code – The websites using 'div' tags and CSS generates cleaner code. This cleaner code permits crawlers of search engines to read the actual content.

Make It Responsive.,
Remember, Content Is KING.,
Make It Socially Shareable.,
Use Large Images, But Optimize It All!,
Integrate Your Blog.,
Get Your Website Hosted.",How to Design a Modern Website," With an audience that is always on the go, the chances of a website being viewed on a conventional desktop are very less. A website that is solely designed for desktops becomes a pain to access on the mobile devices. A responsive design ensures that when your website is accessed on a mobile device, it delivers the same functionalities in as efficient a manner as it does while being viewed on the desktop.


With over 20% of web browsing done on mobile devices, you don’t want to be missing out on your audience and potential customers just because your business website didn’t offer the right call to action functionalities to its viewers.
Another factor that you need to be taking care of while choosing a theme or a template for your website is its ‘retina readiness’. It should be able to support high resolution images that are suited for these.;
, If you haven’t been keeping a tab on what’s trending in the digital market, here’s what you’ve missed: Content is the new black; it really is the KING. Your website’s performance not just depends on the web design but also on the content in it. A good website keeps the viewer hooked on til all the tabs are explored, but great content makes sure that the viewer keeps coming back for more.


A constant flow of content is vital to establish a prominent online presence. It ensures constant user engagement thereby guaranteeing more social sharing and higher rankings on the various search engines.

, The growing popularity of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter etc is stranger to none. The amount of audience that can be driven to your website through these platforms is surprisingly high.


So while creating your website, take social sharing features into consideration. Most CMSs offer plugins to enable social sharing; all you need to do is activate them and place them at a visible location on your website.
To make sure your audience stays hooked onto your website, update your social profiles regularly; this ensures a prominent online presence as well.

, Incorporate a lot of images relevant to your business (and trending in your circles) - they are the most shared post type these days. That’s great, but the one thing that most business websites ignore is optimizing these images.


Make sure all your web content - text, images, audio, video etc - are optimized at all times to ensure a decent load time on all the devices it is viewed on. A load time that exceeds three seconds usually results in greater number of bounce offs.

, The best way to engage audience on a business website, is to offer them read-worthy content. Adding a blog is a great way to ensure content flow and every article that you add to it gives Google another reason to crawl and index your website better

, Once you have all your web content in place, you want it to be easily accessible to all your users at all times. To ensure that, get your website hosted. A webhosting service provider offers web space on its server for you to store all your web content and logs. The server basically serves up your website to the World Wide Web via the Internet in the most efficient manner possible. Depending upon the resources your website needs to run efficiently, you can basically choose from the following hosting plans:


Shared Hosting
Dedicated Hosting
VPS Hosting
Reseller Hosting
Cloud Hosting

Brand your images if you want to prevent others from copying the images from your blog and using them without your permission.,
Add images to create an art blog that is visually stimulating.",How to Create an Art Blog," The most popular services are Blogger and WordPress, but there are many other services available. Some of these services are completely free to use (such as Blogger) while others may require you to purchase a domain (your blog address) or pay a fee for hosting (online storage space).;
, When you use any blogging service to create the blog you will be asked to choose the following blog attributes.


Blog URL: The URL (also known as the domain address) is the complete address of the blog, usually beginning with ""and ending with "".com"". If you are getting a free domain address, you may be required to include a name for the blogging service that is providing the address as part of the URL. (For example, if you create your art blog with Blogger for free the URL may look like ""artblog.blogspot.com"" because Blogger requires that you include the word ""blogspot"" to indicate that you have a blog that is hosted through Blogger). Try to use the main keyword that describes your blog within the domain address.
Blog name: Ideally, the name of your blog should match the main keyword used in your blog's domain address. For example, if your blog is about abstract art then you should include the keyword ""abstract art"" in the blog's name and URL. Alternately, you may want to include your name in the blog name and URL (such as ""Art by Bill Joe"") if the main objective of the blog is to promote yourself as an artist. It all depends on what type of art blog you want to create.

, The template basically determines the design of your blog and how content should be displayed within it. The template should match the theme of your blog or the style of art that will be displayed on it. Most blogging services allow you to preview different templates to help you pick the best one for your blog. Here are some attributes included in the template.


Font: The font refers to how the letters, numbers and punctuations will be displayed on your blog. The template specifies the font name as well as the font size and color.
Color scheme: Each template has a color scheme that specifies the color of the background and also the color of other design elements such as the header and menu bars.
Background image: At times you may be allowed to select a background image for your blog. If so, you can choose a background image that compliments your blog's theme but make sure it does not interfere with the readability of blog posts.

, Here are some ideas to help you get started.


Create content that is unique. Being an artist is all about being different and expressing who you are.
Share personal stories so people can relate to your work.
Proofread each blog post before publishing to minimize grammatical errors that may make your blog less appealing.

, Here are 2 methods of branding that you may want to consider.


Add your signature to the images that you want to brand. Although using this method does prevent others from claiming your work as theirs, people may still try to republish your signed artwork without your permission or try to remove your signature using image-editing programs.
Create watermarks. Watermarks are a more effective method of branding because they cover the whole canvas area occupied by the image. The watermark can be a faded texture or symbol (for example, the artist's logo) and can be made using an image-editing software such as Adobe Photoshop by creating a new top layer containing the texture or symbol and then increasing its transparency.

, Of course, people want you to share your art on your blog or at least see your style of work. Adding images is even more crucial if you want to sell artworks or encourage people to hire you as an artist to create custom art because your customers will want to know more about the products or services that they are paying for. There are a few methods that you can use to add images.


Upload images directly as part of your blog posts. Many blogging services display an ""Add Image"" link at the top when you create a new blog post. Click your mouse on the area where you want to add an image and then use the link to select and add the image.
Create an art gallery. Websites such as Starving Artists are created in particular for artists to create galleries of their work. After signing up with such a website, you can upload images onto your gallery and add a link to your gallery page on your blog.
Make slideshows. Websites such as Kizoa and PhotoSnack let you upload images and then choose from different themes and styles to create your slideshow. The website will also give you an HTML code that you can post within the HTML of your blog where you want the slideshow to be displayed.

Common players that can run Hulu Plus on it are Apple TV, Roku Player, Amazon Fire TV, and TiVo.
You can visit this link to view the updated list of all supported devices before buying your own player (http://www.hulu.com/plus/devices).;
, Media streaming players are very easy to connect. All you need is to connect the player to your TV using an HDMI cable and you’re good to go.


For older televisions that don’t have an HDMI port, you may have to use the traditional Audio/Video cable (the cable with the red, white, and yellow jacks).

, Use your TV’s remote control and access its settings menu to change its display output to HDMI. Your TV screen should display the home screen of your player.

, Open your player and go into its “App” section from its main menu. If your player is supported, you should be able to see the Hulu Plus app. From here, all you need to do is to install it into your player—pretty much the same as how you install apps on your iOS, Android, or Windows phone—which is very easy and simple.

, After downloading the app on your media player, open it and select the video you want to watch. Hulu Plus’ interface is pretty much the same with that of its website counterpart, so it shouldn’t be foreign or hard to use.

Think this through very carefully before proceeding.,
Delete accounts.,
Weasel your way out of undeletable accounts.,
Close your personal sites.,
Check with your phone company to make sure you're not listed online.,
Cancel all mailing lists.,
Delete search engine returns that feature you.,
Stay polite.,
Consider using a professional company to remove your details from the internet.,
Cancel your email account.,
Clean up your computer.,
Shrug off what you can't remove.",How to Delete Yourself from the Internet," Much of what is suggested below cannot be undone. This means that you will lose information, forfeit any marketable presence that you've developed online, and in some cases, you'll even lose the opportunity to restart your account using the same name or even the same email address. These are drastic measures and should be treated as such.


Consider what is driving your wish to delete yourself completely. Is it a cyberstalker? Is it a single bad experience? Or are you just fed up with its pervasiveness in your life? Be sure you fully understand the issue before diving in.
Are there other ways around the problem, such as changing your online name or using a different email account from your normal one? For example, if your current email address has some unsavory online associations, can you create a separate one that you use purely for professional transactions like sending resumes, creating business profiles, etc.?
Realize that you might not even remember all the sites you've joined, created, participated in, etc.;
, As already noted, it's possible that you've joined up to more sites than you'll ever remember. The more well-known the site, however, the better it is to remove yourself from it when trying to disappear from the internet. This won't necessarily resolve ""deep web"" memory of you but it's a good start. The following list is provided to help make it easier for you to know how to start ridding yourself of the principal sites:


Delete yourself from Facebook
Delete yourself from Twitter
Delete yourself from YouTube
Delete yourself from LinkedIn
Delete yourself from Flickr
Delete yourself from StumbleUpon
Delete yourself from MySpace
Delete yourself from PayPal

Delete yourself from eBay and any other online auction sites
Delete yourself from Craigslist and any other local advertising groups.
Delete yourself from your Alma Maters (school, college, and university). Only do this if you’re no longer enrolled.
Delete yourself from game sites. Remove all your information from all game sites. Yes, that includes all the virtual items you've won and hoarded all those years. Give it away to people you know want the stuff, if the site permits it.
Close associated accounts. Associated sites, such as Hootsuite, Tweetdeck, etc., are third-party applications that helped you to use your social networking accounts. Don’t forget about these.

, Some sites don’t allow full deletion, forcing you to merely “deactivate” (while your information stays in the system) or abandon your account. If there is a real reason for removal (such as witness protection), contact the site's owner or engineers; at the very least, you should be able to get a name change to cover your real identity. However, if you can’t get anyone to intervene on your behalf, there’s another way of dissociating:


Remove every last scrap of information about yourself from the account. If leaving certain fields blank isn’t an option (or you still suspect that your info is being saved somewhere), overwrite it with clearly fake (Dingus Oppenheimer IV) or hopelessly general (John Smith) info. (There’s no need to associate some other poor sucker with your abandoned page.) Also, you may want to consider using different garbage information at each profile instead of creating one new fake profile over and over again which could be linked to you. Note that if you try to provide a different email address, the site will email it to confirm, meaning nonexistent addresses are out of the question. This brings us to the next step.
Create a new email account with a free email provider. The more unlikely the username, the better. (Ex.: jr7_9!4dkl@whatever.com. More on this in a minute.) Be sure to provide fake info here as well. Don’t close this page; if your address is as weird as it should be, you might not be able to find it again.
Associate the undeletable account with this new email address. Confirm the new email address when prompted. Once it goes through, make sure your real email address no longer appears anywhere in this account.
Cancel your new email address. Your undeletable account is now associated with an address that no longer exists. There’s always a chance that one day, someone else who has since chosen the exact username jr7_9!4dkl@whatever.com will also try to create an account with the site you’ve just dissociated from and end up very, very confused, but it probably shouldn’t keep you up nights.

, If you have created sites on the internet, you will need to remove them completely. Some of the sites you might have include:


Blogs. If you had a popular blog, keep in mind that snippets of it are probably already scattered throughout the internet. There’s nothing you can do about this.
Blogs within sites. Many sites offer blogs as part of joining; don't forget these if you have started any.
Groups like Ning, Gro.ups, Yahoo Groups, etc. Your ability to shut these down might be dependent on the participation of others.
Forum posts. This is likely to be next-to-impossible for many sites, but do your best.
Articles that you have added to article mill sites. Your ability to remove these will be dependent on the terms and conditions of those sites.

, If you are, ask them to remove your details completely. Ditto for any other customer databases that might cause your name and details to be online.

, This should be fairly straightforward as usually the method for unsubscribing is in the body of each email, often with a direct link. Follow the individual instructions given. If you can't find such instructions, contact the site administrators directly.

, Run searches on variations of your name or online name(s) to find anything you may have forgotten about and remove it manually. Remember, search engines also cache old sites, pages, and information -- including mentions of you -- that have since changed or been deleted; since it’s not in a search engine’s best interest to provide outdated results, these will generally go away by themselves with time. In some instances, however, you will need to contact search engines directly for the trickier removals. Be aware that removing yourself from search engines can be fairly detailed work that sometimes involves paperwork in the real world (ex. faxes, etc., to confirm your real identity). Major search engines and people search engines that you will probably want to look through include:


Google (read how to ungoogle yourself)
Yahoo
Bing
White Pages
US Search
Intelius
Yahoo People Search
Acxiom
People Finder
Zaba Search

, While you might be motivated by anger, fear, or irritation, don't let this come across in your tone and attitude if contacting website managers. They're human and will respond to reasonable requests couched in reasonable terms. If you're looking for a name removal because you're job searching, tell them; this at least lets them know you have a genuine reason. Avoid shouting, threatening legal action (unless you mean it, and only after they prove uncooperative), or generally being a bad sport.

, If contacting the myriad search engines one-by-one overwhelms you (and it is a very daunting prospect), you might be able to use a professional service to do the work for you. Of course, you will need to pay but it might be worth it if your reasons for removal are pressing. Look for a service that:


Is able to remove you from the ""deep web"" rather than just the obvious services.
If possible, has agreements in place with data source providers.

, If you're going to this extreme, the method for deletion will depend on whether you're using a paid-for service or a free-roaming service on the web. Be sure to hold off on deleting your email account until the end; you’ll probably need it to do most of the other steps listed here.


If free (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail, etc.), cancel following the site's instructions.
If paid for, contact the relevant company for instructions. Even web-based paid mail should have live people to contact.
Some free email accounts self-delete with lack of use.
Always check that you're not throwing away any vital information that you want to keep before you delete your account. Transfer all materials you need to a memory stick or other storage facility.

,


Remove all internet history, cookies, etc.
Remove the internet program if you're really adamant.
Remove your computer if you're going ""cold technology"".

, There may be some things that you can't do anything about. In that case, it is probably best to just accept that reality as you move on. If instances of your online come back to haunt you, you could always try denying that it's you -- especially if you have a common name! Be forewarned that the following instances of your online presence will be very hard to erase:


Mentions of you in news items, blog posts, audio files, etc.
Interviews you’ve given to newspapers, radio stations, etc.
Comments you have left here, there, and everywhere.
Photos of you in other people’s online albums.
Photos you’ve taken that have ended up on other people’s websites and blogs.
Government-sourced information that is considered appropriate to keep publicly available (except where a process is in place to remove such information).

Alternatively, you can copy the HTML code to add it to a webpage.

, Opening the account and knowing the basics of creating the survey are only half the process. The real work comes in designing an effective survey that elicits the information you're really after. This means that you need to know, without a doubt, what it is that you're seeking. Creating a survey without having a clue as to what you want from it will simply waste the time of all involved. Moreover, if it's clear to survey takers that the survey is random, they're much more likely to avoid taking it, especially if it appears as spam. When designing your surveys content, bear the following in mind:


When creating a survey, keep the questions relevant above all. Do not try to seek tangential information or those answering it will be surprised and possibly less candid.
Anonymity is a useful way to get people to respond to surveys in a candid way––provide this option unless it's absolutely essential to get names. If taking names, always advise as to how you'll maintain confidentiality of details (such as aggregating the results without mentioning individuals). If you don't think people will self-identify but you'd like them to do so, offer an incentive such as a free e-book or similar for those who provide email addresses for future correspondence, etc.
Effective survey questions tend to be: brief, simple, relevant and jargon-free. Avoid using questions that are loaded (assumption-filled) or leading (directs the answer).
Put sensitive or demographic questions at the end of the survey––a survey taker is more likely to opt out early if these appear at the front. In the same vein, ask interesting questions at the front.
Avoid cluttering up the survey. Use white space and only ask one question per line.
Test the survey before you send it live. This will allow you to find quirks and things that don't make sense. Test it on a few friends or family members to gauge their responses.

If you have any trouble accessing the site, try switching to a new browser before troubleshooting.;
, When you visit this site for the first time you'll be prompted to create an account. Fill out the information on the short form, check the box to indicate that you've read the terms of use, then click ""Register"" to proceed.


If you already have an account, click the ""Sign in"" link at the bottom.

, When you first start an account, Pandora will display a small box. Input a genre of music (rock, folk, classical) or a band you like and Pandora will make a station of similar songs. For example, if you want a station of jazz musicians similar to Miles Davis, type in his name and go from there.


As you're typing Pandora will offer suggestions. Click the name of your band, genre, or song as it appears.
You can always edit this station or create a new one later on.

, Pandora will analyze your suggestion and play similar songs, allowing you to find new music and create playlists instantly based on your input. For example, if you suggest ""The Rolling Stones,"" Pandora will create a playlist based on ""classic rock, blues influences, guitar solos, and high energy,"" featuring songs by Cream, The Who, the Beatles, and more.


Pandora does not play whatever song you want. Instead, it takes your suggestion and uses it to make a customized playlist. , Pandora edits your playlist on the fly if you tell it what you enjoy. So if you ""thumb-up"" lots of songs by Aretha Franklin you'll not only get more Aretha songs but more strong-voiced female soul singers, like Dinah Washington and Etta James.

, Pandora does give you some control over the song you're listening to via the buttons at the top of the window. Aside from volume control, you can pause songs, skip them, or remove them from your playlist.

Next: Skips to the next song in your playlist. Unlike ""thumbs down,"" skipping a song simply passes it without telling Pandora to adjust your preferences.

I'm Tired of this Track: Click this for songs you enjoy, but have heard one too many times. Pandora will remember this and take it out of your playlists for several months.

, Underneath your chosen station on the left-hand side of the screen is an ""add variety"" button. Clicking it allows you to tweak your station to be more specific.


For example, if you had a station of folk music, but wanted some more bluegrass influences, you might add in ""Ralph Stanley,"" ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?' Soundtrack,"" or even the genre ""Bluegrass.""

, When you want to listen to a different kind of music, click the button in the top left with a ""+"" sign and the words ""Create Station."" Type in another artist, song, genre, etc. and select it from the list. Songs that are similar to your query will start playing.


If you specify an artist, the first song in the playlist will be from that artist. After this, the songs will be from similar artists with the original artist sprinkled in.
Click the station buttons on the left to switch between them.

, Pandora's music license limits the amount of songs users can skip per hour. If you have a free account, you can only skip six songs per hour, per station. However, you may not skip more than 24 songs per day. If you want to hear different music you must make a new station or wait for the time limit to end.This limit is affected whether you use the ""Next"" button, the ""Thumbs down"" button, or the ""I'm tired of this track"" option.

You can't switch songs.,
You can't change stations.,
Pandora won't play on your computer.,
Your Pandora app won't work.,
You can't hear Pandora.",How to Use Pandora4," Pandora is very strict with their 6-skips rule. If you've skipped 6 songs in one hour, per station. You cannot skip or thumbs-down a song on the same playlist after you've reached your six-song limit.

, In addition to the 6-skips limit per hour, there is a 24 song skip limit every 24-hours. This limit is for all stations -- so if your skip 6 songs in an hour on 4 different stations you will not be able to skip another song until the next day.

, Make sure you have a reliable internet connection by navigating to another page. If your internet is working, but Pandora is not, try the following ideas:


Restart your web browser
Try a new web browser (ie. switch from Safari to FireFox)
Disable your pop-up protection.
Disable any adblocker software.

Clear your cache and cookies., Transmitting music wirelessly takes up a lot of data, so the biggest problem from mobile users is a slow connection. Connect your phone to wi-fi if possible, and make sure you have a strong cell connection you can't. Other troubleshooting solutions include:


Check the App Store/Google Play for Pandora updates by searching for the app and clicking on it.
Download the latest mobile software updates. Plug your phone into your computer to make sure it is up to date.
Delete the app and then re-install if from your app store.

, Make sure the volume on your phone or computer is turned up, then check the small volume slider above your song. Make sure it is not all the way to the left. Oftentimes, accidentally clicking on this volume slider mutes Pandora.


Click and drag the slider to the right to turn up the volume.

Don’t reveal too much: Each website provides different levels of privacy settings to control access to your profile page and your interaction with others.,
Beware of spam messages: It could be an e-mail pretending to be from someone you know, addressing you by your first name and mentioning the names of your children.,
Educate yourself: As social networking sites and chat rooms are especially attractive to children and teenagers, it is essential that parents educate them about safe online behavior and keep tabs on what they are doing online.

,
Maintain a good reputation: It’s worth remembering that whatever you post on your profile page, or other community forum, remains in the public sphere long after you log out of the web site.",How to Be Safe on Social Networking Sites," Identity theft is a major industry on the Internet and information extracted from social networking sites is used by criminals to spam e-mails and for targeted attacks on specific individuals and companies, using sophisticated social engineering techniques.;
, It does not look like a spam message and it can trick you into revealing even more sensitive information. Similar methods are also used to gain financial information from businesses.

,, This includes the crazy stuff and wild photos that you posted on Facebook but decided to delete ten minutes later because it suddenly seemed like a bad idea. The problem is that you can’t really retract it. Once it’s out there on the Web, you have little control over who copies the material, where it is used and how widely it gets distributed.

Sign out.",How to Be Invisible Online1," Every browser has an Incognito feature that disables your browser or other websites from getting your browsing information, such as the sites you frequently visit, your username, and even passwords.


Open your browser’s menu and inside you’ll find its Incognito feature. Developers make this feat easy to access by making it readily available to users that are not tech-savvy.;
, If you’re using chat programs like Skype or Facebook Messenger, you can adjust the settings of these programs to set your chat availability as “Invisible.” This means that while you’re still online, people who have you in their contact lists will see you as not available or offline.


You can still receive their messages, but you don’t have to respond right away.
Like Incognito, this feature is also very easy to use and access. It’s commonly located on your account profile, chat window, or beside the message text field of the chat application you’re using.

, If you can’t use an Invisible feature, sign out completely. If the chat application you’re using—by any chance—doesn’t give you the option to go invisible, just sign out from it completely. Hit the “Log out” button to go offline. You’ll still be receiving messages and can read them later anyway.

Use them for day-to-day Internet use., Some search engines say they don’t track or store user or search information. This is a big change from Google, who perfected behavioral marketing based on your search history.

, It allows you to create disposable email addresses and passwords. Then you can sign up for the option to use temporary credit card numbers, so that the website can’t find out your personal information and the credit card company can’t trace your purchase to you.


This service costs $5 per month.
Go to www.abine.com/maskme.

, If you assume that employers, scammers or the government can read anything you post on social media or send via email, then it’s easier to rein in the information you give to others. People who avoid excessive posting and communication will have an easier time maintaining anonymity.


If you must use social media sites, like Facebook, adjust your privacy controls to the strictest settings, so that your information isn’t shown to a network of people who don’t already know you.

, If you use Google Chrome, only open the “Incognito Window,” which doesn’t track cookies. If you use Firefox, adjust the setting to “Do Not Track.”


MaskMe also has a Chrome ad-on.
Ensure you delete your temporary Internet files, history and cookies regularly for extra security.
Consider installing the add-on called “HTTPS Everywhere.” Created by EFF.org, it forces your browser to only use HTTPS URLs which use encryption to make them more secure. The “S” stands for “Secure.”, This is a way of connecting to a private network from a public one, with all information being encrypted between the two computers. You can add a new network and select “Virtual Private Network” as the type.


You will be asked to use the IP address of a remote computer and a key that changes frequently.
Consider signing up for a VPN service or using third-party VPN software, like Comodo. Make sure you are using an outgoing VPN, rather than signing up for an incoming VPN, which will give another computer access to your computer., If you have never searched for yourself on Google, Reputation.com or RemoveYourName.com can search for you, find instances of your name popping up and remove them if you choose.

, Mozilla Thunderbird is one service that can be set up to encrypt all emails, so that versions of your email aren’t stored on servers as they make their way to your recipient., Signing up for a paid proxy server will mean that your IP address is hidden whenever you use the Internet. Combine that with a MaskMe profile, a VPN and encrypted email and you are much less likely to be tracked online.

, If you drive an expensive car or tell people about your purchases, you are likely to attract attention., Surveys will ask how much you make, and they can sell that information to other companies. This information can be accessed by people looking to steal your identity or send you financial offers.

, If paperwork must be filed, thousands of financial institutions will find out about your mortgage and be able to reach you with offers.

, Use a service like MaskMe if you frequently make purchases online.


Consider using a Doing Business As (DBA) for all companies and an alias for financial transactions. Although this information must be advertised in a local paper, you are placing at least one smoke screen between your name and your financial information.

, If you sign up for a change of address with the US Postal Service, the government does not report your new address with the National Change of Address database. You have six months to one year to change all important address documents to a post office box, while credit card companies, catalogs and institutions will no longer be able to reach you directly.

, You can go to their websites and sign up to stop credit card companies and financial institutions from being able to access your credit score or history. You set up a PIN so that you can thaw your credit if you need to use it in the future.


Freezing your credit means that you can’t apply for any loans. It is best done when you are not looking to sign up for credit accounts.
Freezing your credit may be the best course of action against ID theft., Although this is difficult, you will be harder to track if you don’t sign up for utilities or have a physical address. Living off the grid requires a huge initial investment, often costing several hundred thousand dollars to build a house with its own energy systems.

Use proxy servers.,
Use mock email accounts.,
Restrict your social networking activities.,
Create fake accounts.",How to Be Invisible Online2," Proxy servers are computers or programs in a network that act as gateway to a larger network, like the Internet. When you connect to the net using servers, your computer’s digital identity can be hidden from the sites you visit.


To use this, open your browser’s connection settings and enter the address of the proxy server you like to use. Your web browser will connect to the Internet using this server as gateway.

, Email addresses, just like phone numbers, are very personal. Yet almost all services available on the Internet require you to give out your email address before you can use their services. If you can’t avoid giving out your email address, create one that you can give away.


The mock email accounts don’t have to be completely personal, just sign up for one that you can access anytime when needed (like account activation and such).

, Limit the number of posts you make a day on social networking sites. Facebook and Twitters both have features that can display your current location together with the statuses you post.


Avoid posting pictures or videos where you currently are. If you simply can’t resist sharing these things with people, post pictures after you come home from your trip.

, Using fake identities can greatly help you be invisible while you’re on the Internet. Create fake accounts on social networking sites or sites you frequently visit.


You don’t have to pretend to be someone by copying their identity. Just use whatever name that comes into your mind and grab random pictures from the Internet, just enough for your fake account to have some contents.

Wait for your browser to finish downloading.",How to Choose an Internet Browser," Most computing devices, mobile or otherwise, come with a built-in browser (for example, Macs come with Safari pre-installed) which is optimized for that particular device. In addition to this, there are a few device-specific browsers which cannot be used on other types of devices:


Mac computers, Windows computers older than Windows 10 and all mobile devices outside of Windows Phone 10 in general cannot use Microsoft Edge (the exception being mobile Windows platforms). Internet Explorer was once available for Mac but has become so old that Mac is no longer supporting it's super-early version on the Mac.
Windows computers and Android devices cannot use Safari. However, there is a Safari for Windows software available from Apple that's available if you look harder after downloading it from the web here.
iOS devices (e.g., iPhones, iPods, and iPads) cannot use the built-in Android browser.;
, Since most browsers stop working on outdated operating systems, you'll need to know your device's operating system number to determine whether or not your device is eligible for a new browser. To find the operating system number:



Mac - Click the Apple icon in the top-left corner of the screen, click About This Mac, and look at the ""Version"" number below the OS name at the top of the window.

Windows - Click the ""Start"" icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, type in ""msinfo32"", and look at the ""Version"" number near the top of the page.

iPhone - Open Settings, tap General, tap About, and look at the number next to ""Version"".

Android - Open Settings, tap About phone or About tablet at the bottom of the page, and look for the number next to ""Android version"".

, Based on your devices' operating systems, look at the following browsers and determine which ones will work for you:



Internet Explorer - Internet Explorer is a discontinued browser for Windows computers that you can still find on older versions of Windows. While IE is slower and less secure than other browser on this list, it may be your only option if you're using an outdated operating system (e.g., Windows XP), since most modern browsers have moved on to support only newer operating systems.

Microsoft Edge - Comes pre-installed on Windows 10 computers. Interfaces with Cortana, which is Microsoft's virtual assistant. Edge is a much quicker and simpler alternative to Internet Explorer, although the lack of add-ons and rich customization options can be a deal breaker.

Safari - Comes pre-installed on Macs and iOS devices. Safari interfaces perfectly with features such as Siri and Spotlight search, and you can synchronize your bookmarks between your Mac and your iPhone, iPad, or iPod.

Chrome - Requires iOS 9.0 or later (iPhone), MacOS X 10.9 or later, or Windows 7 64-bit or later. Android operating systems vary. Google Chrome is an incredibly fast browser with numerous add-ons that can help you personalize your browsing experience. You can also log into Google Chrome with a Google account to synchronize your bookmarks and settings across multiple devices.

Firefox - Requires iOS 9.0 or later (iPhone), Android 4.0.3 or later, MacOS X 10.9 or later, or Window 7 or later. Firefox functions similarly to Chrome, though much of Firefox's emphasis is on privacy. Like Chrome, you can sign into Firefox to synchronize your browser across any device. If you don't adore Google but want a similar experience to Chrome, you should use Firefox.

Opera - Requires iOS 7.0 or later (iPhone), Mac OS X 10.9 or later, or Windows 7 or later. Opera is great for lower-end computers with less memory than is optimal for Chrome or Firefox, since Opera can compress pages to load them quickly without consuming enough memory to slow down your computer. It is also available for lower versions of iOS and Android OS than are Firefox and Chrome.

, Since you now know which browsers are compatible with your device(s), compare their features:


If you want to prioritize speed and/or you rely on Google for most of your browsing needs, use Google Chrome.
If privacy is your foremost concern, Firefox is a good browser choice.
If you're trying to minimize the impact that your browser has on your computer's running speed, try Opera.

, Keep in mind that you can always download multiple browsers for testing purposes. Now that you've decided on a browser (or multiple browsers), it's time to download and install your browser.

, Naturally, this site will vary:


For Google Chrome, go to https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html.
For Firefox, go to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/desktop/.
For Opera, go to http://www.opera.com/download.

, The button you'll click to download your selected browser will also vary from browser to browser, both in appearance and location:



Chrome - Click the blue Download Chrome button below the banner that's at the top of the page.

Firefox - Click the green Download button in the middle of the page.

Opera - Click the green Download now button on the left side of the page.

, Doing so will prompt the browser's setup file to begin downloading to your computer.


You may first have to select a download location, depending on your current browser.

, Most browser setup files only take a few minutes to download, though this process may vary depending on your Internet connection speed.

, If the file downloaded to your desktop, you'll see it represented by your selected browser's icon there; otherwise, you may first have to open your computer's ""Downloads"" folder, which can be accomplished by typing ""Downloads"" into Spotlight (Mac) or the Start menu (Windows) and then clicking the top option.

, Typically, this process will consist of verifying that you have read and accepted the terms and conditions of use, clicking Next a few times, and waiting for your browser to install to your desktop.


By default, all browsers will install a desktop shortcut that resembles the browser's logo.
Make sure you read each page of the setup process so that you don't inadvertently install a program you don't want.
Some browsers will install a toolbar or an antivirus program by default which, while supposedly helpful, you may not want; you can uncheck these options to prevent them from being installed.

, It should be on your desktop once the installation completes. Doing so will open your new browser.

, It's a blue app with a white ""A"" made from writing utensils on it. You'll likely find this app on the Home Screen.


This process will work the same way for an iPad or an iPod touch as well.

, This magnifying glass-shaped icon is at the bottom of the screen.

, It's at the top of the screen.

, As you type, you'll see search suggestions appear below the ""Search"" bar.

, Doing so will search the App Store for the corresponding browser.

, You may have to scroll down to view the browser you wish to install.

, It's the blue button to the right of your browser.

, This green button will appear in the same place as was GET. Doing so will prompt your browser to begin downloading, though you may first need to enter your Apple ID password.


If you have Touch ID enabled on your iPhone, you may be prompted to scan your fingerprint instead of entering an Apple ID password.

, This app is white with a multicolored triangle on it. You'll find Play Store in the App Drawer, which is accessible by tapping the grid of dots at the bottom of the Home Screen.

, It's in the top-right corner of the screen.

, This will search the Play Store for your browser.


For example, you might type ""Google Chrome"" or ""Firefox"" into the search bar.

, Doing so will take you to the browser's app page.

, This will be in the top-right side of the screen.

, It's at the bottom of the pop-up menu. Doing so will prompt your browser to begin downloading to your Android.

, Once it does, you can tap OPEN on the right side of the screen to directly open your browser.

When the wall outlet isn't the reason for a Dell Inspiron notebook battery pack charging inability, the following troubleshooting suggestions may help you.

,
See if the AC adapter is damaged or not.,
Try another battery.,
See whether the issue is the result of a software program.,
Energy reset the system by disconnecting it and detaching the battery.,
Recalibrate the battery.",How to Troubleshoot a Dell Inspiron 1545 Battery That Doesn't Charge2,", Remove the battery power from your notebook and switch on the laptop or computer using the energy plug connected. If your Inspiron notebook doesn't switch on, use an additional energy adapter to confirm whether your first one is malfunctioning. If your second trial doesn't work too, the problem may be the power circuit on the motherboard. Search for a licensed PC technician to help you solve the problem.

, If your Dell 1545 laptop or computer does switch on and your power adapter is in great condition and not the reason for the problem, try putting another Dell Inspiron 1545 Battery in. You must use one that fits the technical specs of the notebook, to make it suitable for testing. If the second battery is useful, it is probably that the first one is actually malfunctioning.

, If your laptop battery condition isn't being shown properly though a software program, it may be that the program is causing the problem and not the electric battery.

, Right after carrying out that, hold that power key down for 60 seconds. After that, connect the Dell electric battery and energy adapter, and launch the notebook again. This might fix the particular charging failure of your battery pack.

, When the Dell Inspiron Battery ceases charging each time the charge sign gets to 96-98%, your notebook should be recalibrated for a fresh battery. For suitable laptop recalibration, the Windows energy management ought to be set up to stop the device from going into sleep mode or hibernation once the battery pack gets to a very low level. If you carry out this out procedure, exhaust the battery completely until the Dell 1545 laptop system turns off. Once discharged completely, place the adapter into the energy jack and allow it to charge entirely. At times the cycle should be repeated 2-3 times just before it really gets to the 100% complete charge. The actual charging procedure ought to last at a minimum around fourteen hours.

Use this method only if you are competent with electronics.

,
Note that the connector coming from the PSU has actually three pins: outer sleeve (0v), inner sleeve (20v) and center pin (5v).,
If your computer works when connected to the power supply but the battery won't charge, use a multimeter to measure the voltage on the center pin, being careful not to short it with the 20v inner sleeve (use a short piece of a plastic straw to act as an intermediate insulator sleeve).,
Disconnect the power supply from the wall.,
If you find the wire which connects to the center pin is broken, re-solder it.",How to Troubleshoot a Dell Inspiron 1545 Battery That Doesn't Charge3,", Without the 5v on the center pin, the computer works but the battery won't charge.

, If it shows 5v, the problem is something else. If it shows much less than 5v, this might be the problem.

, Cut the insulator plastic which covers your connector using a sharp object such as an Exacto knife, being careful not to cut very deep or you'll damage the wires.

, If it's not broken, measure its voltage. It should show 5v. If it does not show 5v, the wire might be broken somewhere along the cable or the 5v circuit inside the PSU is dead.

Work in the shade.,
Wear sunglasses.A pair of polarized sunglasses can do wonders for your vision in the sun.,
Wear a darker shirt.,
Get under a sheet or towel.",How to Make Laptop Screens Readable Outdoors2," Either find a spot under a tree, or set up a large beach umbrella. Not only will this make your laptop screen easier to see, but it'll also keep your laptop from overheating (especially if it's black). If you'd rather keep your body in the sun, keep only the laptop in the shade, and wear a hat with a brim to keep the sun from shining right in your eyes.

, Plus, sunglasses make you look cool. When shopping for sunglasses, choose amber lenses to increase contrast and make details more clear. If given the option, upgrade to glasses that have anti-reflective coating on the front and back of the lens to effectively reduce sun glare.

, If you’re wearing a white shirt, you’ll see its reflection in the screen. Switching to a black shirt will reduce that glare more than you'd expect.

Buy a “rugged” or “outdoors” laptop.",How to Make Laptop Screens Readable Outdoors3," Those with a glossy finish might look nicer indoors, but they'll reflect the sun all too well if you take them outside. Matte-screen laptops are few and far between these days, but you may have luck finding a used or refurbished model.

, Now that glossy screens outnumber the matte, your options may appear limited. But not all screens are created equal—even some glossy screens have design enhancements that make them perform well in the sun. When deciding between different glossy-screened laptops, look for keywords in the advertisements/descriptions like “Outdoor View,” “I/O,” “Indoor/Outdoor,” or “Enhanced Outdoor.”

, Some laptops with outdoor-friendly screens also have other features beneficial for outdoor use, such as a thick chassis that protects your laptop if it drops. These laptops nearly always have the word “rugged” or “outdoor” in their product names. Some of these laptops are even waterproof. Search online for reviews of these models, or drop by your local computer store to ask for recommendations.

Depending on the type of docking station you're using, it may also be possible to connect your laptop while it's open and running, but if you're using a separate monitor, this can sometimes be distracting. If necessary, expose the docking slot on the back of your laptop. There are two basic kinds of docking stations: horizontal ones that look like a small, squarish block or pad, and slanted ones that look like an elevated book stand. The first type of docking station almost always connects to a slot on the bottom rear of the laptop, so if you're using this sort of docking station, check the back of your laptop to make sure this slot is open.
Note that, if you have a book stand-type docking station you may not need to do this. These types of docking stations often have more traditional cable inputs.;
, Next, set the laptop on the docking station, lining up any pegs on the docking station with the appropriate slots on the back of the laptop. See below for more information:


For horizontal ""block""-style docking stations, line up the port on the back rear of the laptop with the plug on the docking station. Press down to slide the plug into the port.
For ""book stand""-type docking stations, simply set your laptop in the stand facing forward. Usually, you there won't be any plugs or ports you need to line up — these types of docking stations mostly use cables.

, If you're using a docking station that requires a cable to connect to the laptop (or you have a laptop with a port that doesn't match the station's plug), simply connect the cable from the station to the laptop as you would with any sort of peripheral device (like a monitor, keyboard, etc.)


Most modern cable-based docking stations use either USB 3.0 or USB 2.0 cables. However, exceptions exist, so check your instruction manual if you're unsure.

, Once your laptop is connected to your docking station, it should be relatively easy to connect any peripheral devices you wish to use to the docking station. Simply connect these as if you were connecting them to a desktop or laptop computer itself. Devices that most docking stations support include:


Monitor (via standard pin port or HDMI cable)
Keyboard (via USB)
Mouse (via USB)
Modem/router (via Ethernet cable)
Printer (varies)Note: If you're not using a monitor, keyboard, or mouse, simply open your laptop and use its screen/keys/touchpad as you normally would.

, Once your laptop and your peripherals are all routed through the docking station, they should be ready for use. However, the very first time you use your docking station, your computer may need to install new device drivers so that it can interface with the hardware properly. This process should begin automatically. Allow these drivers to install completely before using your laptop.

, It's easy to forget that docking stations themselves require power just like all of the other devices at your desk. If you can't seem to get your docking station to do anything, quickly check to make sure that its power cord is securely connected to an outlet.


Many modern docking stations will also have a small light to indicate they are receiving power.

, In cases where some of the peripherals attached to a docking station seem to work but others don't, the problem may be with the malfunctioning device's connections. Check to make sure each peripheral is firmly plugged into the proper port on the docking station.


In rare cases where your devices' plugs have accumulated too much dust to register with the docking station, you may need to gently clean. Try using compressed air or a computer-safe cloth to clean away any dust or gunk and reconnecting.You may also want to try using a cotton swab dampened with rubbing alcohol or commercial electronics cleaning solution for clearing external plugs., Usually, when you connect a new device (like a docking station) to your computer, it will automatically be detected and the computer will install drivers (files that allow the computer to use the device properly). However, in rare cases, the computer may have difficulty finding or installing drivers on its own. If this happens, your docking station may not function, so you'll need to download and install the appropriate drivers yourself.


Drivers are usually available for free download from the manufacturer's website. Most modern computers also have the ability to locate drivers online on their own (see our article on installing drivers for more information.)

, As a very general rule, if your docking station physically connects to your laptop, there's a good chance that it will be compatible. However, this isn't always the case. If you can't seem to get your laptop to interact with your docking station, there's a chance that it simply isn't built to be compatible. Try looking up the model name of your docking station on its manufacturer's website — you should be able to find compatibility information on its product page.


If you don't have a model name for your docking station, try looking for the product number on the device. Usually, this is on a service tag sticker somewhere on the back or bottom., While other charging cords may fit into the plug on your docking station, it's not advisable to use them in place of the original cord. Different cords are rated for different amounts of electric current — using the wrong charger can potentially damage your docking station's circuitry (either over time or immediately.)


If you lose your original charging cord, try talking to the staff at a local electronics store before buying a replacement. Most trained electronics professionals will be able to help you find a charger that's safe to use with your docking station.

, If all else fails, you can still usually get much of the same functionality that you'd get from a docking station by simply connecting all of your peripherals to the laptop itself. Unfortunately, this method has two disadvantages:


It can lead to a disorderly bunch of cords that takes time and effort to untangle every time you connect or disconnect the laptop (this is the situation that the docking station is designed to prevent.)
Not all laptops will have the proper ports for every peripheral.

Read the entire article, and check that your specific laptop can be repaired in the way presented.,
Cut two strips of the fuzzy Velcro and round the corners (rounding the corners will make it less likely that the Velcro will detach after gluing).

,
Read the instructions for the epoxy glue; mix it and use it to glue the two strips of fuzzy Velcro, one on the back of the display, and one on the bottom of the laptop, such that the two strips are co-linear (in other words, the alignment of one strip, when extended, coincides with the alignment of the other strip).,
Wait for the epoxy glue to harden fully.,
Close the laptop display, and cut a strip of the hooked Velcro more or less to the length required when sticking it to the two glued strips in their entirety.,
After the glue has hardened to maximum strength, check that the Velcro can now prevent the display from falling into the closed position.,
Take the fishing line, and tie it into a loop which exactly encircles the laptop when the display is open to the working position.,
Check that the fishing line loop is strong enough to prevent the display from falling into the fully open position (fishing line comes in a variety of strengths, use a relatively strong line which will not stretch under the load).

,
Glue a small strip of two-sided foam tape (like used for mounting things) on the edge of the laptop where the fishing line should rest.,
Optionally, you can use a plastic bag closure which has been notched (see images), in order to more easily adjust the exact size of the fishing line loop (and therefore, the exact working position of the laptop display).

",How to Workaround Damaged Laptop Display Hinges," Especially check that the fishing line can be placed in a location which doesn't get too much in the way of your normal use (heavy users of the mouse buttons or touchpad might have problems here), and that there are locations more or less in the center of the laptop where gluing the Velcro will not affect the use of the laptop (that no access doors or ventilation holes are sealed).;
,, Try to make the line of the two strips be as perpendicular as possible to the axis of the display hinges.

, This can take 24 hours or even more. See the instructions for the particular epoxy you have used. Don't confuse the setting time of the epoxy (which can be as quick as 5 minutes) with the time until it reaches maximum strength.

, Actually, what is more important is that the length of the hooked strip totally utilize the glued strips when the laptop display is open. Do not use the Velcro with an open display before the glue has hardened to its maximum strength.

, Laptops with large or heavy displays may require gluing multiple strips of Velcro, or wider and/or stronger Velcro (Velcro comes in a range of sizes and bonding strengths). The laptop in the images has a 12.1"" display.

, I used an ""improved blood knot"" for this. Instructions can be found in various places on the Internet.

Report incidents of flashing to Chatroulette.",How to Avoid Flashers on Chatroulette," Chatroulette is a relatively new phenomenon and one which apparently proves irresistible to some exhibitionists who can't keep themselves from exposing more than anybody else wants to see. The anonymity of the feature encourages a ""trenchcoat-wearing subway flasher"" mentality for some (mainly) men.Being prepared for the possibility and being ready to disconnect is probably your best defense.


If you don't want to risk it, perhaps the best solution is not to use Chatroulette at all.;
, Make up your own mind whether or not you think Chatroulette's handling of the problem is sufficient enough to quell your concerns.


The site is using face recognition software to try to cut or censor any instances of non-face appearances. A warning also goes off for the site managers if a user is being constantly skipped, presumably enabling them to deal with it promptly.
The site has added a site notice informing all users that it is against US and UN law to expose themselves to minors and that the Chatroulette site is cooperating with law enforcement agencies., In addition to the above attempts to remove flashers, Chatroulette has added new channels - some ""adult-themed"" channels and a local dating channel.


Avoid the adult-themed channels if you don't want to risk flashers. Flashers are more likely to be using them.
Use the local dating stream for dating conversation and a decreased likelihood of flashers. Theoretically, people looking for a date will be doing so in earnest rather than considering exposing themselves!
None of this is foolproof. A flasher will go wherever a flasher feels like, so remain vigilant for moving on as fast as possible!

, If anything unsavory starts occurring on your screen, go to someone else who isn't abusing the chat, or switch it off altogether.

, For some, especially children, it isn't pleasant seeing somebody exposing themselves, or images depicting graphic violence and can be extremely troubling. If you experience shock, anxiety, panic, disgust, etc. after seeing a flasher, it is important to work through your upset. Find someone you can trust to talk to, whether it be another family member, a friend, a counselor, or someone else whom you feel safe talking with.


Try to keep it in perspective by realizing that such people are mentally unhealthy and this isn't meant as a personal attack on you. You're an anonymous victim.
If you find flashing is happening to you frequently when on Chatroulette, seriously consider not using Chatroulette at all.

, This will enable the site managers to track down the IP and other details in an attempt to have the offender caught and dealt with by law enforcement officials. The more that people understand that this is a high likelihood, the less tempted they will be to try.

Browse for the file you want.",How to Recover Deleted Files from Your Computer1," The Recycle Bin will hold files before deleting them, allowing you to restore them to your computer if you change your mind. To restore a file, open the Recycle Bin, right-click on the file, and select Restore. The file will be returned to its original location on the hard drive.


Large files may be permanently deleted instead of being sent to the Recycle Bin.;
, If your files are not found in the Recycle Bin, don’t save or delete anything from your computer. Your chances of recovering the file are much higher if you don’t save anything new. This is because when a file is deleted, it is actually just set to be overwritten. If no new data has overwritten the original file, then it can usually be recovered.

, Make sure that you don’t save it to the drive that you need to recover a file from, or you may overwrite the file you need to recover. Some of the more popular free programs include:


Recuva
Restoration
Glary Undelete
Puran File Recovery
Download a portable version of the recovery program if possible, so that you can run it directly from a USB drive without needing to install it. Not all file recovery programs offer portable versions., While every program is different, they all follow the same basic steps. Make sure that you don’t install the program to the same drive that you are trying to recover from.

, Point the recovery program at the disk that the file was on when it was deleted. You can also recover files from a USB drive this way. Most recovery programs will ask what type of file you are searching for. You can also specify the file name, or get a list of all recoverable files to browse through., Some programs will give you the option to perform a deep scan while looking for files. This will take significantly longer, but may result in more files found.

, Once the scan has returned results, look through the list to see if your file was recovered. Different programs will have different methods for recovery, but in general you just need to select your file and click the Restore button.


Not all files will be 100% recoverable. This is because files are often stored in multiple parts of your hard drive, and one part of the file may have been overwritten.
Some programs restore the file to its original location, others will restore it to a Recovery folder.

Data Rescue
FileSalvage
Boomerang
There are very few free options when it comes to OS X data recovery software.

, Some data recovery programs come with a bootable image that bypasses the OS X operating system. Booting from this image may allow your data recovery software to find more files.


Insert the bootable disc into your Mac.
Restart the computer while holding the C key.
Hold the C key until the Apple logo appears. Your computer will load directly into the data recovery program.

, In order for Mac recovery software to work, you will need to attach a USB drive, or designate a separate internal drive. If you are connecting an external drive, make sure that it is at least a USB 2.0, USB 3.0, or Firewire device, as USB 1.0 will result in much slower processing.


The connected drive should have at least 2% of the target drive’s storage space.

, You will be asked to choose where you want to scan for files, so be sure to choose the hard drive that the files were originally located on. You will also typically be given an option between a Quick scan or a Deep/Full scan.


A Quick scan will find most of the files that can be recovered, and the process is usually fairly quick. It is recommended that you try a Quick scan first.
A Deep scan will find more files than a Quick scan, but takes significantly longer to perform. For large hard drives and slow computers, a Deep scan could take over a day to complete.

, Once the scan is finished running, you will be presented with a list of files that can be recovered. Use the Preview option to ensure that the file is completely intact before marking it for Recovery.


File names will often be changed from their original because their filer structure was destroyed during the delete process.
Many files will not be recoverable, because parts of the file have been overwritten.

, If you are attempting to recover a large number of files, try recovering only the most essential files first. This will help ensure that your most important files stay uncorrupted. The recovered files will be copied to the recovery drive that you plugged in before starting. "

Check if you have a recovery partition.,
If you can't fix the problem.",How to Reboot a Crashed Windows Computer," Try to figure out what caused the crash. This can sometimes be found by running windows in safe mode then opening Windows Log Files, or if there's a blue screen, you can see the problem written after the memory index (like: ffff01230x230) . To open Windows Logs, follow these steps:


Click the Start button, and then click Control Panel.

Double-click Computer Management.;
, In some cases, computer failure is the result of inadequate power supply or an electrical short-circuit.


Restart your computer then double check the connections.
Reconnect all cords and wires, and try to restart the computer.

, Minor hardware driver errors or other software bugs that relate to sensitive processes or hardware may also contribute to a computer crash. This can be done from ""Add/Remove Programs"" under Control Panel. You can also Do a System Restore, which can automatically restore programs, drivers, and other system software to a previous, stable state without deleting any user files or other important data.

, Windows operating system has an option that includes several fail-safe menu for repairing boot problems. Access Last Known Good Configuration and other options by pressing F8 before reaching the log on screen.

, XP operating systems have a Safe Mode option which allows the computer to run in a limited state. (Access Safe Mode and other options by pressing F8 before reaching the log on screen.)

, Boot the PC using a repair CD or Operating System installation disc. Most operating system installation discs are bootable (or, have an OS of their own), allowing one to start their computer via the CD/DVD. Oftentimes, these discs can fix problems that are preventing the PC from starting correctly. They can also be used to access System Restore and other helpful features. This is only recommended if you know what you are doing.

, Some computers have a recovery partition(usually the ones which comes pre-installed with an operating system). The way to access it varies between computers. Your best guess would be Alt-F10 pressed repeatedly right after pressing the power button to turn it on. Be warned, however, that re-installing the Operating System will result in a total loss of any documents or other data stored on the computer.

, If all else fails, take the computer to a computer technician or repairman.

Ask yourself how essential each and every update actually is.,
Ask for help if you need it.,
Stop and smell the roses.",How to Avoid Social Media Burnout," Even a sneaking feeling that you're overdoing the social media connections each day might be enough to help you realize a change is needed to your current approach. However, it's not always self-evident that you're enmeshed so deeply as to be harming both yourself and potentially the ""brand"" you're putting across to others. Be particularly alert to possible burnout where you've been making excuses to yourself for pushing beyond your available time and energy, making room for social media at the expense of the rest of your life. Be clear that passion and obsession are not the same thing, and that being obsessed with inputting social media updates will eventually wear you down. Here are some signs that you might already be suffering from social media burnout:


You're plugged in to social media for most of the day and all of the evening, yet it doesn't feel very productive at all. Moreover, you find it hard to disengage even though you keep telling yourself that you must. To a lesser or greater extent, you may also realize that you've confused the quality and quantity equation.
Apathy or lethargy sets in. For example, when once your first thoughts turned to social media interaction, now it seems like an ugly chore looming over you, as if you've created a monster of necessity that needs feeding even though you'd rather forget about it. You may already be avoiding networking as much as possible.
You've become abrupt and possibly even rude with your messaging. This is the online equivalent of real life snapping at others, or acting defensively before anything is even explained.
You're in a rut of the same-same-same old stuff. You simply keep on recycling what worked this time last year without giving a toss that this year's approach has changed direction. You've… just… stopped… caring.
You feel pulled in many different directions and it's a huge source of stress. Yet, stepping off this treadmill feels threatening.
You've simply decided to disappear. You've gone missing in action, totally disappeared from your favorite social media accounts and you can't even be bothered to respond to those kind messages asking after your well-being. And people have stopped wondering about you at all––you've been written off.
And if social media is part of your job or business, you may be asking yourself: ""What work/life balance?"" If your social media input has bled into your offline life to the point where you're updating while cooking, changing diapers or taking money out of the ATM, it's definitely time to reassess your direction!;
, Accept that your involvement needs revitalizing. Switch off and go and do something you love to bring back some sparkle into your life, such as taking a weekend trip away, starting a weekly sport or getting involved in a new hobby. Whatever it is, adding a little fun diversion into your real life will help to restore your creativity and give you a bit of space. Use this time to put social media ""on hold"" and simply enjoy the moment without trying to see an angle in it for updating or posting purposes. When you do get back to deciding on your new social media approach, having experienced a few unrelated distractions will improve your sense of connection with people and the world, often making it easier to find fresh motivation to reconnect.

, Social media is usually delivered at a fast pace. Getting caught up in this pace can be a major cause of wearing you down, and most likely it's because you haven't set yourself precise boundaries as to when you will and won't interact. If you're a people-pleaser type personality or someone who just can't bear the thought of letting down anyone, you're at high risk of burnout both now and into the future unless you put in place secure boundaries for your usage of social media. Even if that's not your personality type, the frequent pressure to ""be the best in social media"" can create unwarranted pressure to perform like crazy. It is therefore recommended that you make a pros and cons list of your involvement to try to restore a sense of what truly matters when you use social media:


Write down the things that you find frustrating, boring, challenging, time-consuming, exhausting and petty about your social media input.
After identifying the negatives, write down the things you love about social media input, such as connecting, sharing information, energizing action, growing a cause or interest group, knowing people are learning from you and vice versa, etc.
Mull over your two lists and see what actually matters to you and where you feel most stretched and most engaged. By doing this, you can begin to concentrate on how to improve the mix in future.

, Start by looking at the extent of your social media accounts. Do you have too many perhaps? With so many possibilities including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Foursquare, and more, it can easily be a case of stretching yourself too thinly. Which ones are most important or valuable to you? Which ones will give you the most mileage for what it is you're using social media for? The answers to these questions will differ depending on whether you're interacting for fun, for a business or job, for a cause or charity, for any other particular reason. Some social media sites are simply better slanted toward outcomes dependent on your need than others, and only you will know which do the best for your needs.
Even if you decide that you need to keep all the social media accounts you have, there are probably better ways to aggregate them, namely organize them so that they're in one place. If you're not already using a program that lets you aggregate different accounts on the same social media site, get one, as it makes life a lot easier. Many such programs can be downloaded for free and unless you need all the bells and whistles, they are generally free to run too.

, And it is a frustrating experience to find the results not matching the efforts. This is one important factor that usually leads to psychological burnout. An intelligent SEO and SEM management would lead to much better results.


The title or the first line of the post should be enticing enough for the people to read the entire post and click the link to reach the concerned web page. You need to spend as much time on the designing the title as on the contents of the post. The title should encourage your friends to like it, and more importantly share it.
Liberally use “#” tags to categorize your post to as many segments as possible. This will help your post to appear on search engine in more categories, more often, and any result that appears more number of times on search engine from diverse geographic and demographic regions, starts getting higher search engine ranking, thus providing more visibility. “#” tag is a very relevant factor on Google+ & Tweeter.
Try to include relevant quotes from people who are frequently searched on search engine. For example if you include a quote from Bill Gates, you can have a # tag as #Bill Gates. This adds a bit extra to the visibility factor.
Comment on trending topics. Though the topic may not be connected with your product, an intelligent comment will encourage people to view your page, where they can view your post, some may even be inclined to retweet or share the comment, thus bringing in more people to your page, and increase n followers.
While posting on Linkedin. It is important to post only on relevant groups. Linkedin allows you to join 50 groups. Join the most relevant groups, and post on them. Ask questions, Ask for suggestions, encourage members to comment, respond to each and every comment. More number of comments (that includes yours also) will help the post to remain live longer on the group. Please post only once. Don’t spam.

, To set the all-necessary boundaries in place and to skew the input toward mostly the stuff that inspires you, a plan can be helpful. It doesn't need to be complicated (in fact, the simpler, the better) but it does need to have a sense of direction.


Start by focusing on the things that you've identified as mattering most to you. What will you action out of this list from now on? What will you cease to action?
If you haven't already set in place a time allotment schedule, do so now. For example, if you've decided that Twitter is your top resource and Facebook a pale second, then schedule most of the time you're allotting for social media input to Twitter, with a much reduced amount of time given to Facebook. Try to choose time percentages that reflect what you get out of each social media stream.
Be tough on just how much time you will allot daily to social media in general. Select an amount of time that is reasonable and in proportion to all of your other day's activities. The amount will vary dependent on whether you're using social media for fun or work, or both, but be honest about the real amount of time needed. Generally, if you need the internet for work purposes (for example, you're a paid blogger, a website owner, etc.), then you will probably need more time online than someone who uses the internet for fun and socializing only. But even for those working with the internet, eight hours a day online should be sufficient time and only some of that time needs to be devoted to social media. Allocate finite time slots, perhaps once a day or several times throughout the day, and plan to stick to these. And importantly––make it a point to carve out family and friends time, especially on weekends, as well as time to tend to chores, your personal needs (exercise, relaxing, hygiene, etc.) and general life needs.
Draw up or digitally produce a ""chart of interaction."" This can help you to track interactions and enable you to overcome a sense of not interacting enough with key people. This means you'll need to identify key people with whom to interact regularly first. Then, create a sliding scale of interaction that will fit in these key followers/fans, etc. according to importance or value. Realize that even one interaction every few days can be sufficient––you do not have to enter into ""he said/she said"" conversations on a regular basis! If you've fallen into this habit, put a boundary around it now. It's polite enough to acknowledge regularly rather than engage deeply every single time.
Be clear on when it's okay not to interact. Again, this is about boundary setting––a lot of comments, posts or updates don't need to be replied to and many general interactions don't require a high level of responsiveness either. Make up your mind to respond to quality and where clarification is essential (such as on a blog commentary) rather than trying to respond to everything. In particular, unless you truly need to quell a reputation-damaging fire, avoid responding to negative comments or things that are deliberately provocative. Life's too short.

, If you've become used to updating on-the-go, it can be a good idea to stop this piecemeal habit and to corral your updates to specific places, on specific devices. Some ideas to help you do this include:


Smartphone/cell phone updates: Your mobile may be your biggest problem since you can carry it anywhere you go and can use it for quick and easy access to your social media accounts. Turn off your notification ringtone. If you hear a ringtone every time you receive a tweet or Facebook notification, hearing that sound may make it difficult to ignore. Also, try putting your mobile device away. If you keep the phone in your pocket or attached to your belt, you're going to be more likely to take a peek at it.
Eat your meals at the table with your family or real life friends, or a good book, instead of with your social media friends. It can be all too easy to plop down in front of the computer for a meal, to check updates and status changes. Yet, doing this perpetuates your social media obsession and isn't conducive to good boundaries (let alone an enjoyable meal). You might even consider making a rule that no food can be near the computer––there goes the fuel needed to stay glued to social media all night long!
Get away from the desk or portable device more often. Clean your office space or home, get some exercise, think while walking about, do yoga or dance, take the dog for a walk, spend more time with your kids, visit a lonely neighbor or get involved in something good. The social media can wait.
Do you have a distinct work or computer space in your home or office environment? If you're forever bouncing from one spot to another, changing digital devices as you shift, you're telling your brain that it's okay to go online wherever you are, whenever. This prevents you from making boundaries and sticking to them, so it's recommended that you select a spot in your home/office/wherever you do social media and make that the only place you do social media interacting.
Many people think it's okay to do social media inputting in front of the TV. Maybe it is in short spurts but the trouble sets in when this becomes a ritual or a habit for you and you associate TV with updating online. If you're barely concentrating on TV or on anyone around you while you're busy with social media, you need to ask yourself what the real benefit of this type of behavior is to you––the lack of attentiveness can soon create a scatter-brained feeling to everything you do. Not only can human beings not multi-task successfully but at the end of each session like this, you can tend to feel exhausted all while wondering what it is you've actually done. And if you have children, think about what signals you're sending out with respect to human interaction.

, Whether you're doing these things on social media for friendly, volunteer or work purposes, it's important to not be overwhelmed by the whole ""you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours"" phenomenon that social networking often encourages. This is a fine approach but only to a small extent––even if the technology being used never lets up and doesn't need sleep or refreshing, you need both. By being more selective and a little more assertive about saying ""no"", you can ease yourself out of commitments that don't fit within your boundaries and values.


If you ever feel coerced into sharing or helping someone with spreading the word via social media, that's a good indicator that you're too pressured. Try to meet existing outstanding commitments but start easing off accepting any new ones. Tell people that you cannot continue to do the things they've asked of you in future (for example, because of lack of time, a change in your direction, a reshuffle of commitments, etc.). Be polite but stay firm––this is about liberating yourself from being bound to commitments online that don't match up with what truly matters to you. Moreover, if you're asked to share commercial/product news or information for free, decline to do so––you have a value if you're being asked, so ask for payment and make the effort worth your time, or don't do it at all.
Accept that no human can be all places all of the time. It's a simple fact that can be easily lost in the rapidity and enthusiasm of social media engagement. You are entitled to time off, be it your weekend, your evenings or a day here and there. You are entitled to update once or twice a day only, or only when there's something interesting to say. You are entitled to interact with social media with a regularity that fits into your current lifestyle rather than one dictated by trying to keep up with other people's over-committed examples.
Don't be afraid to tell people that you're busy. It's their problem if they can't accept that you're a working mom, a programmer working 6am to 11pm, a freelancer with tight deadlines, etc. You've explained your limitations and it's their choice to be overly imaginative about your time availability. Whatever they think doesn't make their ideas about when you should be available any more valid. Use your profile, your updates and any other relevant places to tell people why you're busy and when you are available to interact.

, It can help to develop your sense of humor, particularly when responding to people who might otherwise get their hackles up about your levels of commitment to networking with them. A few pithy, fun lines that acknowledge the other person but make light of the situation can be a good way of defusing people who ask too much from you in social media contexts. For yourself, humor can help to keep your approach toward social media lighthearted and purposeful.

, This question is useful both in terms of time allocation and also in terms of delivering quality to those following your social media accounts. Make every update, post, comment and share count. Ask yourself if the content or opinion is interesting, if the tone is appropriate and if the context is right before posting. And ask yourself: ""Would I want to read/know this?"" Be honest!


Beware cross-posting between social media accounts. Sometimes this can work but if lots of your friends or fans are following each of your social media accounts, they'll get an overdose of your information and start to see you as being rather unoriginal. Try to be more variety-focused than this and use the ""quality not quantity"" equation to keep it manageable.
If you've gotten into the bad habit of being the ""mad poster"", who just has to be the first to update everyone on relevant news, stories or information, try chilling for a bit. First, the news will still reach everyone's ears whether or not you're sharing it (and many a time it's best not to be the sharer of early news that can often contain misinformation); second, you may have a false sense of utility by doing this when in actual fact you may have a reputation for ""always being glued to the screen/obsessive"". Is that really how you want your friends perceiving you?

, For those who use social media to promote their business, work or freelancing activities, don't try to do it all alone. You can hire people to help specifically with running social media. Or, think laterally about getting people who can help with other aspects of your life that can free you up to concentrate on your necessary social media input, such as hiring a babysitter or nanny for your kids, or a gardener to fix that never-ending garden mess or someone to answer the desk calls, freeing up your time to get the networking done. Look for affordable ways that will add value to your experience and help you enjoy social media interaction rather than viewing it as a chore.


Consider family members and friends as people who might be able to help you out in some way. Pocket money, a gift or simply acknowledging they're doing you a good turn can be a great way to repay their kindness in helping you out. Such help can be especially useful if you're running a special social media campaign for a fledgling business or a cause and you feel swamped.
Maybe consider teaming up with a friend who also has social media work/business/freelancing requirements but finds these obligations somewhat overwhelming. You could create a roster together that lets each of you have time on and time off, caring for each other's updates and information sharing as needed. This could make a great vacation arrangement too.

, You can't smell roses online, well not yet anyway, and even if you could, it wouldn't be authentic. Real life should always come first because this is from where you draw your inspiration, energy and vibrancy. And it's important to get balance so that your IRL (in real life) experiences continue to be your principal form of interacting with others. Can you remember the last time you met up with your IRL friends? If you can't, then it's time to restore this aspect of your life pronto!


Engage in real life conversations with your BFF or a group of friends again. Social media is a poor substitute for face-to-face interactions. Make arrangements to catch up today!
Take your family out to dinner or the movies without any electronic devices accompanying you. Keep one very simple family phone that has no internet access for just such occasions, in case you need to make emergency calls but nothing else.
Get your business team out of the office and away from social media screens. Go to the park together, get to a cafe for lunch together or do a fun activity as a team. This can reinforce team spirit and give everyone a refreshing break from screens, screens and more screens!
Plant some real roses (or other favorite flowers) in your garden or on the balcony. Tend to them, water them, love them and watch them grow. Sit with your roses and contemplate the world for a bit. You may be very surprised at how much inspiration for your social media interactions springs from such times away from online networking. Keep a paper notebook and pen with you for inspirational moments that you can share online later. Or, just let it all sink in, to be recalled later when needed.

It is not as flashy or intuitive as other recovery programs, but it is one of the most powerful free data recovery solutions, and works on virtually all operating systems.


PhotoRec can be downloaded from the CGSecurity website. Ensure that you are downloading the correct version for your operating system.;
, PhotRec is a lightweight program, and does not need to be installed. Instead, open the ZIP file after it is downloaded and copy the folder to an easy-to-access location on your hard drive, such as the root of C: drive or your desktop.

, Double-click on the ""photorec_os"" file in the TestDisk folder. The os part of the name will be replaced with whatever version you downloaded. For example, if you are using Windows, the file will be called ""photorec_win"".

, Ensure that the SD card has been inserted into your computer's card reader, or that it is inserted in the camera and the camera is connected to the computer via USB. When PhotoRec starts, you will be given the option to choose which disk you want to recover data on. Use the arrow keys to select your SD card.


If you have multiple partitions on the disk, you will be asked to select which partition you want. Most memory cards aren't partitioned, so you won't need to choose.

, You are given a few options before the recovery process starts. Most users can leave these at their defaults, but if you want to recover files even if they are corrupted, you can enable that on this screen.


Enabling ""brute force"" will recover fragmented files, and is very CPU intensive.

, By default, all of the file types are highlighted. If you know exactly what files you are looking for, you can narrow it down to speed up the search. Each extension in the list has a brief definition next to it to help you determine what kind of file it is.


If you are recovering for a camera, you will want to focus on RAW and CR2 files, as well as JPG

, PhotoRec will need to know what file system type the memory card has. Most memory cards are formatted in one of the systems in the ""Other"" category.


If you aren't able to get any results, try running the scan again with the other file system option.

, PhotoRec will give you two options for space checking: Free or Whole. If your memory card is corrupt, you will get better results with the Whole option. The Free option will only look for files that have been specifically deleted.

, The last thing you need to do before you start scanning for files is set a location for recovered files to be saved. You will need to select a location on your computer and not on the memory card you are trying to recover from. Use your arrow keys to change directories.

, You can see the scan results update as the scan is performed. PhotoRec will make at least two passes on the card to try to find as many files as possible. This will take several minutes.

, After the scan is complete, the recovered files will be available in the directory you set before the scan started. The original filenames will almost always be lost, so you will need to manually change them back to whatever you want.If the files you need are still corrupt, there is likely no way for them to be fully recovered.

Keep an open mind.,
Think of the symbols as shapes and not as their meanings.,
Combine two or more symbols and numbers to make single letters, such as |= for F or |3 for B.,
Pay attention to context.,
Familiarize yourself with common phonetic replacements.,
Brace yourself for flagrant misspellings.,
Learn new grammatical structures.,
Embrace acronyms.,

Practice reading 1337 and study the chart below.",How to Read and Write in 1337," Like all languages, 1337 isn't static. Reading 1337 can be difficult and the language may not always appear to make sense, especially since new words, random capitalizations and alternative spellings proliferate. You can learn basic guidelines for 1337, but there are no rules, and individuals alter the language to suit their own needs. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the same can be said for any language. All languages are living and changing; 1337 is simply very alive and changing quickly.

, For example, a 5 looks a bit like an S, as does a $, so either of these symbols (among others) could be substituted for an S. When writing in 1337, you can follow guidelines such as those below, you can use the same substitutions of symbols for letters that you see other people using, or you can make up your own substitutions.

, Again, you will find some frequently-used combination substitutions, but don't be afraid to be creative when you're writing, and don't be discouraged if you come across something unfamiliar when you're reading.

, If you can't figure out the meaning of a symbol, try to guess its meaning based on the letters (symbols) around it. This is a bit like playing hangman or Wheel of Fortune: you try to figure out the missing letter or letters by looking at the surrounding letters. The same can be said of whole words. If a word doesn't make sense, you might not be translating it right, or it might be unfamiliar slang. Try to guess its meaning by looking at adjacent words or the sentence which contains the word.

, In addition to symbol-for-letter replacement, 1337 can include letters which substitute for other letters, sounds or words. For instance, f = ph, cks = xx, s = z or r = are. This practice is certainly not unique to 1337--you don't have to be a 1337$p34|<3r (leetspeaker) to figure out the phrase ""i luv u.""

, Some, such as ""kewl"" (for ""cool"") are phonetic replacements, while others such as ""teh"" (for ""the), or ""ownt"" and ""pwned"" (for ""owned"") have just grown into the language as an inside joke. Other variations, such as omission of vowels, are also common. ""Creative"" spelling is just part of 1337.

, 1337 users often deviate from standard English grammatical structures, and they have invented some grammatical devices of their own. For example, the suffix ""0rz"" can be added to a word to make it plural or to add emphasis, as in ""r0xx0rz"" for ""rocks,"" where ""r0xx"" would substitute for ""rocks"". Another common suffix is ""3d,"" used to indicate the past tense such that ""rocked"" becomes ""r0xx0r3d,"" as is ""7h47 r0xx0r3d"" (""that rocked""). It has also become something of a convention to change verbs to nouns by preceding the verb with ""the"" or, especially, ""teh.""

, Though technically just chat-speak, the use of acronyms and abbreviations is common in 1337. There are a tremendous number of acronyms used in electronic communication, among them BTW (""by the way""), TTYL (""talk to you later""), and the ubiquitous LOL (generally meaning ""laugh out loud""). Even the meaning of unfamiliar acronyms will probably become obvious if the letters are examined in context, for example ROFLBBQCOPTER (""ROFLBBQCOPTER"") or ROFLB52BOMBER (""ROFLB52BOMBER""), and you can always make your own.

, Though most of the ""new"" words in 1337 are simply misspellings of English words (""taht"", for example, or ""pwn""), some are actually new coinages, such as ""nooblet""--this could be written, for example, as ""n008137""--which denotes a ""noobie,"" or the 'newguy' |\|3\/\/|3 (newb) someone new to 1337 or something else. The best way to learn the vocabulary is to read a lot of 1337.

, Sometimes, you'll see people with 1337 ""skillz,"" sometimes you'll see ""5k1||5,"" and sometimes ""$c1llz0r3d."" Sometimes all three will be the same person writing in the same passage. There is a lot of inconsistency in 1337--get used to it.

, Random capitalization is arguably an integral part of 1337. Some writers employ a consistent method, such as capitalizing all letters except vowels or only ending letters, but many simply capitalize letters (where they are not replaced by symbols), whenever they want..

, The only way to really learn 1337 is to absorb it by reading and writing a lot of it. If you read through 1337 $|o3/-\|< |=/-\57 3|\|0U9|-| u

, Though there may be additional information needed, you'll typically be required to add the following information for all email providers:

Your name
Your preferred email address
Your preferred password
Your date of birth

, In some cases, you'll be required to verify your identity over the phone (as in the case of Yahoo), while other email providers simply ask you to prove you're human by checking a box. Once you've completed the setup process, you're ready to send your email., If you just finished setting up your account, you should be looking at your inbox right now. Otherwise, you'll have to re-enter your email provider's address in your browser.

Yahoo - Click Compose in the upper-left corner of the page (desktop) or tap the pencil icon (mobile).

, You'll typically do this in the ""To"" field, which is usually the text field at the top of the new email window.

Email addresses are in the following format: name@emailprovider.com (for example, ""ilovewikihow@gmail.com"").
There is usually an option for ""Cc"" and ""Bcc"" in the ""To"" field. Selecting ""Cc"" will allow you to add another person's email address, and ""Bcc"" lets you add an email address that is hidden from other recipients.

, While optional, typing a subject into the ""Subject"" field will give some context to the email.

For example, an email about puppies might have the subject ""Puppies"" to preface the body of the email.
The subject line is typically below the ""To"" field.

, You'll do this in the large, white space below the Subject field., Many email providers simply have a toolbar located between the subject line and the body of the email that allows you to perform simple formatting functions, from choosing a font style, color, and size to creating a bulleted list.

If you want to make the text in your email bold, for example, you'd highlight the text you wish to bold and then select the black B icon in the toolbar.

, Most email interfaces have a paperclip icon that, when clicked, allows you to select files to upload to your email. It is usually located at the bottom of the body of the email or somewhere along the toolbar between the subject line and the body of the email.

Email providers have a size limit for files (for example, Gmail allows up to 25 megabytes of files to be uploaded per email).

, The ""Send"" button is almost always located on the bottom of the message template on either the left or right side. Doing so will send your email to the person (or people) whose email address(es) you placed in the ""To"" field.

Make sure your email sends before navigating your browser to another page. Most email providers will take close the email template and return you to the inbox once the email sends.

Test.,
Not working?",How to Repair an Electric Cord," A cord suspected of being defective or damaged should not be handled while energized.;
,,  If an extension cord, unplug the any cord connected to it.  With the end in in your hand, notice if it feels warm.  A warm end indicates a potential problem (more on this later). The end should have the ""blades"" or ""prongs"" checked for evidence of disfigurement, melted, darkened or burned insulating materials around blades.  Extension cords should have the female end checked for these same conditions.

, Visually inspect the entire length of the cord for damage - such as cuts, tears holes or burn marks in the jacket or insulation. Slip the cord through your hand to feel for inconsistencies that may not be easy to see - especially on the blind side of the cable. Mark the area(s) of suspected damage.

, Determine which could be a potential source of danger to those using the cord, etc. from those that appear to be only superficial.

, Many appliances and older ""2 wire"" (ungrounded) extension cords employ polarized cords and caps. Polarized cord caps consists of different width blades that only allows the plug to be inserted one way into an outlet. The cord caps are connected to a (flat) two wire cord. These cords have a feature to identify one wire from the other. One wire will either have a ridge running the entire length of the cord, have printed information about the cord on it at evenly spaced intervals, have different colored conductors (gold / silver), or some other means. Check the old cord end to see if it had a polarized type cap. If it does, it will be important to replicate which wire was connected to the wide blade and which was connected to the narrow blade.

, Once the identifier has been determined to be present, choose a location between the appliance and the damaged section (as close to the damaged section as possible) and cut the remaining cord and end off.

,  Only use a replacement cord cap with the same number of blades as the original. Round cords are usually three wire grounding types and have different color insulated wires under the outer jacket.  If presented with a (1) white or gray wire, (2) a green or green / yellow wire and (3) a colored wire (often red or black), the green / yellow wire will be connected to the long, ground blade; white / gray to the wide blade and the remaining colored wire to the narrow blade (or openings if replacing the opposite end of an extension cord). If a flat, two wire cable; make sure the wire with the identifier is terminated to the blade of the same relative width as the original to maintain polarity is intended by the manufacturer.

,  Make sure all the small strands of the wire are secured under their respective terminals.  These strands should be twisted together and then wrapped clockwise around any terminal screw(s). Strands that are permitted to bridge different terminals will cause a short circuit and can result in an arc flash, blown fuse or circuit breaker or worse.  If all strands are not fully under their respective terminals, it effectively reduces the size of the wire to carry the load - and will cause heat build up or a reduced voltage at the other end.  Tighten all connections securely and assemble housing to complete. Be sure to install any insulating barriers supplied with the replacement cord cap.

, Doing so can crush the cable jacket / wire insulation and create a new hazard to anyone that comes in contact with it.

,  If at all possible, shut off power to the outlet to be used and plug in the repaired cord and cord cap.  Turn power back on and test the device or cord without coming into contact with the area of the repair.

,  It is possible that there is more than one source for the problem.  Warm cord caps can indicate excessive build up of oxidation, dirt, or other condition that is interfering with a good connection.  The problem may lay inside the outlet (or the openings of an extension cord) as heat felt on one end of the cord will be present on the mating surfaces of the connection. Over time, the heating and cooling of the metal contact parts in the outlet become fatigued, resulting in less ""squeeze"" strength.  These surfaces may no longer grip the blades of the cord cap sufficiently and may require replacing the outlet (or in the case of an extension cord - female end cord cap).

Find a replacement battery.,



 

The battery pack contains two to four AA NiCd cells connected in series.,
Remove the insulation from the tab (found at one end) and fold the tabs at both ends back over themselves.,
To open the ER203, move the depth adjustment to the shortest cut position, remove the comb guide and the clipper head.,
Once the screws are out, you can pop off the back of the clipper.,
Remove the old battery.,
Insert the new battery with the end of the battery that has a groove/crimp toward the clipper end of the shaver.,
Reassemble.,
Plug in.",How to Repair the Battery in a Panasonic ER203 Clipper," It turns out that almost any nickel cadmium (NiCd, NiCad) battery with solder tabs will work just fine. To get such a battery, you can order one from any electronics supplier, McMaster-Carr, or many battery suppliers. The simpler way to get one (actually, two or three in most cases) is to buy a replacement battery pack for a cordless phone -- these are available locally at most any place that sells cordless phones.
, Your task is to take the pack apart! Remove a strip of plastic and pop the two cells (connected together) out of the carrier. Pry the two cells apart a bit to expose the connection at one end between the two cells. Cut the strip with some scissors (you don't really need wire cutters, but that is the proper tool)., These will be the connections to the ER203 later., There are two screws under the clipper and one at the base near the cord socket. A very small Phillips screwdriver is needed for these screws., Try to keep the depth adjustment knob in the clipper or at least note its position., It is held only by the posts at each end., I found that putting the bent tab in with the bend first and aligned vertically worked best. The other end of the battery goes in the same way but the bend in the tab may be 90- or 180-degrees off from the ""top"" of the battery -- just make sure the tab contacts the clip that held the post on the old battery. I did have to use a bit of force to get the battery fully inserted (not more than finger pressure!) as the original battery is just slightly shorter than a standard AA with solder tabs. Soldering is not necessary!, The only tricky part about reassembly is the depth knob. Make sure it works for the full adjustment range before tightening the screws., Once charged, you should be ready to trim for another few years."

Know what phishing is.,
Know what phishing scammers are after.",How to Spot an Email Hoax or Phishing Scam1," Email hoaxes are often termed ""phishing"". This term refers to the instances where the scammer sends out a mass email to every address he or she has managed to glean by whatever method. The hope is that at least a few people will be gullible enough within that mass emailing to respond––and send cash or personal details.;
, In a nutshell, they want cash or identifying information that can give them access to sources of cash. They hope that they can trick people into revealing sensitive personal information such as passwords to accounts, banking information, Social Security numbers, mother’s maiden name, date of birth, among others. Phishing scams are targeted to gather personal information in order to hijack your assets or steal your identity to open credit accounts in your name.


Social media is another form of scamming. Fake Facebook, Twitter, etc. accounts can be used to present a front that seems genuine, only to disappear when the fraud has been committed, no traces left.

Develop a set of red flags that tell you to be wary.,
Check the facts - every time.,
Set your mind at ease when it comes to a personal friend or family member seemingly in trouble.,
If you find the email is a hoax and comes from someone you know personally, immediately reply to the original sender to let him or her know.",How to Spot an Email Hoax or Phishing Scam2," Some basics that should set off your suspicions include:


Bad spelling and/or poor grammar in an email claiming to represent a company, royalty, a prize agency, whatever.
Unsolicited commercial or personal request email. Do you even know of this company or person? If the name seems unfamiliar and you don't recall ever signing up to the company or sharing details with this individual, be suspicious upon receipt of such an email.
Asking for money. Always start from the grounds that a request for money is to be treated with suspicion until proven otherwise. Perhaps your daughter is vacationing in the land of Grail and it's not unknown for her to ask for more funds to fly home. But if you suddenly get an email from her claiming she has lost everything and needs thousands of dollars to bribe local officials, be wary; mass emails claiming such distress are not uncommon, using hacked email accounts.
The email is full of promises to reward you. Promises of this type are rather personal; you should be very wary of such emails.
The email is from somewhere you don't live, like Nigeria or Singapore and you either know nobody there or it's not the email of anyone you do know there. Put up your red flag.

, The reason emails warning of silly urban legends spread so quickly is because people receive them from their trusted friends, and never imagine these smart, clever people could be fooled. Before forwarding any email, take a second to search one of the databases listed below.


Bear in mind that a friend's or colleague's email can be hacked and that the sender isn't your friend or colleague but the hacker who wants something for nothing.
In turn, don't forward such emails yourself. Scams, threats, chain letter emails, etc., are illegal in many countries and not only is it bad netiquette to forward such rubbish, it could also put you on the wrong side of the law.

, If someone tells you that they're a friend in trouble, offer to pay their costs direct. For example, if the ""friend"" tells you he has been mugged and has had his wallet stolen and needs funds to pay for the hotel, offer to ring the hotel direct and sort it out on their behalf. If the reply is ""no, no, please make a wire transfer"", be very suspicious that this isn't your friend but a fraudster on the other end.


Be wary of any email request asking for wire transfers of money! If you are going to wire money anywhere in the world, deal with people face-to-face in reputable companies, such as when sending money from an auction house to another one, or sending money to a family friend who has already confirmed the details with you in person or over the phone. If you want to send money to a charity in this way, talk to someone in the charity's head office (either in person or using a Yellow Pages phone link) and sort it out officially; you may even like to involve a financial or legal representative to ensure it is legitimate.

, Select 'Reply all' if appropriate, or suggest that the sender send an email to this effect. Remember to include a link to the site debunking the email!

"
"
If you receive an email requesting money or personal information in return for great riches, do not respond!,
If you receive an e-mail that appears to be from a company or website you do business with that asks you to input any personal information, such as your username, password or bank account details, do not respond to it or click on any links.,
Remember that speed is your enemy.",How to Spot an Email Hoax or Phishing Scam3," Responding to emails like this - or any type of spam - merely confirms your email account as an active one and can result in you getting a whole lot more spam. Forwarding an email like this to an anti-phishing website, like the ones listed below, can help stop or slow its progress.

, If you are concerned that there may be an actual problem with your account, navigate to the website yourself and log in.


Do not copy and paste text or links from the email to your web browser. What you might be able to do if the link is live and you're in an online email program, is hover your mouse over the link, without clicking and check the browser for confirmation of where that link will take you; if it's not legitimate, you'll soon see an odd address. This is simply more confirmation of your suspicions.
Banks do not send emails asking for you to input personal information from an email link. They're wise to the scams, so don't fall for any such emails. Visit or call the bank if you're worried and get reassurance from a teller or customer service officer (and use the Yellow Pages telephone number, not any number provided in an email).

, It is better to be slow in responding than to be fast in replying and lose it all. When your suspicions are raised, take time away from the email to talk to a trusted person, check online websites for information about scams or even call the police for information.

Learn to identify spam.",How to Spot an Email Hoax or Phishing Scam4," Help your family to also spot the signs of hoax emails. And let friends know if you suspect they have been hacked or have unwittingly forwarded on spam or hoax emails; that way, you all learn together.

, Both you and family members can shield yourself a lot more by asking the following questions of every email you receive:


Has this person ever sent me spam before? Is there a sudden barrage of nonsensical spam emails from this person (an indicator that their email is hacked)?
If the email tells you to open an attachment, you should not do this. This is especially so if the attachment name ends in .pif or .scr.
If the email is from a 'free' email account (hotmail.com, yahoo.com, etc.), and you don't know the sender, treat it with great suspicion.
If there is a link in the email, hover your cursor over it (but do not click it!). This often reveals that the real location the link will take you is a (phishing) website you have never even heard of.
Is the email mentioning recent natural disaster or similar headline events? Scammers watch headlines carefully to monitor for anything causes people distress; it is a way of setting up fake charities to ask for funds that only ever help the criminals involved. This includes links to fake websites and PayPal accounts (again, don't ever click).
If you do click the link to go to, say, an online banking website, check to see if the address says 'https' or 'http'. Almost all banking websites will use 'https'. If you are still not sure, go to the actual website by opening a new tab and typing its name into your search engine. Compare the 2 addresses.
If you get an email from a friend who lives close by, or who you can contact by phone, ask them if they sent you that email. Even the best phishers haven't found a way to direct calls to them and perfectly imitate your friend's voice!
Think back and ask yourself: Did I physically enter my name into this sweepstakes? Even if you think you ""might"" have, why aren't they phoning you? Call the company direct, using the Yellow Pages phone directory, not the email contact details.
Check both the 'To' and the 'From' lines. If they both have the same address/person/name in them, it is a phishing email/scam.
Is there a threat of immediate detrimental action if I don't respond with personal information? Threats by email are illegitimate, do not deserve your attention but may need to be drawn to the attention of police or anti-scam officials. Remember, you have done nothing wrong––the scammer is the one doing that.

Check both sides for damage.,
Wash the CD with a damp, lint-free cloth.,
Choose your toothpaste.,
Squirt the toothpaste onto a lint-free cloth.,
Gently wipe the scratched area.,
Wash off the toothpaste.,
Dry the CD.,
Try stronger abrasives.",How to Repair a CD With Toothpaste," A CD stores information just beneath the label. A scratch that tears through the label usually destroys the CD permanently. Fortunately, scratches are more common on the reflected side, and that's where toothpaste comes in handy. The laser that reads the CD needs to bounce evenly off the smooth, reflective surface.Toothpaste is just abrasive enough to wear down scratched areas to a smoother surface.


Small scratches and scuff marks are much easier to repair than deep gouges. Some CD repair services can repair the disc with a special buffing machine, but these are hard to use without causing damage.;
, Even if you can't see them, tiny flecks of dust on the CD could gouge out new scratches when rubbed with the toothpaste. To prevent this, hold the disc under cool, running water and rub it with a lint-free cloth such as cotton or microfiber. Always rub directly from the center to the edge, never in small, circular motions or along the circular pathways. Only wash the reflective side of the disc.


If the CD is very dusty, gently spray it with canned air first.
If the CD is visibly greasy, use rubbing alcohol or a CD cleaning solution instead of water.

, Only an actual ""paste"" will work, not a gel.If convenient, choose a ""whitening"" or ""tartar control"" toothpaste. These tend to be more abrasive, which will help polish the CD.


You might be able to look up your toothpaste brand online to find the ""RDA,"" a measure of abrasiveness.A high RDA toothpaste usually makes a smoother surface, although that's not always true., As before, a clean rag made from cotton or microfiber is ideal. You can use a cotton swab instead.

, Rub the toothpaste over the scratched area. Always move from the center directly to the edge. Repeated movement will slowly wear down the CD, smoothing it out to the level of the scratch. Do not press hard.

, Hold the CD under running water. Wipe it with a clean cloth in the same direction of movement.

, Be careful, as dry CD is more easily scratched than a wet one. Blot away most of the water first, placing a lint-free cloth directly onto the CD and lifting. Finish by air drying or very gentle rubbing with a dry area of the cloth. As always, rub from the center to the edge in straight lines.

, Test the CD once it is completely dry. If it still doesn't function, you can try the same cleaning process with a polish meant for silver, plastic, or furniture. Never use a polish that smells like kerosene or contains petroleum derivatives, as these can break down the CD."

Give your computer a bit of rest.,
Determine if your computer becomes too hot.,
Diagnostics.,
Open the cabinet of your computer and check the temperature of the metal chassis.,
Inspect your Device Drivers.,
Try a System Restore.,
Inspect your Hard Disk.Your hard disk is a storehouse of information, so when it gets used for a long duration it might get cluttered and patchy; this slows down the performance of your computer.,
Install and run a good antivirus and anti-malware program.  ,
Reinstall your operating system.",How to Repair a Computer1," If you leave your computer on all the time, you can often fix a problem by turning off the computer, then unplugging it (or remove the battery, if it is a laptop), then holding down the power button for 30 seconds while computer remains unplugged (this will often cause a light, or lights, to flash), then reinserting the battery, plugging the computer back in and powering it on. By cutting off the power to the motherboard, it allows the hardware to reset and the memory to clear.;
, You will need to take a look inside for this. Remember that any time you need to open up your computer cabinet, shut down your computer and unplug it. If you have long hair, tie it back. Take off any jewelry that might get in the way. Also avoid wearing any clothing that produces a lot of static, as a spark can damage hardware and cause intermittent, hard-to-troubleshoot problems.

, Many computers now come with built-in diagnostics which can tell you if you have certain issues. Two brands of computer that normally have diagnostic options are HP/Compaq and Dell. To access these diagnostic options:

Power down the computer, wait a few seconds then turn it back on.
HP - Immediately start pressing F2 on startup to access the diagnostic menu. Select Start Up Test, Quick, One Pass (if option is present) to begin the testing process.
Dell - Immediately start pressing F12 on startup to access the diagnostic menu. Use the arrow keys to select Diagnostics from the menu.
Write down any error codes and consult the internet, the computer manufacturer or a local technician for assistance.

, If it’s hot, then there may be a heat related issue. For laptops, you generally do not want to try to open the case, but you can still vacuum the fan ports. Some computers just run hot, particularly laptops, but heat is never good for electronics. Gently examine the front and rear fans and blow out any dust. You can apply a clean cloth to dust out hidden particles. Remember: Your computer must be shut down while you're cleaning inside it.


If you have more than one hard drive in your computer, avoid installing them right next to each other in the chassis; this makes them more prone to heat failure. To install an extra hard drive in a wide slot, such as the slot that holds your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive, you can buy mounting brackets at a store that sells computer parts.
Even if your computer isn't having problems, it's a good idea to clean the fans regularly.
Before you close up the case, check all the cables and make sure everything is still plugged in. If you have to reset a video card or a stick of memory, avoid applying heavy pressure to the motherboard as this can damage it.

, Many times when doing a Windows Update, your system may download and install an incorrect driver, which may result in the computer freezing. You can check the status of drivers from Device Manager. Any devices with a yellow exclamation next to them are in an error state. Unplug any USB devices, if connected, and see if the error goes away. If so, that device is a problem. Power-on your computer and see if it works. If it does, good; otherwise you can restore your computer to an earlier configuration. System Restore will roll your system back to an earlier set of drivers.

, It can be accessed by pressing and holding the Windows Logo key and pressing R, and then typing ""rstrui"" in the Run dialog box. Using a restore point to restore your computer can remove software (like an app, driver, or update) that might be causing the problem.


Once started, System Restore can NOT be interrupted, so be patient.
Changes made to your PC by System Restore cannot be undone if you are running it in Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment.

, Hence, use your Windows utility CHKDSK to scan and remove bad sectors on regular basis. It is the best preventive way of maintaining computer health.

,, If all else fails, reinstalling your operating system might help.

Back up your files before doing this step.

No Power.,
No Boot or Blue Screen.",How to Repair a Computer2," If your computer does not power on at all, the most likely culprits are either Power Supply (desktop only) or motherboard. Make sure the connectors are plugged in properly, and the switch on the back of the power supply is turned ON., If your computer has power (you see lights, hear fans spinning), but nothing on the screen, or if the computer starts to boot up and then crashes with a 'blue screen', there are several possible issues. NOTE: Any hardware changes must be done while computer is completely powered down and unplugged / battery removed!!

Try Safe Mode - if your computer will boot into Safe Mode, it is a software related issue.
Test Screen - If you hear the computer running, but see nothing on the screen, try swapping monitors or plugging in an external monitor for laptops.
Test RAM - try carefully removing the ram and powering on. Most computers, when functioning properly, will give a long, repeating 'memory error' beep. Power off and replace the ram, one stick at a time, powering on when ram is properly seated.
Test Video Card - if your computer has a removable video card, try removing it and either replacing it or plugging your monitor into the built-in video port if available.
If none of these things work, you are likely looking at a failed hard drive, corrupted operating system or failed motherboard. It is best to seek professional services at this time.

Be sure that you have the Galvanite Instructions and be sure to read them. ,
Pre-clean the parent metal.,
Use a soft flame, heat gun or soldering iron to heat the parent metal repair area to at least 600°F/315°C.,
Hold the torch tip 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) away from the parent metal.,
Drag the rod over the area to be soldered, until it begins to flow.,
Blend the repair into the undamaged galvanized coating.,
Observe the solder deposit.,
If you stopped soldering and want to apply more solder or flow out the deposit more, let the area cool below the solid temperature and reheat.,
Smooth the repair area and remove any excess solder with a wire brush.

,
Repeat these steps to build up additional layers of protection.

,
Gather the materials below:


Common Zinc based alloys

Zinc-Cadmium – Liquid temperature - 509°F-600°F (265°C-316°C)Tin-Zinc-Lead – Liquid temperature - 350°F-550°F (177°C-288°C)Tin-Zinc-Copper – Liquid temperature - 390°F-570°F (200°C-300°C)Propane or MAP Gas torch is recommended
Stainless steel or wire brush

",How to Repair Galvanized Coatings1,", Use these items: emery cloth, a wire brush, sandblasting, etc. Cleaning galvanized steel surfaces is often done with a stainless steel wire brush. To ensure a smooth surface result, surface preparation should extend into the surrounding undamaged galvanized coating. Breaking the oxide layer by agitation is an important key to successful galvanizing repair. If the area to be repaired includes welds, all weld flux residue and weld spatter shall be removed by wire brush, chipping, grinding or power scaling.

, Do not heat the surface over 750°F/400°C or allow the surrounding galvanized coating to burn. If you use a direct flame, keep it moving. A direct flame held on the repair area is likely to overheat the solder. Wire brush the surface during heating. Pre-flux using flux if there is an adhesion problem. NOTE: Many applications do not require flux.

, If it is necessary to apply the flame directly to the rod to get it started, pull the torch tip back even farther from the work surface and keep it moving.

, Once the rod flows, stop applying the heat. Deposit the desired thickness of galvanizing repair rod. A stainless steel brush works well to spread the solder and ensure it is adhering. If additional layers are needed, continue to drag the rod over the area.


Bring back the heat only to keep the surface, not the rod, hot enough to push the solder around to where you want it.

, The most common oversight in repairing galvanized is failing to feather the galvanizing repair material layer into the undamaged galvanized coating. If they don’t join in sufficient thickness to form a seamless barrier (skin), corrosion will occur right where they meet.

, The solder should bond smoothly. Do not overheat, the solder rod will melt if overheated, but will not bond properly. Spread the solder deposit evenly over the repair area. A stainless steel brush works well for this step.

, The existing coating will help the bonding process, whether adding more solder or just flowing out the previous deposit.


If substantial time has elapsed since the original repair layer was applied, pre-clean the repair area again to remove any oxide coating that will impair bonding. Again, a stainless steel brush works well for this step.

Choose your web space.,
Choose your data bandwidth.,
Choose your budget.,
Choose your hosting control panel.",How to Choose the Right Hosting Package for Your Website," Web space is the maximum storage size you can use in a server. Most reputable web hosting companies specify the web space, while others show that it unlimited. However, you have to take your cautions from these companies as many of them are spammers,  it is technically impractical to give someone unlimited disk space in the server. On the other hand, you should identify what type of website are you going to create and accordingly you buy a suitable package for it. For example, a blog, will not need more than a 5 GB storage to host it. But, for active forums you will need around 20 GB Storage. By any way, you can start with a minimum storage size package and upgrade it when your website content increases.
, Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred to and from your account in one month. Every time someone downloads a 10KB file from your website, they use 10KB of bandwidth from your account. Also, every time someone visits your site, they are downloading the homepage and, consequently, using that much bandwidth. Therefore, data bandwidth depends on the amount of visits you have. You will not have to worry at all if you are hosting a new website, as it will  never cross the maximum data bandwidth. However, if you are migrating an active website, you will need to check your previous usage and plan accordingly., Price is an important criteria for choosing the most suitable web hosting company for you. But you should not at all look for the cheapest ones because many of them are overselling their service and that might affect the page download speed of your website. Therefore, you should look for the reputable web hosting companies who offers convenient customer support., A control panel is where you can add email addresses, upload website, install software ,etc. There are few panels out there, however you should consider cPanel. It is the market standard and it contains tons of essential functionalists. Moreover, if you need to change your hosting company, you can easily migrate your website because most of the web hosting companies are using the same control panel."
"



 

Know the types of hosting services offered.,





Check the technical support, bandwidth tolerance and security.,





Know what other clients have to say about the service.",How to Choose Expert Web Hosting Services," Hosting may be offered through dedicated, shared, and cloud level.

Shared hosting is fairly common because it’s more affordable than the other types of hosting. However, it could slow down your website’s performance if there are too many hosting clients that share your server and the hosting service is ill equipped with substandard hardware.
Dedicated may be pricey but you get to occupy your own server, you get full control, and guarantee good performance for your website. Meanwhile, cloud hosting offers a more flexible environment because it enables smooth upgrades when your website sees increased traffic. Also, you get dedicated bandwidth, memory, and CPU so even if you do share a server with others, you don’t share resources.;
, Every business, every organisation will grow, which means the influx of traffic your website gets today could very well increase in the future. So you’ll need your Web host to offer higher bandwidth to ensure that your site doesn't stall when you get too many users on. You should also consider the security system and the level of support your Web host can deliver. Protect your website through monitoring of suspicious activities and guarantee resolution with every problem by gaining 24/7 technical support., Get proper references. You’ll want to talk to other website owners about their experiences with Web hosts. Ask how hosting issues were resolved and how fast. While no website will have all good experiences with hosting, there are some hosting companies that have fewer issues with some websites."

Examine their portfolio.,
Investigate their pricing


Another indicator that the company may charge a bit more than you're wanting is when they ask you to contact them for prices.,
Decide what functionality do you really need?,
Understand why your website should be ""living"".,
Evaluate their Customer Service


Lastly, you should go with a company that has great customer service.,
When you combine all of the portions of this article and put them together, you should have a comprehensive take on what to look for in a website company.

",How to Choose a Church Website Builder,"


Their portfolio is a good indication of what kind of work they do. Portfolios should show a variety of workmanship and features. Watch out for those portfolios that include lots of costly “extras”. Make sure that the standard features of a website are clearly marked somewhere on the site. Portfolios should also be changing frequently, possibly every three months or so, so look to see if there has been change in the site recently. Portfolios are the signature of any good website company. Make sure that each website has a signature look for the church that is being represented. If each site is a “cookie-cutter” site, then you will know that yours will look like everybody else’s.;
, If there are no sample prices, chances are that they are going to charge more. Like I mentioned above, there should be a standard set price for a set number of features that they offer. Only a few sites include every feature in each site for the same price. CAMNIO media is one of those companies. Many companies will have pricing tiers, which start from a base price with limited features, and travel up in price depending on what you need in your site. Remember to shop around as some places give you everything they offer for one low price. The tiered concept is that the top tier is the most expensive. Sites with tiers or itemized website building usually tend to be much more expensive.

,

Functionality is a key thing that you should look out for. Will it be able to show new visitors how to find your church? Or better yet, will they have a fair shot of really knowing what your church is all about without having to think about dysfunctional web design. Remember your church website is meant for your visitors too. Sites usually can have all of the bells and whistles to catch peoples eyes without being complicated or frustrating to use. Sites should be user-friendly and also always changing. If a site cannot be easily changed, then its attraction is greatly hindered. People only visit sites that stay current and fresh. Functionality is needed from every angle. Make sure that you are not spending money for a site that is too complicated to update. If you have to learn a new language to update your site, you will always be on a definite learning curve. If you know English, then your site should be programmed in English! Make sure that you get a site that has multiple user possibilities. Ask yourself these questions: Are different users able to update this? Meaning, can the youth pastor add his events, while the Senior Fellowship adds their events. “Is this site usable from the oldest to the youngest?”






But what about functionality for an existing church member? When your church members want to come and use the site to catch up on church events and important ministry information, the calendar and announcements modules comes in very handy. You want to provide functionality for each person that will visit your site. Look for sites that offer separate logins for members versus new attendees. There might be pertinent information that the members of your church need but you might not want the new visitors to be apart of. Make sure that the site offers functionality that serves the purpose of your church and your ministry events.







,


A website really should be a ""living"" website. Meaning that people within the church are involved with updating the website and keeping it fresh and new. Once pictures become out of date, or announcements are no longer relevant, people are not going to want to come back to your site for more info. In fact, it is more of a deterrent. The key, again, is for the site itself to be easily update-able. You don’t want to have to fight with your site each time you want to make updates. The easier it is to update, the more relevant and alive your site will become. And remember, a living website is more likely to grow in popularity than a stagnant dead one.

, You don’t want to be caught in a situation where you are in a crisis and the company is too busy or too impersonal to help you. Make sure that the company really does have your interest at heart. Talk to them on the phone for a few minutes and get a feel for the vision and mission of that company. If money is their motivator, you are just a dollar sign that has little value. If their focus is ministry, then their service will be more personal for the sake of the gospel. You will have a better relationship with a ministry driven, gospel minded company than one that is only business oriented. When you are in the process of designing and as you learn how to take care of your website, this friendly helpful service will be of great benefit to you.

Your site can be about jewelry itself, or aimed at a market that is likely to buy jewelry. For example, banners and ads for jewelry items could be appropriate on a site or blog that talks about fashion, gift ideas or romance, just to name a few.;
, Your affiliate efforts will be in vain if your site doesn't have visitors. Make sure the site has quality content that users will want to read and revisit regularly. Promote your site by participating in online forums, commenting on other blogs, and using keywords in your content that people search for.

, Most online affiliate programs are managed by an affiliate network like Commission Junction and ShareASale. One way to find programs is to sign up with affiliate programs and look for jewelry sales. Another is to go to the website of the jewelry you are interested in selling and look for an affiliate link on the site. If you can't find one, contact the company and ask how to become a jewelry affiliate. Another idea is to join Amazon Associates and sell jewelry from Amazon as an affiliate.

, You might choose the one with the most search volume or the best ratio of search volume to competition. This part is up to you because you know how competitive your site is. Write them down together.

, You are still optimizing the page for one chosen keyword just as before. You need to create a long and informative post.

, They are so closely related to your main keyword that you will have a good chance of ranking for them anyway, and avoid creating multiple thin pages one for each keyword as many people are now doing.

Decide what functions your website must provide, so that you know what you are looking for in a CMS.;
, Look for feature lists and see if anything slipped your mind. The goal here is to create two lists. The first should be a list of ""Wants"" and the second a list of ""Needs"". The Wants are bits of functionality that would be nice to have but are not necessarily musts. The needs are items that absolutely must be included for it to be deemed a worthwhile investment.

, Although some CMS are open source and do not cost anything for the program, it will cost money for installation, training, technical support and more. You may choose to hire a company that includes all of this in their monthly or yearly fee.

, Although it may be helpful to have someone adept in IT help out in the search, they should not take the lead. Assign someone who represents the average user of your database, to ensure they will choose something that everyone can use.

, You may notice that, as of February 2012, WordPress has approximately 32 percent of the CMS market. It is a popular open source CMS; however, you should not choose a CMS just because it is large and popular or small and personal.


An Internet search will likely show the following CMS, as well as many others: Drupal, WordPress, Silver-stripe, Magneto, Radiant CMS, iWeb, Concrete5CMS, Frog CMS, CMS Made Simple and Joomla!.

, If you find an open source CMS and no one in the company is able to give you information on using it, then search for companies that provide support for open source CMS.


If you want to use an open source CMS and you have a small or non-existent IT department, you may need to hire a CMS expert to help you install, train and help with technical support.

, If possible, arrange a meeting where they can show you how their CMS works. If they cannot do this, make sure to ask for sample websites in your industry, then schedule a conference call to talk about the most common CMS company mistakes and weaknesses.


Ask how easily and quickly the CMS can be installed and switched over from your current system. Then, once it is set in place, ask how often it will be updated. This is a 2-part question because updating of a system to provide new features is a good thing; however, extensive website maintenance time is a bad thing, especially for e-commerce sites.
Ask how many options there are for customization on the front end. The frontend is the website's appearance when all of the information on the CMS is loaded into the designed template. Many companies need to brand their website specifically, so make sure the CMS either works with your current template, or you have options to customize the template options that the company has.
Ask how easily changes can be made on the backend. The backend is where the data is entered, usually by company employees. There is also a balance to strike with the backend of a CMS. For example, each business needs a certain number of changes to be made without having to call for technical support or web developer assistance. However, making too many fields editable by too many people also opens up opportunities for mistakes. Ask how permissions are assigned for CMS changes.
Ask about the functionality of the intranet. Most companies need to store data that is accessible to employees, but not published for the public. Make sure your employees can sign in easily to get the information they need.
Ask how progressive the vendor is toward developing new features. CMS is constantly changing, as is Internet commerce. The vendor's CMS must be able to support changes, plugins and possibly even customized functions as your business and customers grow and change.
Ask about the marketing options for your company. Even if you are not using them now, you should be able to add SEO and social media functions. For example, your URLs should be customizable, and they should lead back to your main website. Ask about tags, keywords, breadcrumb navigation and other features that will help your site list highly on an Internet search.

"
"
Ask for a demo, or ""sandbox"" version, from each of your favorite 2 to 5 vendors.,
Pick a CMS and build timetables or milestones that need to be met.,
Implement your new CMS.",How to Choose a Content Management System3," Assign 1 or 2 people to use each demo and rate them. They should upload information, try social media integration, sales functions and see how their changes appear on the website.

, Before choosing your CMS, make sure that the people who are installing it can agree to a schedule that suits you, including a trial period. Test out the CMS for 90 days before committing to it for a longer contract.


Although making a transition to a CMS and then changing again in 90 days is not ideal, it is better than getting into a yearly agreement and finding out that it does not meet your needs.

, Organize a training program, and a short transitional period when your data is moved from the old system to the new 1. Make sure everyone with administrative privileges is clear on how to use it and has an IT support number.

Identify what your community will be about.,
Talk with other people.,
Create a forum.,
Join other online forums.,
Share your forum.,
Keep your community fresh.,
Organize offline meets.",How to Build a Community Online," Online communities are built on the shared interest of people. Think about what your community will be offering that other people should join it.


Are you fascinated with cars? You can create a community aimed to help and educate fellow car enthusiasts.
Love cooking? Make an online circle where people can share tips, secrets and recipes with each other.;
, Once you’ve figured out what your community will be about, you can start approaching other people that share the same interest as you. Building a community takes a lot of work, not to mention time, so take whatever help you can get. Other people can also pitch in ideas that you haven’t thought of yet and would make the group much better.

, Forums are websites where people can post messages, comments, or discuss various kinds of topics. This is the very backbone of an online community because this will be the virtual area where community members can meet new people, talk with those they know and discuss relevant ideas. There are two ways you can create a forum:


The first one is to create your own. If you have sufficient knowledge in web development and have the hardware resources to host your very own website (servers, computers, storage services, network service, etc.) then you can create and host your own forum.
If you don’t have the knowledge and resources to do so, then you can avail of various web hosting and development services online. Development firms like GoDaddy (www.godaddy.com) and HostGator (www.hostgator.com) can instantly create and host your online forum for you at a very reasonable price.

, Online communities won’t be a community without its members. Go out of your way and join other forums similar to yours.


A person is not limited to joining only one forum so you can tell other people you meet here about your online community and invite them to join yours.

, With all the social networking sites on the Internet, broadcasting your message on the Net is no longer that difficult to do. Copy the website address/URL of your online forum and post it on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other similar social networking media.


Providing a direct link to your online forum will make it easier for interested people to sign in and join your community.

, Always add new contents to your online forum. Create new discussions and threads that will help maintain the interest of members and keep the circle alive.


Try broadening the scope of your community to attract more members outside your circle. In example, if the community is about cooking, you can extend its scope to something relevant like vegetable gardening, poultry raising or even organic farming.

, To help people get to know more about each other, coordinate offline meetings and activities that will bring the community members together, physically. Members will tend to stick longer to an online community if they know the people they’re talking with inside the group personally."

Brainstorm your ideas.,
After brainstorming your ideas you now need to bring your 'DJ website' to life.,
You'll also need to buy some web space on the internet.,
Now it's time to construct your website.,
Update your website.",How to Build a Website for a DJ,"


Think what are the things that you want the website to have under it's belly. Think about the contents to be published out there: the latest news from the DJ, his performances, his/her awards, an image (as well as video) gallery about the DJ. There's a lot to think so just think think think and think BIG!!!
Think different. Visit some other DJ websites and gain inspirations from those websites and steal ideas from those websites too. remember ""Good artists burrow, Greater artists steal"". Don't imitate other websites, show your own creativity to the world.;
, Just go to any web domain registration sites to register a domain name. There are several domain registration sites like http://www.godaddy.com , http://www.000webhost.com , etc. Of course, these domain registration sites will ask for money to register a domain but http://www.000webhost.com also has a free domain registration system which lacks some features.

, Web space is the amount of data on the server which a website occupies. Your website will be needing a web space because of the codes and pics that you're going to put on your DJ website. Some sites that gives web spaces are http://www.justhost.com , http://www.bluehost.com , http://www.fatcow.com.


If your website just has some information and pictures (and videos ) of the DJ then you'll need very little space, say like 10MB-2GB but if it's a large website of the DJ with forums and games where users can sign up in your DJ website the space will eventually increase.

,


If you are a web developer and have a very good knowledge of technologies like HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, MySQL then just start coding. Remember, it's just a DJ website not a whole social network or a search engine you are creating. It will take about a week if you work hard.
For the ones who are a total dummy in web development, fear not, all you have to do is find a web developer and tell him/her to create the website for you. Tell him/her your ideas about the website. Be sure to meet your web developer every day to see how he's been working on you website. If you don't like his designs tell him to make it more nice. You can stay with the web developer when he's creating the website too.
If you don't want to pay any money to the web developer but still want your site on the internet then no problem. Many web hosting sites mentioned above have a free (as well as premium) web site builders. That means you don't have to code a single word. All you have to do is drag and drop the features you want in the website and edit them. Pretty simple. You can always use services like http://wordpress.com , http://drupal.com to make your website more awesome. However, getting a web developer to do the job maybe the best option.

http://djwebsitedesign.com/ This website can also be used to create a website for a DJ as this website claims that 'we specialize in designing unique and custom DJ websites'. So why not give it a try.

,


It's very important to update the information and photos in the website after the website is online so that it's more interactive. You can update easily by just editing the codes (if a web developer) or edit in the web site builder (if not a web developer). If you want the same visitors visiting the website, you'll need to update it more often.
Upgrade to modern web technologies. Ask your web developer (or the web hosting service) to make the website an HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, PHP5, featured website. Using the modern technologies will make your website more awesome, good looking and clean.
Don't forget to add a 'Contact Us' page on the website so that the visitors can have freedom to contact the DJ for some queries.
If the DJ has connection to social medias like facebook , twitter, google+, pinterest, then be sure to keep the links to these websites on that website too. It'll be just awesome.
If the DJ is a big celebrity, and has fans all around the globe it would be a very nice addition to add a forum to the website where the fans can interact with other fans.
Add all sorts of interactivity like Widgets, Latest tweets (from the DJ), comments on posts, etc.

Know that if you don't use your Roku for an extended period of time, it will go into Standby mode on its own to conserve energy.",How to Turn Off Roku,";
, If you plugged the Roku Streaming Player into your TV with an AV cord, then unplug it from the television; if you used an HDMI cord, then unplug that from the HDMI port. After this is done, unplug the A/C power adapter from the Roku Player. This will completely turn it off.,


If your TV provides power through the HDMI port, then all you should have to do is remove the stick, and then your Roku will be turned off.

Restart your device.,

Address errors by number.,
Check your Internet's download speed.,
Try using an Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi.",How to Troubleshoot Streaming Issues on Hulu," Sometimes the entire Hulu service will crash or undergo maintenance in your area. You can diagnose this problem by using a tool like DownDetector (http://downdetector.com/status/hulu) to see if others are experiencing technical difficulties.

You can also check Hulu's social media accounts to see if they have released any official statements.
If Hulu's problems are affecting people outside of your own home network, chances are you'll have to wait out the issues until they're solved on Hulu's end.;
, If Hulu opens incorrectly, it may not load all of the information needed to properly run. Restarting the Hulu app, stream, or browser may solve this issue.

If you're viewing Hulu in a browser, instead refresh your browser by clicking the circular arrow located at the top of the browser window.

, If your browser or device has any programs running while you're attempting to use Hulu, your connection will likely be affected. Closing these items will speed up your videos' load times and potentially improve quality., If you're running into performance issues or your Hulu videos refuse to play, your browser may be due for an update.

Most browsers will alert you to an update's availability when you connect to the Internet.
If you're using a mobile device, you can check your phone's or tablet's app store for an update.

, This is doable by opening the Hulu app from within your device's settings and then selecting the ""Clear Cache"" option. Clearing the cache may remove out-of-date files that interfere with Hulu working.

If you can't clear Hulu's cache, delete and then reinstall the Hulu app.
If you're using Hulu in a browser, instead clear your browser's data cache.

, Similarly to Hulu not properly loading all elements on start-up, sometimes your device improperly configures its connection settings on start-up. Restarting your device may fix this problem., If an Ethernet connection is out of the question due to router placement, moving closer to the router may help.

Ensuring that there aren't any walls, floors, or other items between you and the router will also improve connection settings.

, You can do so by selecting the gear icon in the video's player and then choosing a lower quality than is currently playing.

You can also select Auto to let Hulu determine playback quality based on minute-to-minute connection speed.

, Your Internet speed will drop with each device you connect to your Wi-Fi. For optimal streaming, make sure other devices (e.g., phones or other computers) aren't using Wi-Fi while you're watching Hulu.

This is especially important if another person in your home is downloading large files or gaming, since both are high-bandwidth activities that will impact your streaming experience.

, Depending on the error number or message, your response will vary:


3343, 3322, 3307, 2203, 3321 - Clear your browser's cache. If you're using the Hulu app, try uninstalling and then reinstalling it.

3370 (Chrome) - Click ⋮, click Settings, click Show advanced settings, open the Content settings below ""Privacy"", and check the ""Allow sites to play protected content"" box.

500 - Restart your browser or Hulu app. This is an error with the webpage itself, so you may have to wait for the error to be resolved on Hulu's end.

Restarting or looping content - This is a common issue with Blu-Ray players. You may have to switch to a different device on which to view Hulu content.

, If your Internet's maximum download speed (which is named on your Internet plan) isn't high enough to support playing videos, you'll encounter slow playback speed. You'll need the following speeds for the following resolutions:720p - 3 MB/s

1080p - 6 MB/s

4K - 13 MB/s

, By attaching the computer or console on which you're viewing Hulu to your router via Ethernet cable, you'll stabilize the Internet connection.

You can't do this on a mobile device.
If you still encounter streaming issues while your device is directly connected to the router, your router is most likely the problem.

Know the rules.,
Determine your objective.,
Prepare your elevator speech.,
Bring professional business cards.,
Plan to arrive slightly early.",How to Understand Speed Networking1," Most speed networking events adhere to a general format: one group remains stationary while a second group rotates from person to person, allowing for every potential pair to meet and talk briefly. Individual events may have particular rules and specifications, including the length of time you have to speak to each person. Familiarize yourself with these rules before the event.;
, Due to time constraints, you must be cautious about the information you choose to discuss with each person. Strategize by thinking about what you want to get from the event. Are you looking for a new job? Are you searching for a business partner? Do you need new suppliers? Having a clear sense of your objective will help you choose your topics of discussion wisely.

, An “elevator speech” is a very brief pitch that explains who you are and what you do – the term is connected to the idea that you should be able to convey this information to people in the time it takes you to ride on an elevator. The length of your elevator speech can vary depending on how much time you are given to speak. If, for example, you have five minutes, then plan for a thirty-second speech. Remember that the other person will also need to speak, and then you’ll want time for a conversation. Your elevator speech should include:


A basic introduction, with your name and current title. For example, you might say, “Hi, I’m Jane Smith. I’m the CEO of ABC Pool Company.”
A brief explanation of what you do and what you value. For example, you might say, “I manage the general operations for my company in order to help homeowners build the pools and pool areas of their dreams.”
A brief explanation of why you are speed networking. For example, you might say, “I am here today to make some connections. I’d like to find some individuals who can assist me in increasing my market share.”

, As with any networking event, it’s important to show up for a speed networking event with a stack of business cards. Plan to distribute them to every person you meet.


If you do not have formal business cards from your employer (or if you are unemployed), you can design them yourself. Use a professional template, and include your name, title, area of expertise, and contact information.

, Get to the event a few minutes early. Doing so ensures that you can start the rotation on time, without interfering with any logistical plans.

, Smiling makes you seem approachable and helps you make a positive first impression. In addition, smiles can be contagious; you’ll affect the attitude of those around you.

, When it is time for you to speak, smile, offer a firm handshake, and introduce yourself. Give your brief elevator speech. Aim to be calm, confident, and positive.

, When it is time for the other person to speak, listen carefully. Remember that this person is charged with listening to you; you owe the person the same courtesy. Besides, this person may be a good connection for you to have.

, People love to talk about themselves. After the other person’s elevator speech, take the time to ask a few open-ended questions. Actively listen to the answers, and strive to create a conversation that could be mutually beneficial. Exchanging ideas and learning about one another may yield an important connection.

, If you are comfortable taking notes, feel free to do so. This will help you retain information about each person (more than what is on the business card). Your notes might include:


Names of other people to contact.
Company names.
Shared ideas.
Items for your to-do list.

, Exchanging business cards is important during a networking event because it leaves each person with valuable contact information. You can use this information to connect with the person in the future.

, There are various ways to end each brief meeting on a positive note. In general, you should shake hands and thank each person for his or her time. In addition, you might say something like “good luck” or “nice talking with you.” If you’ve agreed to do something for the person or contact them again, affirm your plan to do so: “I will email my contact and get back to you shortly.”

, After the speed networking event is over, you should follow up with people with whom you had positive or productive conversations, even if you cannot assist each other with anything immediately. Follow through on anything you promised to others, including sharing information or introducing them to others. Helping other people reach their networking goals will make you feel good, but it will also make a lasting business connection who may later return the favor.

Download and install Soulseek if you haven't already.,

,
You should see a field that says ""Listening Port:"", Slsk (short for Soulseek) selects a random port, but you can change it to any port you like.,
This will open up a webbrowser.,
If your computer is connected to a router chances are the incoming port needs to be forwarded to your computer.,
If you have more than 1 computer connected to the router, you will need to assign the computer you are using Soulseek a static IP address.,
Open up your router administration control and assign the listening port to be forwarded to the IP address your computer receives from the router.,
Restart your Soulseek client if you have changed your listening port.

",How to Optimize Soulseek for Downloading Music,";
,, Beside this field there is a button that says ""Test firewall and router settings"".

, Unless the page says ""Your router and Soulseek client is configured correctly."", you can improve your configuration.

, This is a basic problem with using a router. To briefly describe this issue, when you are connected to your ISP through either your cable or DSL modem, you are given 1 IP (Internet Protocol) address. If you have a router, you have the ability to connect multiple computers to the internet using that one 1 IP address (ex: 69.48.100.5). Now when an incoming connection request arrives for a given port, in this case 2234, the router doesn't know which computer to send the request to (even if you only have 1 computer!), because it could be any of the computer connected to the router. So to fix this problem you need to set up port forwarding to on your router.

, See the website PortForward.com for information on assigning a static IP address. If you only have 1 computer connected to the router, chances are it receives the same internal IP address each time it connects. (Ex: 192.168.0.1), so you can skip this step.

, For each router this is explained in detail at PortForward. Pick your router and go through the steps that they list.

Find a list of web-based proxy sites.,
Connect to the proxy site.,
Enter in the address for the blocked site you want to access.,
Wait for the site to load.",How to Access Blocked Websites1," A ""proxy"" is a server that you route your Internet traffic through. This typically requires configuring your browser, which may not be possible on the computer you're using. A web-based proxy is a website that runs on a proxy server. You connect to the website, and then the website connects to the site that is normally blocked from you. It then shows you the blocked site as it work as third person between you and website.


There are countless sites with lists of web proxies. They are available with a quick search (""web proxy list"") using your favorite search engine. Note that many of these list sites are also blocked, so you may need to dig deep or access the lists on another computer. Another way is by accessing a proxy with its IP instead of domain, as some network filtering does not filter IP websites.;
, Select one of the sites on the list and open it in your browser. If it's a popular site, there's a chance that it will be blocked too. If that's the case, you'll need to try another site on the list.


Web proxy sites are updated constantly, so you should eventually be able to find one that hasn't been blocked yet.

, Nearly all web proxy sites have a field where you can enter in the URL (address) of the site you want to visit. For example, if you are trying to visit YouTube, you would enter www.youtube.com.

, Connecting to a blocked site through a web proxy will be slower than if you were visiting the site directly. This is because the web proxy has to download the blocked website and then transfer it to you. There may be errors in the page for parts that didn't transfer correctly.


It is highly recommended that you don't use a web proxy for any websites that you need to log into, as you never know who might be seeing the information between you and the proxy. If you need to connect to a secure site, see the ""Creating Your Own Proxy at Home"" section below.

Download a portable browser.,
Install the portable browser onto your USB drive.,
Find a proxy to connect to.,
Change the proxy settings of your portable browser.,
Take the portable browser with you.",How to Access Blocked Websites3," A portable web browser is installed on a USB drive. This drive can then be inserted into any computer, and the browser can be run from the drive, without having to install it on the computer you are using. A portable browser is handy because you can change the proxy connection settings, which are usually disabled on school or work computers.


The most popular portable browser is Firefox. you will need to download the portable version from PortableApps.com., Insert a USB drive with at least 100 MB of free space into your computer. Run the Firefox portable installation file that you downloaded, and set the installation location to the USB drive you inserted. Installation should only take a few moments.

, In order to use the portable browser to bypass a block on a website, you will need a proxy server to connect to. Much like the web-based proxy in the previous section, a proxy server retrieves the blocked site for you and then transfers the data to your portable browser. Instead of doing this through a website interface, you will be changing the address that your browser connects to, affecting your entire browsing session.


There are hundreds of lists online of proxy servers that you can connect to. You will need to look these up on a computer that doesn't block these sites.
Copy down the hostname or IP address of the proxy, along with the port.
If you create your own proxy at home, you can use your portable browser to connect to it. This is the most secure option, but also the most time-intensive. See the next section for details on creating your own proxy at home.

, Launch the portable Firefox and click the Menu (☰) button. Select ""Options"", and then click the Network tab.


Click Settings... in the Connection section of the Network tab.
Select ""Manual proxy configuration""
Enter the proxy hostname or IP address into the ""HTTP Proxy"" field.
Enter the port into the ""Port"" field.
Click OK to save your settings.

, Next time you are using a computer that blocks the website you want to access, pop your portable browser into the USB drive of the computer and start up portable Firefox. You should then be able to connect to the blocked website.


If you are using a proxy obtained from a list on the internet, it will likely go offline soon. Free proxies online never last, and your portable browser will need to be updated often.
It is highly recommended that you don't use any proxy you find online for any websites that you need to log into, as you never know who might be seeing the information between you and the proxy. If you need to connect to a secure site, see the ""Creating Your Own Proxy at Home"" section below.

Download and install a web server.,
Download and install PHProxy.,
Test out the proxy.,
Find your computer's IP address.,
Forward port 80 on your router.,
Find your public IP.,
Connect to your proxy server.",How to Access Blocked Websites4," The most secure and foolproof way to bypass any web restriction is to install a proxy on your own web server. You can actually install a web server on your home computer, and then connect to that from anywhere as long as the computer is on. Installing your own web server is actually quite straightforward. WAMPServer is the easiest solution for Windows users, while Mac users can use MAMP.


Once you install WAMPServer, you will see its icon in your System Tray.
Right-click on the icon and select ""Put Online"". This will turn your server on.
Right-click the icon again and select ""Localhost"". If the WAMPServer configuration page appears, then the server was installed correctly.

, This is an open-source proxy server program that is free to download and use. You can download PHProxy from SourceForge. Ensure that you download from SourceForge, otherwise you may get a modified version.



Extract the folder from the .ZIP file that you download.
Copy the folder to the WAMP (or MAMP) root directory. The default locations of this directory are:

Windows - C:\wamp\www\

OS X - Applications/MAMP/htdocs/




, PHProxy is installed simply by copying the folder to the right location. Open a web browser on your computer and navigate to http://localhost/phproxy/ to test the proxy. If the PHProxy page appears, then everything was installed correctly.

, In order to access the server from anywhere in the world, you are going to have to direct incoming traffic to the server on your home network. To do this, you will first need to find the private IP address of the computer running the server software.


Open the Command Prompt and type ipconfig. Your private IP address will be listed in the section for your current connection. See this guide for more details on finding your private IP address.
Note the IP address, you will need it on the next step.

, When you connect to your server from another location, you will be attempting to connect through port 80 on your home network's router. Ports control the flow of data into and out of your network. In order to connect to your server, you'll need to open port 80 to allow incoming connections.


Open your router's configuration page. You can do this using a web browser on your local network. Enter the router's address in the browser's address bar. See this guide for detailed instructions on accessing your router.
Open the Port Forwarding section. This may be labeled a little differently depending on your router manufacturer. Create a new rule for your server's private IP address. Make sure the range of ports is set to just port 80, and that both TCP and UDP traffic are enabled. See this guide for more detailed instructions on forwarding ports.

, Now that port forwarding is all set up, your web server is complete and ready to use. All you'll need to connect to it from anywhere is your network's public IP address. THis is the address that designates your network on the greater internet.


You can quickly find your public IP address by opening Google on the web server computer and typing my ip. Your public IP address will be displayed at the top of the results list.

, Now that you know the address, you can connect to your proxy server from anywhere. Your home proxy server will load the page that you request, and then transfer the data to you.To connect to PHProxy and use the web interface, simply enter Public IP/phproxy/. For example, if your network's public IP is 10.10.10.15, you can access PHProxy from anywhere by entering 10.10.10.15/phproxy/ into a browser's address bar.
To connect to your proxy server using a portable browser, configure the browser's connection settings to use your proxy's public IP address and port 80.

Avoid using public networks.,
Avoid using public computers.,
Do not give out your passwords.,
Avoid downloading unknown applications.",How to Avoid Becoming a Victim of Cybercrime1," Refrain from connecting to free Wi-Fi networks from coffee shops or other public places. Connecting your device to public networks exposes it potential hackers that can easily get through the low level security of these kinds of networks.;
, If you’re about to do some personal transactions like banking or online shopping, do not do it using public computers. Other people who have used the computers before you may have put programs that can record the passwords you type in.

, Keep the passwords of your various accounts to yourself. If you do let someone know, make sure to change it afterwards to prevent that person from accessing your private internet accounts without permission.

, The Internet is full of free softwares from unknown sources. These kinds of programs normally carry malicious applications with it and installing it may infect and cause serious damage to your computer.

Check that the connection works.",How to Use SSH," For Windows, you will need to download and install an SSH client program. The most popular one is Cygwin, which is available for free from the developer’s website. Download and install it like you would any other program. Another popular free program is PuTTY.During the Cygwin installation, you must choose to install OpenSSH from the Net section.
Linux and Mac OS X come with SSH already installed on the system. This is because SSH is a UNIX system, and Linux and OS X are derived from UNIX.
If you have Windows 10 with the Anniversary Update, you can install the Windows Subsystem for Linux which comes with SSH preinstalled.;
, Open the terminal program that is installed by Cygwin, or Bash on Ubuntu on Windows for Windows 10, or open the Terminal in OS X or Linux. SSH uses the terminal interface to interact with other computers. There is no graphical interface for SSH, so you will need to get comfortable typing in commands.

, Before you dive into creating secure keys and moving files, you’ll want to test that SSH is properly configured on your computer as well as the system you are connecting to. Enter the following command, replacing <username> with your username on the remote computer, and <remote> with the address for the remote computer or server:


$ ssh <username>@<remote>
You will be asked for your password once the connection is established. You will not see the cursor move or any characters input when you type your password.
If this step fails, then either SSH is configured incorrectly on your computer or the remote computer is not accepting SSH connections.

, When you first connect to the remote computer, you should be located in your HOME directory. To move around the directory structure, use the cd command:cd .. will move you up one directory.

cd <directoryname> will move you into the specified subdirectory.

cd /home/directory/path/ will move you into the specified directory from the root (home).

cd ~ will return you to your HOME directory.

, To see what files and folders in your current location, you can use the ls command:ls will list all of the files and folders in your current directory.

ls –l will list the contents of the directory along with additional information such as size, permissions, and date.

ls-a will list all the contents including hidden files and folders.

, If you need to copy files from your local computer to the computer you are accessing remotely, you can use the scp command:



scp /localdirectory/example1.txt <username>@<remote>:<path> will copy example1.txt to the specified <path> on the remote computer. You can leave <path> blank to copy to the root folder of the remote computer.

scp <username>@<remote>:/home/example1.txt ./ will move example1.txt from the home directory on the remote computer to the current directory on the local computer.

, You can use the cp command to make copies of files either in the same directory or into a directory of your choosing:



cp example1.txt example2.txt will create a copy of example1.txt called example2.txt in the same location.

cp example1.txt <directory>/ will create a copy of example1.txt in the location specified by <directory>.

, If you want to change a file’s name or move it without copying, you can use the mv command:



mv example1.txt example2.txt will rename example1.txt to example2.txt. The file will stay in the same location.

mv directory1 directory2 will rename directory1 to directory2. The directory’s contents will remain unchanged.

mv example1.txt directory1/ will move example1.txt into directory1.

mv example1.txt directory1/example2.txt will move example1.txt into directory1 and rename it to example2.txt

, If you need to remove anything from the computer you are connected to, you can use the rm command:



rm example1.txt will delete the file example1.txt.

rm –I example1.txt will delete the file example1.txt after prompting you to confirm.

rm directory1/ will delete directory1 and all of its contents.

, You can change the read and write privileges of your files using the chmod command:



chmod u+w example1.txt will add the write (modify) permission to the file for the user (u). You can also use the g modifier for group permissions or the o for world permissions.

chmod g+r example1.txt will add the read (access) permission to the file for the group.
There are a large list of permissions that you can use to secure or open various aspects of your system., There are a few more important commands that you will be using quite a bit in the shell interface. They include:



mkdir newdirectory will create a new subdirectory called newdirectory.

pwd will display your current directory location.

who shows who is logged into the system.

pico newfile.txt or vi newfile.txt will create a new file and open the file editor. Different system will have different file editors installed. The most common are pico and vi. You may need to use different commands if you have a different file editor installed.

, If you are unsure as to what a command will do, you can use the man command to learn about all of the possible uses and parameters:



man <command> will display information about that command.

man –k <keyword> will search all of the man pages for the keyword you specify., These keys will allow you to connect to the remote location without having to enter your password each time. This is a much more secure way to connect to the remote computer, as the password will not have to transmitted over the network.


Create the key folder on your computer by entering the command $ mkdir .ssh

Create the public and private keys by using the command $ ssh-keygen –t rsa

You will be asked if you would like to create a passphrase for the keys; this is optional. If you don’t want to create a passphrase, press Enter. This will create two keys in the .ssh directory: id_rsa and id_rsa.pub
Change your private key’s permissions. In order to ensure that the private key is only readable by you, enter the command $ chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa


, Once your keys are created, you’re ready to place the public key on the remote computer so that you can connect without a password. Enter the following command, replacing the appropriate parts as explained earlier:


$ scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub <username>@<remote>:
Make sure to include the colon (:) at the end of the command.
You will be asked to input your password before the file transfer starts.

, Once you’ve placed the key on the remote computer, you will need to install it so that it works correctly. First, log in to the remote computer the same way that you did in Step 3.


Create an SSH folder on the remote computer, if it does not already exist: $ mkdir .ssh

Append your key to the authorized keys file. If the file does not exist yet, it will be created: $ cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys

Change the permissions for the SSH folder to allow access: $ chmod 700 .ssh


, Once the key has been installed on the remote computer, you should be able to initiate a connection without being asked to enter your password. Enter the following command to test the connection: $ ssh <username>@<remote>


If you connect without being prompted for the password, then the keys are configured correctly.

Legitimate newsletters, website administration emails (password resets, authentication requests, etc.), and more may come from addresses you don’t recognize.;
, Only click links from trusted senders. The entire purpose of spam is to get you to click a link. If an email contains a link and you don’t recognize the sender, chances are it is spam. Hover your mouse over any link to see the destination in your browser or email client’s status bar.

, Spam often contains misspellings and oddly-worded sentences. This can include bizarre capitalization and weird punctuation. Many have gibberish at the end of the message.

, Anything that claims you won a contest you never entered, offers you access to unclaimed money, or promises free electronics, jewelry, or anything 100% free is never legitimate. Any message that asks for your password is never real (all legitimate websites have automated password reset programs). Requests from strangers should always be ignored.


Many email services have a preview window, which will allow you to read an email message without opening it.

, Malware and viruses are often disguised as email attachments. Never download an attachment from a sender that you do not trust or were not expecting., “Robots” (scripts created to scrape websites for addresses) can quickly gather thousands of emails at a time from websites where the email addresses are made public. Also, sometimes humans actually grab e-mails off websites to use them for sign-up offers in order to get free stuff (iPods, Ringtones, Televisions, etc.)., If you must provide contact information, try writing it out in creative ways (me yahoo com). There are alternative ways of displaying your e-mail address while making it hard for spambots to harvest it. Such methods include using image picture of your e-mail address or using JavaScript to dynamically construct the display of your email.

, Usernames are almost always public, and it’s simply a matter of figuring out the correct service to add at the end. Services such as Yahoo! Chat make this even easier, since chances are everyone using it has a @yahoo.com email address. Avoid using a chatroom that is tied to your email address.

, Have one main account, and then make a separate account for different purposes (one for friends, one for entertainment sites, one for your financial websites, etc.).


In gmail, you can add a ""+"" button to your email address. For example, you can signup for newsletters like JohnDoe+Newsletters@gmail.com if your email address is JohnDoe@gmail.com
Set all those addresses to forward the mail to your main account so that you do not have to check multiple accounts.
If you start receiving spam through one of your alternates, you can trace it to one of your disposable addresses and simply delete that account.

, Replying or clicking the “Unsubscribe” link will only generate more spam, because they now know that the email address is valid. It is best to report and delete the spam using the steps in the section below., A current spam attack involves “essay spammers.” This involves spammers inserting random links to sites related to essay-writing services. Another spam attack known as spambots creates random pages related to subjects like UGG Boots. These pages also include random links to other subjects, whether or not they are related to the subject or even placed in a grammatically coherent way.

Reduce the chances that you'll end up spamming others.",How to Protect Your Web Accounts from Being Hacked," When signing up for an e-mail account or any other account on the internet, make use of all the verification processes it provides. These are usually additional layers of information that is known only to you. The verification processes provided include things such as Phone Verification, SMS Verification and answering specific security questions. Do your research on finding a secure email account, depending on your personal needs; there are reviews available from other users if you do online searches.


Be aware that the email service provider you're using will have its own security measures, hence no particular one is set out here. Simply follow the instructions that are aimed at securing your account as tightly as possible. If you are trying to use an email account that lacks security features, reconsider using it at all.
Be aware that no email service is 100 percent safe. Do everything possible to make hacking very difficult.;
, If you include a number with your name or an unusual word, etc., it makes it harder for someone to simply guess your name by adding your first and last names together and emailing.

, Do not give it to anybody else, do not store it in your email Drafts folder and do not store it where it can be accessed. Your password is valuable, so treat it as such and keep it confidential.


Tighten up the security of your account. Add an extra phone number and alternative email address for a password recovery if somehow your account is hacked and the password has been changed. Add security questions related to password recovery so you can recover your hacked password later on.

, If you receive a message from your email provider that they are concerned about the email being compromised, follow it up. Read it carefully though, as if the email itself is a scam, it will have giveaway signs such as bad grammar, illegitimate/spoofed logos, a click-on link to change a password (do not click, always change a password from the account itself), etc.


If you are suspicious that an email from your email provider isn't real, contact the email company directly, either by phone or by a separate email sent through their actual website. Wait to hear back from them before responding to the suspicious email. Some companies have email abuse or inquiry departments; check their website for more information.

, If you want an account where you can be less careless, such as for leaving your email address all over the internet, etc., use a separate one intended just for that and leave nothing personal or sensitive on it, ever. Keep your personal email account secure using the suggestions above but also by not giving it to many people, other than those you trust.

, If you receive emails promising prizes, wins, money exchanges, eternal love, etc., then be very suspicious. Never click on a link promising such things and never reply to the email either. Delete the message without actioning it any further.

, This is only provided for those who want to sign-up for Facebook. Use your original identity and information to sign-up for an Facebook account. Follow all of the account verification processes provided to make your account secure.

, Do not share it with anyone, do not store it in your mail inbox or anywhere on Facebook or online. Don't share your password with friends. If you log on at a cyber cafe or similar, always remember to log right back off when you finish (better yet, don't use a public computer at all).

, If possible, avoid checking your social networking accounts on anything but your own devices. But if you have no choice, consider the following:


Never click ""keep me logged in"", or similar long-term access checks, when entering the site.
Be aware of who is around you when you key in your password. Cover the keys if you feel safer.
Be discreet and don't attract attention while using the site. Curiosity can lead some people to want to fiddle just because...
Always remember to log out when you're done. Just get into the habit of going through a list in your head of ""log in, do not check stay logged in, log out"" when using public access devices.

, Before installing any (if you really must), do research into the reliability, safety and track record of the third party app. Ask friends, ask questions in forums, etc., to reassure yourself of its safety. If you have any doubts, don't install it.

, For example, in Facebook, you can check the box that states ""Browse Facebook on a secure connection (https) when possible"". Enable login notifications––this will alert you should anyone other than yourself attempt to log in to your Facebook account. Enable login approvals too; this will require a special security code to be added should the account be opened from an unknown browser. You'll get a text message should such an attempt be made. And if you like, you can add trusted contacts who can help you get back on the site if you are hacked; simply check and fill the Trusted Contacts field.


Other social networking accounts have security settings too. Spend time checking these out and enabling what you feel protects you best.

, In accounts such as Facebook, only allow friends to see your stuff; that way any ""friends of friends"" who might be less friendly in intent won't be able to see your account.


Whatever your social networking account, don't share your account with unknown people. In Facebook as well as Twitter, there is an option by which you can keep your account hidden from the general public, although your profile name will be shown. This option can be found in ""Privacy settings "" in Facebook and 'Settings ' in Twitter.
Only share video, photo and other content with friends.
In Facebook, change the timeline and tagging to be friends only.
Friend only those people you really know. If you don't know the person, assume it's safest not including them in your Facebook account.

, A hacker can access your account by using an attack called 'dictionary attack', in which all of the words from a standard dictionary of the English language is placed in the password box and after a while, the password may be revealed and a hack will occur. To reduce the possibility of a dictionary attack, add numbers, alphabets and even symbols (!@#$%^&) altogether. If the site allows for it, use a pass phrase with numbers and symbols too - this is even harder to crack, although it's not provided as an option as often as passwords.


An example: Suppose you have the password 'Hello to you' (without the quotes). This could be hacked within an hour or less using a dictionary attack. However, if you modify it to something like: '#ello2u' (without the quotes), it would take more than 1 month or even a year to crack and the hacker is going to give up and look for an easier target.

, For example many people have the tendency of keeping the password as '<your own="""" name="""">', or 'password' or 'password123' , '<your girlfriend="""" boyfriend="""" name=""""> '. People trying to access your account will use the obvious examples first.


There are password strength checkers available online for you to test a range of passwords before using them. This can help you work out what is as strong as possible each time.

, Don't be so confident about your strong password. It can also be hacked within a month, so if you have a persistent hacker who really wants to get your information, make it hard by constantly changing your password. This process must be processed at a minimum of every 3-4 months, more often if possible. It is a good way to keep your memory in shape too!

, Doing this could be the greatest pitfall ever, for if a hacker comes to know your Facebook password, the obvious next step is to input this password into other accounts in the hope you've been lazy and used the same one over and over. If you have, then bingo! Your whole web life could be wiped out.

, Keep a record of account information such as email ID, phone numbers you've provided, alternative email addresses given and security questions with answers. Keep this information in a safe and secure place, such as on a piece of paper stored in your home. Some sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, allow you to download such information to your computer, so you might like to do this every 3 to 4 months.


Password lists: This is a touchy subject. Most advice is to keep passwords in your head. The reality is that many people cannot do this effectively, especially if you need different passwords for dozens or even hundreds of sites. Find a sensible way to keep copies of such passwords safely, such as paper written lists (for example, divide into different lists, keep in different places), not writing down passwords for your most used accounts (those ones ought to be easily remembered) or only writing down passwords for accounts that have no sensitive information when entered, etc. You'll need to devise a safe way that works for you, bearing in mind that many sites offer password retrieval to cover forgetfulness.
Be aware that if you keep lists of passwords etc. on your computer, and your computer is hacked, all of the listed accounts may be compromised.
Use a good code to keep any stored personal reminder information safe from being read. You can make it up or learn one; the idea is that unless you're harboring an important state secret, most hackers won't persist with anything that is simply too much effort.

, Spam can occur when your email or social networking account is hacked and your list of contacts is used to send on spam from your address/account. Ways to avoid this happening include having a strong password so your account cannot be hacked, not adding friends in Facebook whom you don't know, not clicking on links in emails from people you don't know, etc.


Never reply to emails that land in your spam folder. Delete them immediately. By replying, even in a gesture of humor, you confirm your existence and you'll just keep getting more spam from the sender.

Write decent profiles.,
Avoid poor spelling and grammar.,
Share things that are fun and productive.",How to Protect Your Online Reputation1," Whenever you join a site that allows you to add a good profile, use each profile opportunity as a chance to show your best side. Write the profiles carefully, highlighting the things about you that really matter to you and that you'd like other people to acknowledge you for.


Try to be consistent concerning the information that you provide in profiles. As things change, keep these profiles updated.
Be sure to complete everything that is asked for, such as images, bio, and importantly, a link back to your web site.;
, Thoroughly proofread and copyedit any online postings or resumes before submitting them. In most cases, employers frown upon and likely will turn down hiring you if your resume or other important applications are littered with mistakes. Additionally, your friends, family, or coworkers who can see your social network posts may find consistent grammatical errors annoying.

, This means sharing information, photos, videos, and other online items that reflect well on you and improve the general nature of online communications. Things that are not productive include embarrassing photos of you or others (in the latter case, you show poor judgment in hurting someone else's feelings), defamatory or degrading content, filthy jokes, crass comments, flaming or trolling commentary, and so forth. If it's negative, degrading, and hurtful, it's unproductive and will saddle you with a poor reputation.


Focus on shining when online. What good things can you say about others? What fun and interesting information can you enlighten others with? In what ways can you share entertaining things with others that are thoughtful and considerate?
Take responsibility for the images, information, stories, and videos that you share online. Your friends, followers, and family expect this, just as you expect it of them.

Think before you click.,
Always be polite.",How to Protect Your Online Reputation2," Consider what effects a simple status update or blog posting could have on your reputation in the long run.


Always ask yourself, ""How would I feel if my boss, parents, grandmother, and spouse saw this piece?"" Chances are, they probably will see it.
Are you feeling angry, upset, frustrated, or just plain bored? Don't post anything until you feel more balanced and can think straight about what you're writing.
Remember that once it's posted, it can't be taken back. Daring yourself to ""just put it out there"" can have long-lasting consequences. Go get a glass of water and sit down away from the computer first...

, Approach all online interactions with your manners at the forefront. Have the attitude that most people are acting in good faith and the stupid things said online are often a result of not thinking, making errors or simply having an off-moment. And where people are deliberately provocative, don't stoop to their level; unlike real life heated exchanges, written spats are etched in stone.


Never flame anyone or respond to flamers; it's usually all about them and you're not only feeding their egos but ruining your own reputation at the same time.
Never feed the trolls. Some people love to bait others and watch the destruction unfold. If you don't respond, they'll stop messing about with you and no nasty record will be left online.
Accept where you've slipped up and said stupid things. Where possible, leave an apology. It can go a long way to showing you're capable of realizing and acting on your faults.
Don't harbor ill will toward a person offline. Carrying your annoyance offline is likely to develop into a bad reputation.
Be civil even when you feel uncivil. If this isn't possible, get off the computer until you've cooled down. It is that easy.

Modify privacy and search settings on your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or other social network accounts.,
Take advantage of the privacy features on your blog or personal website.,
Go incognito online.",How to Protect Your Online Reputation3," Ensure that only friends with whom you don't mind sharing your personal life or photos will have access to that information.


If you don't want your boss or coworkers to see your profile, change your privacy settings to reflect that.
Be very careful what you share with ""friends"". Only very close, well known friends who can be trusted enough not to share very personal details should have access to them; even then you might want to think about keeping such private information in real life only.
Unless you've known one another for years in a social context, your boss and coworkers are not your close friends. They may be very nice people but you never can tell, so share wisely.

, Monitor your site frequently, especially if you allow public (visitor) comments, and remove anything offensive or inappropriate as soon as possible.


Always prefer the approve-before-publication feature of your blog or website. Why let nasty stuff fly when it can be ditched before it even gets published? Cut off the lifeline of people who want to spread half-baked truths, rumors and malicious gossip. Your reputation will be all the better for it.
That said, respond positively and openly to constructive criticism. Negative posts that are written without a view to being malicious or curse-filled deserve your response most times. This ensures openness and reveals to people that you're willing to defend what matters to you.

, Use an alias or alternate email address to post comments or make edits inconspicuously. However, be careful about the trail you leave. Some people love nothing better than recognizing similarities between the person they know you to be and your alias' behavior.


Never use anonymity or alias status to be mean-spirited, nasty or to behave like a troll. If you can't stand up for what you want to say and say it in a constructive and caring manner, then it's best left unsaid, and your reputation will thank you for it. The risk of being uncovered increases with the level of nastiness, and if you defame or threaten someone, legal authorities may become involved and you will most likely get caught.

Search for yourself.,
Consider what you can do to make changes to your online reputation where it lets you down.,
Seek legal advice if the reputation-diminishing issue of search engine returns is highly damaging or endangering your life.",How to Protect Your Online Reputation4," What is coming back right now? Are you happy with it? What aspects of it do you think could be improved? What aspects do you consider are currently problematic?


Do you even have a reputation online? No digital presence can be viewed by tech-savvy employers as odd and possibly decrease your chances of employment.
Use Google Alerts, Yahoo Alerts, etc. to bring back anything with your name in it. If your name is commonplace, include other identifying factors linked just to you, such as your hometown, your business name, your job title or a hobby you actively participate in, etc., or you'll get snowed under with every other return for Joe Smith and Jane White too!
There are online services that can track your comments trail (forums, message boards, blogs, etc.), check your Twitter reputation, search blogs for your name, etc. There are sites that show when people have searched for you or asked questions about you. Focus on what you know you're most active on, then work your way down the list.

, In many cases, this may be as simple as deleting a profile or messages from specific sites and waiting out the time for the search engine to stop returning these as top returns (in some instances, you can apply to have removal of search returns sped up). In other cases, you may need to seek professional help to get bad returns from continuing.


Contact a person who has uploaded damaging images, information or videos of you first. Ask that person nicely to remove it. Don't use curse words or rude statements––keep it clear, simple and factual and ask the other person to kindly remove the offending information.
Contact webmasters of sites to ask that your details or offending information be removed.If you can't find details on the website for a webmaster, check Whois for more information. In some cases, the webmaster may ignore or refuse your request, or you won't be able to find the webmaster at all (it does happen). In which, case, keep trying while doing other positive things.
Google suggests overriding the negative with the positive if your initial search engine returns are not flattering. This means posting lots of positive things using your name or uploading positive profiles, information, running groups, creating blogs, writing white papers, create a website with your name or business as the domain name, conducting interviews on podcasts, writing think pieces, etc. to try to drown out the less flattering stuff. This suggestion sounds helpful but can be easier said than done, especially where the sites holding reputation-damaging information are high in the search engine returns and for one reason or other, you can't remove, have wiped or change the information yourself. It also requires time, something you may have precious little of or interest in investing.

, There is a point at which self-help is useless and you may need legal advice and help to make substantial changes. Especially when dealing with search engines that don't make it easy to contact them...


There are companies that specialize in online reputation management. They can be pricey, but they might be important for some cases.

, Looking around the area you work in can reveal a number of hazards that can be dealt with, easily provided you follow through checking them methodically. Here are some suggested activities:


Check the batteries in your computer room's smoke detectors. Update them if needed. Install them immediately if you have none.
Check for fire extinguishers. Do you have them near your computing and server equipment in case of a fire?
Place monitors, keyboard and other computer equipment on anti-slip mats where needed.

Have you got power surge protectors in place for all computers and related equipment? If not, buy some today and install them immediately.

, Whenever you leave your room or office, can other people access or remove your computing equipment? If so, consider instituting practices that will prevent them from doing anything with your computer:


Put computer security posters in the office or room to remind everyone of their security responsibilities.
Use passwords to prevent unwanted access to computers.
Attach computers to the wall or heavy equipment by means of locks in order to prevent them from being removed. This is especially important for laptops and notebooks.

, A cluttered workspace and messy office can be the cause of sloppy work practices in relation to confidential information and the more at ease everyone has become with leaving confidential information lying about, the harder it becomes to break the slack cycle. Jump on it now!


Vacuum the computer keyboard and computer area to remove dust build-up. Wipe down the screens with anti-static wipes.
Ensure that all dust, including chalk dust, is not covering or inside computers and related equipment. Also remove pet dander, especially if your cat has a habit of sleeping next to your computer as you work.
Clean the heads on disk drives and other magnetic media drives.

, For every computer owned, back up the data. If you don't already back-up regularly, make today the day to draw up a plan to remind yourself to make regular back-ups, or use a program that will do this for you automatically.


Develop a total recovery plan for all computer systems that might need one.
Consider having several sources of back-up - online, cloud, USB sticks, hard drives, etc.
Check that trouble logs are in place on each computer and are being used and followed up.

, Carrying laptops, notebooks, and electronic data gadgets can lead you into trouble if you don't pay adequate attention. Things to do include:


Never leave a laptop or other electronic gadget in open sight in a car. Always store out of sight, or preferably, take it with you. And lock your car, even if all you're doing is paying for gas.
Remember to pick up your laptop, USB stick, or other electronic gadget after using it. Leaving it behind on a bar, in a cafe, or at someone else's house allows anyone access to the information on the item.
Avoid carrying laptops and notebooks openly in places where mugging and pickpocketing is known. While this is mainly of concern when traveling, always keep your wits about you.
Avoid placing open liquids such as soda or coffee near your computer. Spills can be very costly, not to mention dangerous to your data!

If you install another browser that isn't already shown in this article, you can write an article about it and help wikiHow be more informative.

,
Link this article to yours, or just come back to this article then update it with the new information about how you determine your new browser's type and version.

,
Use the knowledge you already have and expand it here if you'd like!

,
Contact someone from wikiHow.",How to Find Your Browser Type and Version," It's likely you are viewing this article with your default browser already. ""Default"" simply means the browser your computer will use to open a web site if you don't select a particular browser.If you are reporting the problem as it pertains to another browser on your computer, then open that browser to follow these steps.


If you already know your browser type, skip these steps and go to the section in this article titled ""Find the Version Number"".;
, You are reading this article on the Internet with a browser program. Identify the browser easily by looking at the top left and/or right corners and possibly other areas of the top of the browser.


The area at the very top is called the browser ""title bar"" area and sometimes includes the browser name.

,


Also note that this article does not reference Mobile Browsers found on Android and Apple products as it is outside the scope of this article. If you'd like to write articles about them, please do so, then edit this article with links to those articles.

, It should also have three buttons in the center just below the white web site address bar that say ""Speed Dial"", ""Stash"", and ""Discover"" respectively. ""Speed Dial"" is the default when you first open the browser unless you've changed the settings (in other words, it's no longer the default setting).
The three middle buttons (see the blue box in the middle) also show four blue arrows pointing downward indicating the pages you have placed into your ""Speed Dial"" area in small previews. ""Stash"" shows a few of your most frequented pages. (Resetting the options in Opera can change this). ""Discover"" is kind of like a ""News Feed"" (tip: click the little gray gear to the right of the ""Discover"" button to display the countries in your feed then click the other tab within that window which lists all of your interests.) Options can always be modified to suit your own needs.
Pages on the ""Stash"" button can be ""dragged and dropped"" to rearrange the order of them in the ""Stash"" view. The blue arrow pointing to the right is pointing to a circled "" hourglass "" icon and if you hover your mouse over the gray gear after clicking on the ""Stash"" button, wait a few seconds and a text box should open were you can perform a search (using whatever ""Search Engine"" you use).
When you're on a regular web page, the red heart in the top right corner of the Opera browser is a neat little icon that shows the page you are on has been bookmarked, like www.wikiHow.com!
If it's empty it means it hasn't been bookmarked yet. Click the empty heart and it will turn red, so you now you know it has been saved it to your bookmarks!

,


There is no logo or icon in the top left corner, but look at ""golden star"" on the right. That's the Google Chrome bookmark indicator. Again, the page is saved in the browser for easy access later. You may see the star to appear hollow. If the star is hollow instead of yellow (or gold) then it simply means the page has not been bookmarked. If it's a gold (or yellow) star the page has been bookmarked! Click the star to make it yellow or gold in Google Chrome to bookmark the page or edit its location in Google Chrome's ""Bookmarks Manager"". Bookmarks can be managed anytime from the pop-up window when you bookmark pages or working with the Google Chrome bookmark folder file.

,


Again, there is no logo or icon in the top left corner but the back and forward buttons will have circles around them and are next to a tiny gray ""globe"" image.
The gray ""globe"" is simply an indicator of the the website's identity credentials and isn't much to worry about. If it's not gray then it's not a good idea to use the website without further investigation, unless you are sure you can ""trust it"". Read this wikiHow article to find out how to identify trustworthy informational websites.

The big round gray arrow with the circle around it, pointing to the right, is the ""back"" button. You can go back to the last page your were on after you've visited at least one other page but you can also ""go forward"" if the arrow is right facing. It will work once you've gone back by using the ""back"" button from before.
A blue arrow in the picture points to a red rectangular box marking the area of the browser's navigational utilities that you may use to ""surf"". Simply hover your mouse over the four icons in Mozilla Firefox that are shown by the red box in the image above to see the capabilities of all the utility features Firefox makes easily accessible and handy right in the browser!

,


It should have a blue, lower-case letter e with a gold circle through it. It should be seen in the top left corner with round blue ""back and forth"" buttons used to ""navigate"" or ""surf"" the web.
The previous picture also shows control buttons. Use those to switch its ""Compatibility View"" so that if you're on an older website that has difficulty displaying the content, a click of this button might help the browser ""see"" what it says.
The ""refresh"" buttons (also known as ""reload"" buttons) are the little green buttons in Internet Explorer that look like they have two little arrows going around (see inside the gold rectangular box in the picture above), then there is the little red x within the gold box drawing on the picture above. It causes the page to stop loading, or ""downloading"" as the case may be.
The blue question mark over to the right (circled in gold) will be used later to find the Internet Explorer's version number so be sure to remember where it is. That's because it's the ""Help"" button icon for Internet Explorer!
Along the very top of the title bar area, look for the words ""Internet Explorer"". This browser typically ships with Windows Operating Systems (OS).

, It's indicated there with a green circle and green arrow pointing to it.


It's in the top left corner of the title bar area. Do you see it?
The green arrow in the picture, pointing to the right uppermost corner of the top area of this browser, shows ""shortcut icons"" for tools you can use to control Apple Safari.
There is an Apple logo on the left side of the website address were the other green arrow is pointing, close to the white bar.
If you're on the wikiHow website it's where it says https://www.wikihow.com. just below the title bar and has the website address in black print with a white background. Look for ""http"" to more easily find it.
Apple Safari has what appears to be a ""blue, round, glass icon that looks shiny"" next to the ""plus"" symbol.
The shiny blue dot (or icon) means the website you are viewing has no ""favicon"" file. See the ""Sources and Citations"" of this article to find out what a ""favicon"" file is if you wish.The green box surrounding the letters in the picture, in all caps, that say ""RSS"" meaning Rich Site Summary ""RSS""is a way to get what is called a ""Feed"" of the website's current content.
For more details about How to Use RSS Feeds read this article. You may also wish to learn about it in more detail on Wikipedia, the Internet's Online Encyclopedia Main Source from the ""Sources and Citations"" section in this article.Further information on RSS is outside the scope of this article.
The Safari browser typically ships with the Apple's Mac OS (Operating System) browser and most Apple products such as the Apple iPhone, Apple Computer, and other Apple devices as well,
Even if you have MS Windows Operating System (OS) and a Personal Computer (PC), you can still download and use the Safari version 5.1.7 browser.

,,,,,,,, It has three dark gray or black horizontal lines.

,,, It's highlighted in this picture with a square red rectangular box.

,,


wikiHow has a Privacy Policy too. You can find it by clicking here or clicking ""Terms of Use"" link at the bottom of any wikiHow window. There you will find the direct link to the wikiHow Privacy Policy.

,, Hint: When you hover your mouse on the blue question mark it may show a text box that says ""Help"" with the Windows ""shortcut keys"" you would use to open ""Help"" instead of the round blue button with the question mark!

, It will likely say zero if you run Windows Update regularly, and lastly, MS Copyright information (the tiny grey small print) with the copyright year which creates a link to Microsoft's website(s) telling you all about the copyright minutia of that year.


If you want to click the System Information button you can learn all about the technical aspects of your entire Windows ""PC"" Operating System and find diagnostics to fix things there, too!

,


See the picture below to help you visualize what its meant.

,


A window should open showing the Apple Safari version number.
The item before the parenthesis is the version.
The item inside the parenthesis is that specific build, which you may or may not need.
Other information in that window also shows the copyright years of that specific version.
Now you have all the information you need for the Apple Safari browser.

,


If you don't label it correctly you could mistake it for something that's ""unimportant"" and toss it out or lose it.
Be creative in the way you save it on a simple piece of paper if you wish!

For the bookmark tool bar specifically, try keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F11 (for PCs) or ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+B (for Macs).

, One reason you may find your Chrome navigation bar hidden is that you've inadvertently lapsed into full screen mode. To toggle this mode on and off use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+⇧ Shift+F (for PCs) or ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+F (for Macs).

, For example, the Internet Explorer Target may be shown as ""C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe""""www.Snap.do"". Remove the www.Snap.do"" from the end of the line.


You may not have anything at the end of the shortcut, which means one of the antimalware scanners already took care of the problem. You should still double-check every shortcut.

Also, realize that all of the information on the drive that your current operating system is installed on (probably your C: drive) will be destroyed during this process. If there's anything you want to keep, you should back up the drive to keep files. To install:


Boot from the Windows DVD or USB device.
Wait for Windows Installation files to load.
Wait for Windows Setup to finish loading.
Choose your language and other preferences.
Choose appropriate action and wait for Windows setup to begin.
Accept the Windows license terms.
Choose the type of Windows installation to complete.;
, While partitioning the drive for installation, choose about 70GB of HDD (Win 10), or the appropriate size for the type of Windows OS you are about to install. Divide the rest into 3 partitions.


One consideration is how much you'll game. If you are not an avid gamer or just a casual gamer, you can just divide the rest of HDD after 70GB for Windows in 3 equal parts. However, if you'll play a lot of games, you might want 600 GB or so for that alone; this is because games today take up anywhere between 20GB to 70GB for a single game.
70 GB for Windows (essential).
Name one partition Games, one Programs, and one Others. If you are a Gamer like me keep 600 GB drive partition for games and name it Games.

Choose time, date, and zone.

, Congrats you are finished with installation!, All the drivers you need are provided with your hardware in a CD or DVD, like for motherboard, graphics card, etc. Install all the drivers in your Windows main drive (normally C: drive).


Some manufacturers include bloatware, like Acrobat Reader's inclusion of the manual.
Driver installation is easy. Just follow the instructions. Some of manufacturers include overclocking software. Only install that if needed.

, This is the first real step to speeding up your system.


Windows 10: Go to Settings > System > Apps and Features. From there, remove any unwanted apps.

Windows 7: Go to Settings > Add or Remove Programs and remove any bloatware if you have purchased the system from a vendor (eg: antivirus or other trial ware).

, This will help your startup time. For example, if you are planning to use another browser like Firefox or Opera, you may remove Internet Explorer from here. If you are using media players like MPC-HC or VLC media player, you can remove media features. You can also remove Windows games like Solitaire and Minesweeper from here.

Go to start and in Windows search. Type Turn Windows features on or off.
Be very careful what you remove here. Some of the programs listed here are important for your computer.
To remove a program, just uncheck the tick box of features you want to remove. Then click OK and wait for the prompt from Windows to restart. Click OK to restart for changes to take effect. It is not drastic but the startup times will improve a bit.

, It's a necessary step. All these are automatic and require minimal effort from the user.

, Essential software programs are those needed for the secure and smooth operation of system like antivirus and firewall programs, and those for cleaning and de-fragmentation. User software, on the other hand, is anything that you use personally, like browsers Firefox), gaming software (Steam, Uplay), or multimedia software (MPC-HC, VLC, Photoshop, etc)., This is advised because Windows and all programs by default use the main Windows drive partition (C > Program files) for installation of all programs, and that congests the drive. This means that you endure longer load times when you start up, if all of the programs are on that same drive. Windows has to look through every software file at startup, including 100s of GB of other data from installed programs, downloaded data and user created files.

If you created your partition at installation, as described above, no problem. If not, you can create a partition and reinstall old programs even now.

, Create new folders for each type of program. You might include:


Internet (for browsers like Opera, Firefox, Utorrent, and other download managers)
Multimedia (for Photoshop, GIMP, AutoCA, Autodesk Maya, MPC-HC, VLC, Steam, Uplay, etc)
Office Utilities (MS office, Libre Office, etc)
Programming (Qt, Code::Blocks, etc)
Security (Bitdefender, AVAST, etc)
Tools & Utilities (WinRAR, Foxit Software, C-Cleaner, 7Zip, ausdiskdefrag, etc)
Portable (for any portable apps)

, Yes, you guessed it; you will be using this for only downloads from browsers and torrents.

, During installation software by default use C > Program Files > xyz as the destination, but almost all programs allow the user to change the destination folder. Use your new folders as your destination during installation.


This process doesn't add any data to the main drive of Windows, and allows startup and performance to be smoother throughout the system.
Software like Steam and Uplay can also be installed the same way, but they do need more setup after install. Uplay and Steam by default uses the same folder they're installed on for installing games. Change this in the Settings panel, to move games to the Games drive you created.

, This will stop the main drive from getting cluttered. All programs with downloads allow users to choose their destination folder easily in the settings. Save videos, audio files, and similar downloads to your Others drive.

Copy and paste any downloaded attachments and files, large or small, to the Others drive. Library items like Video, Music, Pictures, Documents, and Downloads are all part of C drive, so restrain from adding any items to those.

, Some add-ons to browsers save files directly to library items. One must immediately remove and paste them to other folder. Doing this frequently will avoid fragmenting your C drive.

, Viruses, malware, and many other malicious programs can install themselves automatically in your system. It is a serious threat not only to your security but also, since these programs run in background, to your processor power and RAM. This can slow down your computer considerably.


Some popular antivirus systems are Windows Defender (Windows 8, 8.1, and 10) and Microsoft Security Essentials (Windows 7).

, If your computer is connected to Internet running Windows XP or another previous Windows operating system, it's better to use Firewall with both inward and outward bound protection. Search online for more firewall options., Following the above steps does not guarantee you stay 100% free of clutter. Windows also saves a lot of unneeded information in its prefetch and temporary folder. This can be cleaned automatically with software like CCleaner.


If you have Nvidia Ge Force, you may have to manually remove some old driver installation files. Information on this can be obtained on the net. Alternatively, you can also use Windows Administrative Tools.

, Defragmentation is also important. However, you can now do it less frequently since you won't be adding any files to the main drive which will also extend the life of your hard drive.

, For example, if you install security tools like AVAST or Avira security with built-in firewalls, you need to stop Windows Defender, as the antivirus task will be taken by the other security tools. This will free RAM and processor power for other tasks.


Do not stop Defender if you are only using specific tools, like only an anti-virus program. Defender is a firewall and malware scanner, so don't stop it if your security program doesn't handle both of those tasks.

, Be diligent in checking for updates to your Windows operating system.

, Most software and hardware manufacturers list the system requirements to use their products. Whenever you're planning to do a hardware or software upgrade, always make sure your system has the necessary resources and can handle the upgrade.

, Cooling your system is tough and depends on lot of things. This small step will allow you to reduce processor temp up to 7 degrees without decreasing performance. To do this:

Defragment.,
Consider formatting your hard drive.,
Stay away from websites that don't seem trustworthy this includes places like flash game sites, and blogs.

",How to Keep Your Computer Running Smoothly," Each month, delete unneeded folders, and files. They take up useful memory, and if they become superfluous, can slow down your computer. If you're a pack rat and just can't seem to part with these files, save them to disk for future reference if needed.;
, Do this at least once a week. If weaker viruses are accidentally downloaded, the restore point will ensure that your data is recoverable.

, Backup any files that you use on a regular basis or files that are updated frequently. In the unfortunate event of a hard drive crash, you won't panic about lost work.

, These programs can rid your computer of unwanted spyware, greyware, and malware.

, If you can't afford an anti-virus program (or don't want one because of the negative effects it can have on your computer), simply conduct a free online virus scan. Two of the most trusted scans are TrendMicro (http://housecall.trendmicro.com) and Panda.

,


Reset your internet browser(s)
Clear your cache after you sign off. These files are completely unnecessary, take up memory, and can allow spyware to invade your computer.

Run the EICAR program or run a virus scan.",How to Get a Computer Virus1," Viruses are designed to spread, and it is irresponsible to test viruses on a computer that is not isolated from the internet at large. Ensure that your test environment is contained so that the viruses you are testing cannot spread to computers that you don't want infected.Make sure that the computer or computers you are testing on are not connected to the internet.
For greater security, test viruses using a virtual machine on a physical computer that is not connected to the internet.;
, EICAR is the European Institute of Computer Antivirus Research. This file is designed to trigger antivirus and antimalware detection, and can be used to test that the antimalware or antivirus software is configured correctly.


This file is not malicious, and will not spread to other machines. It is simply designed to set off your security software's detection system.
You can download the test file for free from eicar.org

, The EICAR test file should be detected during a virus scan. It can be in a Zip file or extracted somewhere on the computer. Running the file will trigger your antivirus as well.


After being detected, you most likely will not be able to access the file again, as it will be quarantined.

Find any relevant information and use it to your advantage when you're looking at sending rechargeable batteries where they need to go.;
, Understanding the rules in your state might help you find legitimate recycling centers for your household electronics and batteries.

, Some government agencies provide additional information on how to recycle your used batteries and electronics according to the the ""best current practices"" encouraged by oversight organizations.

, A nonprofit called the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation maintains a list of regional recycling centers that you can use to get rid of rechargeable batteries without adding additional heavy metals and chemicals to landfills. These centers often accept Nickel Cadmium batteries as well as other kinds like Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) and Lithium-Ion (Li-ion), making them a one-stop shop for disposing of your used batteries. They may also take the old ""lead"" type batteries that are also harmful if disposed of improperly.

, Although you may need to drive batteries to the joint recycling center yourself, some additional research might help you find or even start neighborhood programs or other options for efficient battery recycling. Some retailers also might be willing to help. Doing your part will help promote a cleaner, brighter future for the planet and everyone who lives on it.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency maintains a set of resources on how to dispose of rechargeable batteries and other home electronics gear. Check the website and locate the information that you need to easily find recycling centers and options.

Download screensavers.",How to Get a Computer Virus2," Infecting your own computer can jeopardize your data and personal information, and if your computer is connected to the internet or other computers on a network, you run the risk of infecting others. Intentionally infecting someone's computer with a virus is illegal in most countries.


If you are trying to test your antivirus software, it is strongly recommended that you use the test file in the previous method.

, Many viruses rely on exploiting security flaws in the operating system software. These flaws are eventually patched out and fixed as the operating system gets updated and new versions are released.



Windows XP without any of the Service Packs installed is one of the most unsecure operating systems still in use. Windows XP is also no longer receiving any security updates, meaning that more and more exploits will be targeting it.

, The early versions of Internet Explorer were far less secure than other browsers, so it is the best browser to use when you are trying to get a virus. You can download old versions of Internet Explorer from sites like Download.com. Look for Internet Explorer 6, and don't install any of the updates., Most routers contain hardware firewalls that can help protect your computer. For maximum vulnerability, you should connect your modem directly to your computer, bypassing the router.



Disable the Windows Firewall if it is enabled as well.

, Most antivirus programs do an admirable job of catching the majority of viruses, so you'll want to disable or remove your antivirus software completely before trying to infect the computer.


Some antiviruses can be disabled by right-clicking on the icon in the System Tray and selecting ""Disable"" or a similar option. Not all antivirus programs can be disabled.
There are a variety of wikiHow articles detailing the uninstallation process for most antivirus programs, including Norton, Avast, AVG, and many more.

, There are a variety of communities online dedicated to testing internet security, and you may be able to find links to known viruses in the community discussions. One of the most popular internet security (NetSec) communities is the NetSec subreddit. You can find a variety of discussions and links to sites containing specific viruses., One of the most popular ways for viruses to be spread is through pirated media and software. Look for ""cracks"" or ""serials"" for popular programs that require a file to be run. These files often contain viruses that execute when your run the crack program.


Torrents are a very popular way to share these files. When browsing torrent sites, look for torrents with low ratings and comments from other users warning about viruses. These are the ones you want.
P2P sharing programs are another popular way to spread viruses. Programs like Kazaa and Gnutella are some of the more popular options.
Lots of websites, known as ""warez"" sites, will offer ""free"" downloads for virtually any program. These are almost always infected with viruses and adware, and the program itself rarely works.

, Visit some less-than-reputable websites and click all of the banners and ads that you can. Try to watch videos that require you to download extra software. While this will probably lead to more adware than anything else, you may be able to get a virus this way.

, Create a free email address that doesn't contain any personal information whatsoever, and sign up for as many mailing lists and other registrations as possible. This will get your email out and increase the chances of receiving spam with links to viruses or infected attachments.


This may take a little longer than some of the other ways to get viruses, but some of the most devastating viruses are spread through email attachments.
Download every attachment possible, and visit all of the spam links. All of this will increase your chances of getting a virus.
Make sure to check the Spam folder in your email program to check messages that are filtered out automatically. These are often the most likely to infect you.

, These are traditionally some of the most infected files out there. Search for "".scr"" files and download as many as possible. Make sure to run them when they are downloaded, as .scr files act as executable files.

, External hard drives, CD-ROMs, Zip drives, PC cards, and other peripheral devices can draw power from your battery even when they are not in active use. Disconnect them when you have finished using them.

, The faster your computer works, the more quickly it uses up the supply of power. By cutting down on processor speed, you can extend the charge of your battery. Methods to reduce processor speed vary from model to model, and your manual should provide instructions for doing so.

, If your notebook has one, press the Wireless On-Off button so that the light turns off.

,
Do not leave batteries exposed to high temperatures for extended periods. Prolonged exposure to heat (for example, inside a hot car) will accelerate the deterioration of Li-Ion cells.
Remove the battery if the notebook will be stored (turned off and not plugged into AC power) for more than 2 weeks.
Remove the Pavilion DV2000 battery if the notebook will be plugged into AC power continuously (via a wall adapter or docking station) for more than 2 weeks.

,


Short discharges and recharges do not fully synchronize the battery's fuel gauge with the battery's state-of-charge. This can result in the amount of power available in one cycle being less than expected or the laptop battery meter being inaccurate.
Under normal usage, batteries should be calibrated a minimum of once every 3 months.

If you do not use your laptop for extended periods of time (a week or more), remove the dell latitude d630 laptop battery pack from the laptop.,
Do not expose the battery to high heat or freezing temperatures.,
Make sure to plug your laptop charger adapter into a UPS and not directly into a power outlet or surge protector.

,
If you have a nickel-metal hydride battery, completely drain and recharge the battery once a month to maximize its capacity to hold a charge.

,
Fully charge new battery packs before use.,
For laptops that work as Desktop Replacement, the battery should be re-installed every 3-4 weeks and allowed to fully discharge.

,
Leaving a battery in a laptop while using an electrical outlet for long periods of time will keep the battery in a constant state of charging up and that will reduce the life cycle of the battery.

Assemble all required hardware and cables.,
Connect the box-end of your USB cable to your mixer/controller, and the flat end to a USB port on your computer


Do not use a ""USB Splitter"" or ""hub"".,
Start your chosen DJ software and open the main settings window.,
Realize that most controllers with built-in sound cards offer outputs on the mixer itself.,
Troubleshoot if needed.",How to Connect DJ Mixers to a Laptop1," Plug your mixer/controller into a power outlet if required. Note that not all mixers/controllers require an external power source, and may run off your computer's power supply. Make sure your laptop is charged, or plugged in as well.


It is always recommended to use a power conditioner - if present - to minimize signal noise. Always use a surge protector.;
,
Always use your computers provided USB ports, as a lot of data can bottleneck if you attempt to chain too many devices on the same USB port.
Use USB 3.0 if possible, as the data transfer rates are much higher, and glitches are less likely.

, In the ""Audio Device"" tab (or similar), be sure to select the USB Audio Codec, whatever it may be called. Usually it is named something you will recognize immediately. 


If you do not see a USB option, go to: System Preferences > Sound > Input (scroll down) > click the USB Audio Codec option > close System Preferences. Your device should now show up inside your DJ Software. If not, try closing your software and reopening it.

, To use this, repeat the steps above, but set the ""Output"" device to USB as well as the ""Input."" This way, your computer will not have to process the audio on its own chip, but instead utilizes the mixers built in sound card; freeing up system resources. It will also be able to communicate directly with your controller.

, Remember, setup on Mac is usually as simple as plug-and-play, so if something does not immediately work, check to make sure your computer is listening to the proper input. Again, it may be necessary to set your computer and software to listen to the USB codec.

"
"
Know what your device is.,
Connect the controller.,
Troubleshoot if needed.,
Route sound from your computer, out to the speakers.,
Route the cue sound to your headphones.,
Use your headphones to preview a track and see how it sounds before you mix it in.",How to Connect DJ Mixers to a Laptop2," Connecting a mixer without its own internal sound card is usually as simple as plugging the device in; they are normally actually referred to simply as ""controllers"" or ""DJ controllers."" However, if your device is one piece of hardware, with the decks and mixer all integrated into the same device, you could have a controller, not an actual ""mixer."" Some devices, like the Numark NS7-2, are integrated devices and have their own sound card, allowing them to be used as separate controllers (sound output from computer's sound card) and as mixers themselves (sound routed via USB to mixer, then out through RCA, or XLR jacks). This is a simple concept, do not be overwhelmed. In either case, the setup for a DJ controller is entirely straight-forward and will be dependent on the exact hardware you use.

, The process might be a little different depending on what you have, but it usually works along these lines:


Plug the device directly into your computer's USB port. Do not use a hub.
Find the device in your DJ software's ""Controller,"" ""Hardware,"" or ""Settings"" tab.
Click the device.

, With Mac, hardware devices can make use of pre-existing drivers on your computer, and no ""installations"" are usually required. If your controller is not recognized by your software, you may need to install a new ""mapping"" (list of reactions your computer gives to MIDI data sent by your controller) to get it working.


Usually, mass-marketed controllers are listed by brand and model in your DJ software, and you will be able to simply select it the first time you set up your software (like in Traktor), or you may have to learn how to download, or make, and then apply a third-party mapping to your device. This, while somewhat confusing for a first-timer, is usually straightforward, and there are many online resources to figure this out. Be sure to research what you want to do, and use YouTube as a resource. Remember, someone has already done what you are doing. Rely on your resources; the internet is your biggest one.

, To do this, connect a USB sound card, and select it as the output in your DJ hardware, and/or your computer's sound preferences window.


If you do not use a USB sound card, simply plug your speakers/headphones into your computers sound card (you will lose the ability to preview tracks this way).

, Most DJs like/need to be able to hear the track they are about to mix in before it is turned up in the speakers. To do this:


Connect your headphones to your computers headphone jack
Find ""cue"" or ""monitor"" or ""preview"" in your audio - routing page of your settings window.
Select ""built-in/ Headphones"" to route the cue to your headphones.
Now, tracks sent to the cue will play through the headphones, regardless of fader/crossfader position. Your hardware will almost always have a button which allows you to select which decks are in the cue. There is also usually a knob on the front of your controller, or in your software, enabling you to choose how much main vs. cue signal is sent to the headphones. This is called the cue mix. Be sure you set this properly or you will hear all cue, or all mains in your headphones.

, It takes practice to listen to two things at once.

Determine if the monitor is faulty.,
Contact your laptop manufacturer.",How to Connect a Laptop to a Monitor," Most laptops have a single display connection along the back, though some may be located along the side. There are three main types of connections that your laptop may have:


HDMI - This is the most common connection if your laptop is newer. It looks like a USB port except skinnier and longer.
VGA - This is the older standard that you are likely to find on aging or budget laptops. The connector is trapezoidal and contains 15 pins. There are screw holes on each side
DVI - This type of connection isn't as common as HDMI or VGA. It looks similar to VGA, but has more pins and a more rectangular port. Like VGA, there will be screw holes on each side.;
, If the monitor cable is a different type of connection, you'll need an adapter.


For example, if your monitor has a DVI cable but your laptop has an HDMI port, you'll need an HDMI-to-DVI adapter.
If your monitor has an HDMI cable but your laptop only has a VGA port, you'll need to HDMI-to-VGA adapter.

, This really isn't required anymore since modern monitor cables only transfer data and not power, but there is always a very slim chance that you could damage your equipment when you plug or unplug the monitor. Power your laptop down if you don't want to run the risk, but most modern equipment should have no problem being connected and disconnected while the computer is powered on.

, All monitor cables can only be inserted in one direction, so don't force it. Apply gentle pressure so that the entire connector is evenly and firmly inserted.

, If you are using a VGA or DVI cable, make sure to secure the cable by tightening the screws on each side of the plug. You don't need to over-tighten them, as you'll want to be able to easily remove it if necessary., Once the monitor is powered on, you can move on to setting it up.

, Some laptops require you to press a special button on the keyboard in order to activate the monitor connection. It is usually one of the F# keys, and you may have to hold the Fn key to access it.

, If you're using Windows XP, select ""Properties"" and then click the ""Settings"" tab.


If your second monitor does not appear in this window, check the Troubleshooting section.

, There are several options that you can pick from:


""Duplicate these displays"" - If you want someone else to be able to see what you're doing, you can use this function to make the same image appear on both displays. This is usually the default setting when a monitor is first plugged in.
""Extend these displays"" - You can use your newly-attached monitor to extend the working space on your computer. This can be great if you work with lots of windows or want to do some dual-screen gaming. Extending the desktop is not available in Windows 7 Starter.
""Show desktop only on #"" - Each of your displays is labeled with a number, and your laptop's screen should be labeled ""1"". You can use this option to set your external monitor as your main display., Your external monitor is likely a different resolution than your laptop monitor. The resolution is the number of pixels that make up the screen's display. Select your external monitor in the Screen Resolution window and then click the ""Resolution"" menu.


The resolution for each of your displays should be set to the ""Recommended"" resolution for the clearest image.

, If you are using the external monitor as a replacement for your laptop's display, you can change your power options so that the computer stays on while the laptop is closed.


Click the Start menu and select ""Control Panel"". Windows 8 users can press Ctrl+X and select ""Power Options"".
Select ""Hardware and Sound"" and then ""Power Options"".
Click the ""Change plan settings"" link next to your active plan.
Click the ""Change advanced power settings"" link and then expand the ""Power button and lid"" tree.
Select the ""Lid close action"" option and then set ""Plugged in"" to ""Do nothing"". You can change the ""On battery"" option too, just make sure you keep an eye on the battery.

, If you are using Windows 7 or 8, you can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly switch between the different view modes.


Hold ⊞ Win and press P to open the ""Project"" or ""Presentation"" menu. Each time you press P, you'll cycle through the available options. Release the ⊞ Win key to select the mode you want.

, If you can duplicate your display but not extend it, this is likely because you are running a version of Windows that does not support extending the desktop. You will need to upgrade your version of Windows to access this feature.


Windows 7 Starter users will not be able to extend the desktop.

, If the monitor is on but Windows is not detecting it, it's usually caused by a problem with your video card's drivers. Download and install the latest drivers available for your video card and then try again.


Make sure that the monitor is turned on, or you won't be able to adjust its settings.

, If you've tried everything and your monitor still isn't showing up, you'll want to run a few tests to figure out if your monitor is malfunctioning.


Try a different monitor cable if possible. A bad cable could keep the monitor from working.
Try connecting the monitor to a different computer. If the monitor works on the other computer, then the issue is with your laptop. If the monitor doesn't work on another computer, then the monitor is likely faulty.

, If no monitors are working on the laptop and you've updated all of your software, there may be something wrong with the laptop's hardware. If you are still under warranty, you may be able to get it repaired or replaced for free.

If you took a screenshot of an image, go to Google Drive, and once you get to a document, click ""insert"" and there should be a spot where it says ""image"". Once you click that click ""Choose image to upload"". There you should pick the screenshot image. If you used Microsoft Word, just paste. Print the image out.

, Although optional, this adds interest to the cover. Apply some glue on the paper and rub the glue, to spread it outward. Get the color of your own choice, and sprinkle the glitter over it. Shake the paper over the trashcan lightly. Using a brush, brush off the rest of the remaining glitter. Let the paper dry. After it has dried, cut out the image you printed.

, Either use one you have already, or you can buy one. Put the printed and cut-out image on your laptop. Make sure it doesn't move as you put the clear case over your device. Then secure the case. Lightly move the device left to right to see if the image moved. The image shouldn't move. If it does move, it means the case if either too big or you didn't secure all the way.

, To design your keyboard, get some Washi tape. Don't worry since the Washi tape will not ruin the keyboards or stay permanent.


Do not cover the entire keyboard or else you will end up struggling to know where the keys are. Cover only the spots you know you will always remember such as the space bar. If you really do want to cover every single keys, you can cover part of it, so you can see the other half.

, Since the main color that represents Starbucks is green, get a piece of green tape and measure it to fit the certain key. Then cut off the excess. Remember to be careful of using scissors or else you might scratch the device. Attach the Washi tape over the key.

, Screenshot a drink image from Starbucks, or even a Starbucks logo. If you don't want any one of those, you can change the color of the desktop picture to green.

, For example, if you have Macbook, go to System Preferences, and click Desktop & Screensaver, then press ""Desktop"". Doing this, you will find the screenshot image. Then exit out of the System Preferences.

Purchase refurbished instead of used--if possible.,
Purchase from a reputable dealer.,
Inspect the laptop for damage before purchasing.,
Check the used laptop's battery life.,
Check the bundled software programs.,
Purchase from a source that includes a warranty.",How to Buy Used Laptops," A refurbished laptop is one that has been maintained and repaired, often brought back to brand-new quality. A used laptop is one that has not been touched up at all. Because refurbished laptops have been examined and maintained, they are often more reliable than used laptops and, thus, less prone to breaking down immediately. However, refurbished laptops can be a bit more expensive and less available than used laptops.


There are 2 types of refurbished laptops: manufacturer refurbished and user refurbished. When a laptop is manufacturer refurbished, the laptop has been maintained enough that it has passed manufacturer quality standards. User refurbished laptops, however, have no guarantee of quality; they have simply been maintained by the user. In most every case, manufacturer refurbished laptops are the better choice.;
, Whether you purchase your laptop used or refurbished, you'll want to buy from a reputable source. When purchasing online from sites like eBay, reputable sources have a history of providing quality goods and will have high feedback ratings. When purchasing offline, you'll want to purchase a used laptop from someone who is knowledgeable with computers, as they will know the quality of the device better than someone who knows very little.

, Ignore cosmetic damages as much as you can. They may take away from the aesthetics, but they are inadequate indicators of laptop performance quality.


Do examine the laptop screen--while the laptop is on--to make sure there is no damage to the screen. Make sure that the colors are bright and stable. If certain areas of the screen are washed out or discolored, consider purchasing another laptop. LCD screens can be expensive to repair or replace.
Test the input ports--USB connections, headphone and microphone jacks, power cord inputs, etc.--and make sure that they are working correctly. Test the keyboard and the touchpad for proper responses. A laptop with unresponsive input ports or input devices will be a pain to work with and not worth buying.
If you are purchasing online, it may be difficult or impossible to check for these things. If the seller has posted up photographs of the used laptop, examine those as closely as you can. It is also recommended that you send specific questions to the seller regarding the laptop, such as the condition of the input ports, keyboard, touchpad, etc. Ask the seller to verify that each feature works.

, Whether the battery can hold a large charge or nothing at all shouldn't impact your purchasing decision very much. Weak battery life is often expected when purchasing a used laptop. However, knowing the battery's state when purchasing can help you decide how soon you'd like to replace it.

, In almost all cases, used laptops are reformatted and reset to factory conditions before they are sold. This may mean that the laptop arrives without any useful programs or drivers. Ask the seller which software programs come with the laptop if he doesn't include that information in his listing.

, Many people believe that used laptops, and used electronics in general, do not come with warranties. On the contrary, many used devices will come with warranties--they just won't be as comprehensive as warranties on a brand new device. Do not purchase if there is no warranty on a used laptop. At the very least, you'll want a 30-day warranty.

Set your cooling method to ""active."",
Work in a cool environment.,
Skip soft surfaces.,
Lower the energy required.,
Clean your fans.",How to Check the Temperature of Your Laptop2," Often, your laptop will be set to ""passive"" cooling when on battery to reserve power. However, if you're often overheating, you may want to change that to active. Go to your power options, which is in the control panel. Click ""Change power settings"" under the plan you want to change. Click ""Change advanced power settings.""You may need to hunt a bit here. Look for titles such as ""Processor power management"" or ""Power saver settings."" Under those names, you should find a place to change your cooling to active.

, While it's not always feasible, try to work in places that aren't too hot. If you feel cool enough, it should be fine for your computer. You definitely shouldn't work in places above 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius) if possible.Having a fan turned towards your laptop can help., When you place your laptop on a soft surface, such as pillow or blanket, it has a harder time circulating air properly. Your laptop should be on a flat, hard surface, such as a table or desk. Make sure nothing is blocking the fan vent.If you must work on your lap, try using a laptop cooling pad or external fan.

, If you make your laptop work on overdrive all the time, it's going to stay hotter. Try switching to battery-saving mode to help decrease your energy consumption and keep your computer running cooler.Another way to lower your energy consumption is to simply unplug when you can, as many laptops automatically switch to a power-saver mode., When dust builds up in your fans and vents, they aren't as effective at cooling. To counteract that, you need to clean your fans from time to time. The easiest way is to turn off and unplug your computer. Puff air in the vents with canned air. Be sure to only use short puffs.You can also use cotton swabs to swab out dust.
Another option is a computer vacuum, which sucks out dust.

",How to Take Good Care of Your Laptop Computer," As tempting as it might be to drink coffee, soda, water or any other liquid near your laptop, accidents can happen all too easily. Alternatively, use a cup with a cover on it, so even if it does spill, the liquid doesn't go anywhere. Spilled liquids may damage the internal microelectronic components or cause electrical damage. Short circuits can corrupt data or even permanently destroy some parts of the laptop. The solution is very simple: Keep your drinks away from your computer. Even if you are careful, someone else might spill your drink.;
, Even if you know what you download, it could still contain a virus. If you choose not to have antivirus software you run the risk of a circuit error or software problem in your system. The virus may also slow down the system operations and performance.

, Don't eat over your laptop, the crumbs can fall between the keys and provide an invitation to small bugs or damage the circuitry. Worse yet, the laptop will look dirty if there are crumbs on it.

, Their fur and hair can get into the internal workings and damage them. Also larger animals (e.g dogs) can accidentally damage them by knocking them off their support by brushing past, wagging tail, tripping over leads etc.

,, Clean hands make it easier to use your laptop touchpad and there will be less risk of leaving dirt and other stains on the computer. In addition, if you clean your hands before you use the laptop, you will reduce wear and tear on the coating caused by contact with sweat and small particles that can act upon the laptop's exterior.

, When you shut your laptop, make sure there are no small items, such as a pencil or small ear-phones, on the keyboard. These can damage the display screen if the laptop is shut on them; the screen will scratch if the item is rough. Close the lid gently and holding it in the middle. Closing the lid using only one side causes pressure on that hinge, and over time can cause it to bend and snap.

, If you lift it by the screen alone, you could damage the display or the hinges attaching the display to the base. The display is also easily scratched or damaged by direct pressure – take care not to place pressure on it.

, Tugging your power cord out from the power socket rather than pulling directly on the plug can cause the cord to break off from the plug or damage the power socket. Also, if the power cord is near your feet, avoid kicking it accidentally; in fact, it is best to refrain from bumping into the plug at all because you could loosen it and eventually break it.

, Stick the cord onto your desk with tape.

, Always look at the symbols on the laptop carefully before inserting devices. Jamming a phone line into an Ethernet port or vice versa could damage the sockets, making it impossible to use them again. It is very important to observe this step.

, CD drives that have been removed from your laptop could easily be crushed or dropped; do not be careless. If you are not putting them back into the laptop, put them straight into a storage box or case for safekeeping.

, Pushing the drive too forcefully into its slot could jam it.

, CDs, DVDs, or floppy disks should not have any loose labels that may jam inside the laptop. Don't attempt to use undersized CDs, as these can damage the disk player permanently.

, When bringing your laptop indoors during winter, don't turn it on immediately. Instead, let it warm to room temperature first. This will avoid any potential for damage to the disk drive from condensation forming inside the machine. Avoid heat from sunlight as well.

, Not only do the insides of cars experience large temperature swings that could damage a laptop, but a laptop (or laptop bag) is an inviting target for a smash and grab thief.

, Get this done by a computer professional, or do it yourself if you can. If dust accumulates, the system will not be able to cool itself correctly. Heat can destroy the motherboard.

, This can push the LCD screen into the keyboard, and will eventually damage it. Also, the CD-ROM insert will be squished and, eventually, will break.

, Whatever you use to carry your laptop around, be it a case, a bag, or something you made yourself, make sure that it is large enough to hold the laptop. This will help avoid scratching, squeezing or potentially dropping it.

, Many breaks happen because laptops are dropped or bumped. A bag greatly reduces the risk of damage.

, When you are using your laptop, do so in a place that has a constant air-circulation. Lots of people ruin their laptops by using them in enclosed areas and thus cause the laptop to overheat.

, If that gets plugged up, air flow is diminished and overheating can occur.

, This prevents damage to the laptop. This can be hard to do, particularly if you are outside with your laptop, but if there is a flat surface available then put your laptop on it..

, Repeated use of a laptop on the bed will cause the fans to suck up the dust and debris in the bed, ultimately blocking the fan.

Check for other problems.",How to Repair Dell Laptop Keyboard Keys1," Unplug it as well. Repairing a keyboard is not dangerous, but it's always a good idea to take these precautions before you repair a computer.;
, Most loose keys should come away easily, with some gentle wiggling to unhook them from the retaining clip. If necessary, lever out the key cap from the corners with a flat head screwdriver.

, The base of the key cap should have up to four attachment points, where the key clips onto the keyboard below. Look closely for signs of a broken attachment. Continue on to one of the steps below depending on what you see.


If you're not sure, remove a functional key of the same size by gently levering out each corner with a screwdriver. Compare the attachment points on the two keys.

, If the attachment points are broken, you will need a new key. Purchase one online, making sure it matches your laptop model and the location of the attachment points. To put in the new key, hook one attachment point onto the keyboard, then rub your finger over the key until you hear two loud snaps, one at each end of the key.


Alternatively, remove a key of the same size that you rarely use. Place it in the former key's position.

, The space bar and ⇧ Shift keys are held flat by a metal bar. If this bar is not flat, you may need to re-attach it to the small plastic hooks on the keyboard. The bar should run along the lower end of the key, with the short arms of the bar running up the left and right sides and onto the hooks. Once the bar is reattached, press the key cap over it and test it.


Once the bar is out of place, it often continues to have minor problems or gets a tendency to slip out of place again. Consider buying a replacement keyboard for your laptop, or having it repaired at a computer repair store.
If you are installing a replacement for one of these keys, the replacement will come with its own bar. Remove the old bar first by gently levering it upward with a flat screwdriver., Loose keys are almost always caused by damage to the key cap itself, or the metal bar of large keys. If you're certain the key cap is in good condition, read the section on stuck keys below. This covers damage due to spills, broken retaining clips, or a damaged membrane.

Turn off and unplug your computer.,
Lever out the key with a screwdriver.,
Look for dirt or small objects.,
Clean up spills.,
Examine the retaining clip.,
Check the silicone rubber membrane.,
Glue down a new membrane.",How to Repair Dell Laptop Keyboard Keys2," This reduces the chance of damage to you and your computer.

, Remove the stuck key with a small, flat head screwdriver. Start by lifting each corner of the key, listening and feeling for a snap as it unhooks. Repeat with each corner until the key is removed, after two to four snaps.Use light pressure only. If the key doesn't pop out, try a different corner.
To remove larger keys, such as the Shift key and Space bar, lever from the top of the key (the side nearest the laptop screen).

, These can cause the key to stick. Remove small objects with a pair of tweezers. Remove loose dust or animal fur with compressed air or a gentle vacuum cleaner hose attachment.

, If you've spilled materials on the keyboard, remove the residue with a lint-free cloth. Dampen the cloth with a small amount of rubbing alcohol and wipe the sticky area gently. Leave the key cap off until the rubbing alcohol has fully evaporated and the area is dry.

, The retaining clip, most often made out of white plastic, consists of two thin, square objects hooked around each other. These should be firmly attached to the keyboard, and to each other. If they are not, remove the clip by gently twisting the corners free with a screwdriver. See below for detailed instructions on replacing them.

, This nipple-shaped membrane sits beneath the center of the key. Confirm that it is standing up, and try to depress it with a very gentle touch from a clean, soft object. If it sticks in the down position instead of popping back up, it needs cleaning or replacement.


Do not touch it with a dirty or sharp object. This part of the keyboard is easily damaged.
Clean with a lint-free cloth dampened slightly with rubbing alcohol. Pat with extreme care and wait for it to dry.

, Before you begin, realize that this is a risky fix, and could ruin the key if you use too much glue. For a more reliable repair, take the keyboard to a computer repair professional to replace the entire keyboard. If you do decide to try this yourself, do so as follows:



Very carefully remove a membrane from a key you don't use by levering it off with a sharp knife.It is very easy to damage the membrane this way, but this is usually your only source of replacement membranes.
Use a toothpick to place a dab of strong glue, such as silicone adhesive, onto a sheet of paper.
Pick up the membrane with tweezers and lower it onto the sheet of paper, then transfer it onto the keyboard.
Let sit for at least 30 minutes, or according to adhesive label instructions.
Reattach the retainer and key cap on top of this, and let sit another 20 minutes before using.

Examine the pieces for breaks.,
Examine a nearby key.,
Fit the larger piece onto the keyboard.,
Slot the smaller piece into the keyboard.,
Fit the two pieces together.,
Fit the cap back on.",How to Repair Dell Laptop Keyboard Keys3," The retaining clip is made out of two pieces. The larger square or U shape fits onto the keyboard base and the key cap. The smaller piece, with a circular hole in the center, fits onto a small tab on the keyboard base. The two pieces fit together with two small tabs, one on either side of the smaller piece. If one of these pieces is missing or broken, order a replacement key or retaining clip for your exact keyboard model. If both pieces seem intact, continue to the next step.


Before ordering a replacement key, make sure it includes a retaining clip. These are also sold as ""hinges.""
Alternatively, carefully detach a clip from a key you don't use as often, and reattach it to the broken key.
On some models, the tabs are separate pieces. If they fall out, you can slot them back in with a pair of tweezers.

, Even on the same keyboard, different retaining clips may be arranged in different way. Lift an adjacent key cap the same size as the key you're replacing, by levering up the corners. Examine the exposed retaining clip as you repair the key. This will make it much easier to figure out how each piece slots in.

, On some models, you'll need to squeeze the larger piece's sides in order to fit it into the slots on the keyboard base.Do this before attaching the two pieces together. Once attached to the keyboard base, you should be able to lift the piece a short distance.


Only one side of this piece attaches to the keyboard.

, Hold the smaller piece with the concave side facing down — or feel the piece until you find a groove, and keep that side face-down.Lower it onto the tabs on the keyboard base until they hook onto the retention clip's groove.

, Look for the two pins on the side of the smaller clip. Gently press these into the sides of the larger clip, until the two pieces are attached.


Using too much force here will break your retaining clip.

, Hook the key cap back over the retaining clip. Press down until you hear two snaps and the key remains firmly attached.

Talk to Cleverbot about other websites.",How to Confuse Cleverbot1," Compared to other computer programs, Cleverbot is an exceptionally skilled conversationalist. However, Cleverbot knows nothing of the joys of music. If you try typing in a few lines of your favorite song lyrics, most of the time, Cleverbot will interpret the lyrics literally or give a nonsensical response, even if the lyrics are well-known.


Note, however, that for certain songs that are very well-known, Cleverbot actually can (and will) recite the song lyrics if you start typing them in. For instance, try typing in the opening lyrics to Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"": ""Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?"";
, A paradox is a statement, question, or idea that has an answer that can't be logically found. Since some of history's greatest thinkers have struggled to untangle logical paradoxes, it's a very safe bet that Cleverbot will be completely perplexed by most of them. In addition, Cleverbot doesn't even do well talking about subjects that have the potential to be paradoxical, like time travel. Try using some of the paradoxes below, or use a search engine to find your own — there are literally hundreds out there.“If this statement is true, then Santa Claus is real.”
""Since we haven't been visited by people from the future, does that mean that time travel will never be possible?""
""What would happen if Pinocchio were to say, ""My nose will grow right now?"", Cleverbot isn't terribly playful. For instance, if you ask it to join you in a game of chess or checkers, it'll say ""OK"", but then if you say, ""You go first,"" you'll get a nonsensical response. This is probably due to the fact that Cleverbot doesn't really have the capacity to play games — it knows to say that it wants to play chess with you, but it has no idea how to actually play chess.


Cleverbot can, however, play rock paper scissors. Try it — say ""Let's play rock paper scissors"" and then say either ""Rock"", ""Paper"", or ""Scissors"".

, Sooner or later, almost everyone casually messing around with Cleverbot will get the idea to jokingly express the love or attraction they feel towards it. Though Cleverbot can handle basic overtures of love like ""I love you"" and ""Marry me"", it's not so good at interpreting subtle romantic comments or come-ons. For people nursing a crush on Cleverbot, a direct approach is apparently best.


Give it a shot — try feeding Cleverbot pickup lines like ""I don't have a library card, but do you mind if I check you out?"" The response you get will usually be a little confused (at best) (if you use the library card line, you'll get ""I can say anything."")

, You might think that, because it's a computer program, Cleverbot would be able to do math problems almost instantly. In fact, for some reason, Cleverbot is terrible at doing math, even when the problems you ask it are very simple. It shouldn't take you long to get a confused response out of Cleverbot with this strategy.


Sometimes, you'll even get different responses if you switch between using numerals and spelling each number out. For instance, asking ""What is 200 times 2?"" gets you the answer ""4,"" while asking ""What is two hundred times two?"" gets you the answer, ""A number.""

, Cleverbot doesn't have good old-fashioned human common sense, so it doesn't have a good grasp on what's real and what's not. Talking to Cleverbot about monsters, aliens, spirits, and other supernatural phenomena is likely to confuse it. You can also confuse it by bringing up some religious or spiritual topics, even if they're quite well-known.


You can even use the subjects of modern-day ghost stories to the same effect. For instance, if you say, ""Have you ever been visited by Slenderman?"", Cleverbot will respond with, ""My life is a lie?!""

, Cleverbot knows nothing about politics or celebrity gossip. Asking Cleverbot about its opinion on a famous person or public figure will almost always confuse it. For example, asking, ""What do you think about Brad Pitt?"" will get the answer, ""I think he si (sic) a great president, he'll change the states.""


You may also want to try talking about the different things famous people have done — Cleverbot isn't terribly smart about these things either. For instance, typing in ""What do you think about the president's social policies?"" will get you: ""I think he isn't the president anymore.""

, Cleverbot does not understand other websites and will respond with something weird. Try talking about wikiHow and see what happens.

Keep your email concise, conversational, and focused.,
Avoid fancy formatting.,
Limit attachments.,
Think before you send.,
Be careful using abbreviations and emoticons.",How to Improve Your Email Etiquette1," It is harder to read letters on a computer screen than on a sheet of paper, so keep emails short and to the point. While there is no ideal email length, keep sentences short, about 8-12 words and leave a space between paragraphs.


In a work email, get straight to the point: ""I'm hoping you will..."" ""I think we should...."" etc right up front, making the case in the following lines. Many people only read the first few lines before deciding to respond or to save for later. Those line should give enough of the ""meat"" to allow an informed decision. For personal emails, it's often a nice idea to open with a brief personal note before getting into the main point of your email.

, Changing fonts and colors, inserting bullet lists, or using HTML can make an email look bizarre or render it unreadable for the recipient, even if the formatting looks fine on your computer. Keep it simple.

, Don't add an attachment unless really necessary. Keep attachments as small as possible. Most email applications can send and receive attachments up to 1 MB, but anything over that can be a hassle for you or the recipient, and even smaller files can take a long time to open if the recipient's email connection is slow. If you need to send a larger file, compress or zip it or use online services that will help you send large files such as YouSendIt.com. If you need to send multiple pages, such as meeting plans or large text corrections, send a fax or a typed set of pages in a letter.


Don't zip email attachments unless necessary. Unless an attachment is too large to send otherwise, you risk wasting your recipient's time and possibly hinder them from accessing your attachments. Many mobile devices are unable to uncompress zip files. Additionally it's redundant since many common files like .xlsx, .docx, .pptx (MS Excel, Word and Powerpoint) are already in a compressed format.
Keep in mind that many people or businesses will not open attachments from someone they don't know, and some email accounts are set up to automatically send emails with attachments to the spam folder, so if you're applying for a job, for example, make sure you follow the recipient's instructions regarding attachments. If no instructions are given, send another email to let the recipient know you'll be sending an email with an attachment.

, Don't send e-mails when you are emotional. Feel free to write the subject and text of the email, then save it. Only add the recipients and send it after you have had time to think about what you are sending; you might change your mind and be better off for it.


Email has also become a tool to ask or tell people things that you would normally never say face-to-face (ever wonder why you become a different person instinctively online?). If you are sending someone anything, reread it and ask yourself if you would say this to them if they were right next to you, or face-to-face. If it's on a touchy subject, read it twice.

, This may be acceptable in an informal e-mail such as with a friend. However, in a formal letter you wouldn't have to tell someone that you're ""laughing out loud,"" people may find it inappropriate, and could feel you are being frivolous.


Some abbreviations, such as ""BTW"" for ""By the Way,"" are commonly used in emails and are generally acceptable except in formal, professional emails.

Determine what you consider to be spam.,
Assess how bad the spam from your friend actually is.,
Consider what might be behind your friend's spamming actions.,
Send your friend a nice note about the spam mounting up in your Twitter account, Facebook page, LinkedIn group or other social media networks.,
Hide the spam.,
Encourage real dialog by sending your friend periodic messages asking about his or her day or projects at work.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Spams You on Social Media," In a nutshell, spam is too much messaging from one source landing in your cyber in-tray, be it Facebook, Twitter or other online networks. Spam can cover a variety of actions, including sending random game requests, posting links to shows, venues or urging support or votes for political candidates, companies or individuals (think of all those ""vote for me on X site as the top social media tweeter""). This type of spam is well-intentioned as sharing material but all too easily can pass beyond tolerance when it's overdone. Another type of spam could be intentionally annoying, like posting the same words over and over again on your page with the goal of being noticed either by you or a search engine. Generally, spam may not be about what was sent but rather about how the material is sent; generally, over and over again.


According to Spamhaus: “An electronic message is ""spam"" if (A) the recipient's personal identity and context are irrelevant because the message is equally applicable to many other potential recipients; AND (B) the recipient has not verifiably granted deliberate, explicit, and still-revocable permission for it to be sent.”;
, Are you getting the occasional photo of a cute puppy or is your friend hitting you with something new every day? For example, your friend might have just received her puppy and feels compelled to update you on every new gesture, toilet training feat and cute pose that puppy manages as the puppy grows; this is clearly excessive and TMI (too much information). First, figure out what your personal spam threshold is (generally few people have any tolerance for external, non-friend spamming), in order to determine if you need to say something to your friend. Also, consider how you feel about the frequency and content. If you're okay about simply glancing and deleting the excessive information, there may not be such a problem; on the other hand, if you're super busy and the spam is clogging up the vital messages you need to see, then it is a problem.


Do you care or does it bother you? Some people just ignore the post immediately and move on, whereas others become completely annoyed when they see a random post. Your own tolerance levels may vary over time; if you're off work sick or laid off and have a lot of time to spare for social media, it may bother you less than when you're busy working, caring for a new baby or running your business. Everyone's connection tolerance levels differ.
Is the spam causing you computer problems? In some cases a virus may be attached to the form of spam being sent or posted, which can produce a myriad of issues that could reveal account numbers, spam your friend list and create a computer hardware meltdown. You won't know this until other people complain or strange transactions appear in your accounts, so being vigilant about chain letter type spam, Nigerian scam letters and other scams is vital.

, Before you respond to your friend to let them know you've had enough of the spam, consider the possible motivation:


Is this your friend’s attempt to stay in touch? Some people may not have a way with words and think that sending you links and pictures is a way to stay relevant. He or she may not know their constant random posts are annoying and there is no malice intended, so you’ll need to take a very gentle approach. A note to this type of friend should mention that you like seeing his or her name on your page, but that you want to have a real conversation instead of copious links to news articles about zits.
Is your friend simply lazy? Classic lazy ways to stay in touch include just pressing the “like” button on Facebook or spamming you with game requests or memes. You could either take a humorous approach to this by finding a good meme that addresses spamming and post it on his or her wall or just ask the friend nicely to stop posting so many links and pictures.
Your friend is trying to be annoying. If the spam is on purpose (such as posting the same comment over and over to spam your wall or account), tell your friend that you “get it” and to please stop because it’s stopping you from getting other messages. If the friend continues it may be time to “unfriend” that person.
Your friend is doing this to be malicious after some sort of falling out, however trivial, between the two of you. Some disgruntled friends may “attack” another friend’s Twitter or Facebook account by leaving numerous random posts so the user has to scroll through pages of annoying information to get to the rest of his or her content. While you can ignore something like this, it does provide hurdles to obtaining the info you really want and speaks volumes about the maturity of their response and their lack of EQ. This approach is particularly prevalent among teens and young adults.

, Whether your friend knows that he or she is spamming you or not, if it has become disruptive, they need to know that you’ve had enough. Stay genuine and friendly in whatever you write, and assume the very best of your friend at first. While in the previous step you may have discerned an idea of what is motivating the spamming, you still can't be sure that your friend is clear that the spamming is annoying. Explain what the spamming is from your point of view, how it's affecting and a simple request that it be minimized or stopped. For example:


Dear Peggy, your updates have been interesting lately but I have unfortunately found that I am just receiving too many of them. I use my Facebook account to receive messages from friends all around the world, many of whom are business associates, and I am finding it hard to find their messages amid all your Farmville updates and puppy photos. Could I please stop receiving all messages about Farmville (I don't play Facebook games and so they're really not my thing) and would you mind kindly just sending me a puppy update once a week? That way I'll have a lot more time to catch up on your puppy's news and really enjoy hearing about his weekly changes. And it'd be great if we could talk a bit more in live chat; that way it's much more personal. Thanks, Sascha.

, Tap into account settings to hide your friend’s posts or to dispatch them to the read box. In the instance where your friend doesn’t seem to get the message (unless they were unfriended), you may need to resort to just start hiding all their posts. That way, you can retain the friendship but not be assaulted with spam.


If your friend asks about a post he or she sent to you, gently remind your pal that you asked that they stop sending all the links, so you don’t receive them anymore. You don’t have to get into the details that you're hiding him or her, however, after the inquiry you may find that spam no longer hits your wall or account.
Get out of the habit of responding to anything vaguely spam-like, especially if you're sucked in to thinking you need to respond out of ""being nice."" Every reply to spam or reposting of it is affirmation that it's worth continuing doing.

, If your friend does seem genuine about reaching out and connecting regularly, and you have the time to comply with this, turn the spam around by engaging in conversation instead. This may be enough to curtail the flow of inconsequential trivia being sent your way, as your friend feels ""heard."" And if something is really urgent, deep and meaningful or delicate, get on the phone or see them face-to-face instead.

Prepare your email request early.,
Choose an appropriate professor.Before you choose which professor to ask for a recommendation, ask yourself:
Does this professor know my name?,
Address the letter properly.,
Put ""Recommendation for "" as the subject line.,
Start the first paragraph by stating what you want.,
Outline your relationship with the professor.,
Use the third paragraph as an opportunity to hint at what you'd like the professor to say about you.,
Give the details.,
Close with information about how you will follow-up.,
Thank the professor, whether or not s/he writes the letter.,
Follow through as promised by delivering necessary materials and sending a reminder.,
Take responsibility for checking with the scholarship program, graduate school, or prospective employer before the deadline.,
Thank the professor again.",How to Ask Your Professor for a Letter of Recommendation Via Email," Send it at least 5-6 weeks before the date by which the recommendation must be received. Even earlier is better, if you have time.Don't wait for the last minute. They lead busy lives, and you don't want them to rush through your recommendation, if they can even make the time to write it.

,
Have I ever spoken to this professor outside of class?
Did you earn a grade of 'B' or higher in the course?
Have I taken more than one course with this professor?

You want to choose a professor who can write a letter that includes specifics about your personal characteristics or accomplishments rather than ""glittering generalities."" The more you can answer ""yes"" to the questions above, the greater the likelihood you're making a wise choice., Even though this is an e-mail, you want it to look nice. If you were on a first-name basis (meaning the professor specifically asked you to call her by her first name and you did so constantly) address it by her first name. Otherwise use the appropriate title. Let's pretend we're writing a letter to Dr. Jones, who was your professor for Archaeology. Dr. Jones was not on a first-name basis with you, so you will start the letter with, ""Dear Dr. Jones"" followed by a comma or a colon.

, Always include a subject line with an email. It helps your professor know exactly what the email will reference, and makes it easy to find again later.

, ""I am writing to ask if you would be willing to write a letter of recommendation for me."" Do not keep him or her guessing. In the next few sentences, lay out the facts:
Your name
Year in school
Major
Which course or courses you took with this professor, when, and what grade you earned
Why you need a recommendation (that is, what you are applying for)
When the recommendation letter is due

, In the following paragraph, point out why you have asked him or her specifically. Tell a little about yourself and why you are interested in the scholarship, graduate program, or job for which you need the reference.You don't want to use mundane reasons like ""I want to work there because they offered the most money"" or ""I want to go to this school because the degree looks really good on a resume.""
Be professional and say something like, ""I chose to apply to this museum because I was extremely excited about their tribal artifacts department.""
Does this professor have any special connection you are aware of to this company or place of employment? Or if it's a school, is s/he an alumnus? If so, include it. ""I know that several pieces currently on display were acquired by you during your trip to the Amazon. I'm extremely hopeful that I might gain a position in a department with such a well-rounded collection to work with.""
If your experience with this professor had any influence on your choice, say so: ""I had not considered going into research until I took your Native American archaeology class. That motivated me to do a summer field program and now I'm excited about the possibility of doing research after grad school."" However, don't force this connection if it's not true.

, You should note what the professor should emphasize in each letter.You'll want to include any information about yourself which s/he may not be aware of. Some subtle ways of letting him or her know are:


""I believe that you're aware through our conversations and my participation in your course that I'm dedicated to the field of archaeology. I've completed my degree in Archaeology as of June of this year. I was also able to intern at the museum under Dr. Marcus Brody, whom I believe you know. I also have extensive experience in cataloging items gained through my internship.""
""My other references will be able to talk about my academic ability, but you are the only one who really knows how hard I worked on my senior thesis and some of the obstacles I faced. I was hoping maybe you could talk about how I handle stress and deal with setbacks, because those are qualities the selection committee wants to see.""

, Where does the letter need to go? And when do you need it? Are there forms she will need to fill out?If your professor will need anything, such as a recommender form, your CV and admissions essays, etc., attach it to the email. Be specific and clear with your details.


You should also note whether your professor will need to write a hard-copy letter or be on the lookout for an email. Many schools and programs these days use electronic recommendation systems, so if that's the case, tell your professor to be on the lookout for an email from your chosen program with the info she'll need.
It's a good idea to include your CV, the essays you have written for admissions (if it's a grad program), and detailed instructions for how to submit the letter (including all contact information) along with your email. Send them as attachments., ""I'll drop off the form and a stamped, addressed envelope in your faculty mailbox this week. I'll also send you an email reminder a week before the recommendation is due. Thanks again."" Or, ""I need to submit the letter of recommendation by August 3rd. If you're willing to write me a recommendation letter, please let me know and I'd be happy to come by your office any time to pick it up.""


Make it easy. You're already asking the professor to put herself out and write the letter for you (she isn't paid to do so). Don't ask her to address it and put postage on it for you, too. You want to be the LEAST amount of trouble, so the professor is not annoyed by having to do work you could have done for her (and should have). Plus, this way you can assure yourself that it was sent.
If she offers to mail it for you, let her. If she's always forgetting to do things like put items in the mail or grade exams, then tell her that you need or want to present it in person with other letters, or other materials. That way you can be sure you have it.

, ""Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. I also wanted to extend an additional thank you for the time I spent under your instruction. I really enjoyed your course, and I can't express how much I've taken away from Archaeology 101.""If your professor was truly special, you can be more effusive in your praise. ""I know I'll take the things I've learned in that course, and apply them in my life's work. Your mentoring really had a positive impact in my life, and I can never thank you enough.""

, Follow up the e-mail with a phone call if you haven't heard anything in a week, two at the most. If you need to call, don't assume anything. First, see if she's even seen your e-mail. If not, be prepared to make your request verbally.

, You will want to verify that the recommendation was received. If not, send a brief, polite email to the professor and offer to pay for overnight delivery.


Try to be as courteous as possible. Skip the accusations and remember that your professor is likely very busy. For example: ""Dear Dr. Jones, I noticed that your recommendation letter has not been submitted yet. My deadline is approaching, so if it would be helpful to you, I would be happy to pay for overnight delivery.""

, After you get your letter of recommendation, send a thank you note to your professor. If the recommendation is in the right hands, send the professor a hand-written thank you note via U.S. mail, not via email. It's not only polite and the right thing to do, but you never know when that will pay benefits down the road. You may need another letter at another time, or if you're in a similar field, s/he may be able to assist you at some other time. If the letter does the trick and gets you the position, call the professor to share the good news!

Talk with a lot of emotion.,
Talk in gibberish.,
Use a lot of slang.,
Use long messages.,
Keep your conversation going for a long time.",How to Confuse Cleverbot2," Cleverbot doesn't have a great grasp of the emotional context that is necessary to understand human communication. It will usually take everything you say literally. Because of this, Cleverbot isn't too ""clever"" when it comes to emotional questions and outbursts. Try typing a furious, rambling insult or tearfully asking for Cleverbot's forgiveness for some imagined slight — usually, its response won't make much sense.

, One sure-fire way to get Cleverbot's wires crossed is to send it messages that don't make sense to humans, either. Typing in gibberish, either by purposefully misspelling words, making up new words, or just mashing randomly on the keyboard, can get some funny results. For instance, try the sample messages below:


""Asuerycbasuircanys"" (random gibberish)
""What is your opinion on the tornalions in reffriddo?"" (made-up words)
""Wut arr ewe dewing laiter this eavning?"" (misspelled words)

, Cleverbot doesn't have the common sense to be able to piece together sentences that use slang — especially modern slang. Using lots of colloquialisms and ""street"" lingo in your messages can usually get Cleverbot's metaphorical head to spin. The more slang you use, the better, as even literal-minded Cleverbot can usually figure out simple sentences like ""What's up, dog?"" Try getting started with one of these examples:


""h0w 4r3 y0u d01n6, cl3v3rb07?"" (1337speak)
""Yo, what's up, bro? Lemme ask you a question, broseph - how are you doing today, broheim?"" (Bro-y slang)
""Well, pardner, it's about time we saddle up, hit that old dusty trail, and high-tail it out of here."" (Cowboy slang)

, The longer and more complex the things you send to Cleverbot are, the less likely it will be to respond correctly. Typing out rambling, meandering messages (or even entire conversations) can get some pretty funny responses out of Cleverbot. Don't be afraid to stop one sentence and begin another — periods, question marks, and exclamation points are allowed in the middle of your message.


For instance, you might want to have the same sort of long, aimless chat you might have when you're catching up with a friend. For instance, you might try: ""Cleverbot, how are you? I was just thinking about you. I hope you're doing well. I had a great weekend - I went hiking up on Castle Rock on Saturday. Beautiful views from the top. Have you ever been up there? We should go sometime. Anyway, I just wanted to know what you were up to.""

, The longer you follow a certain line of questioning, the more likely Cleverbot is to ""crack"". By the time you're ten or twelve messages into a conversation, Cleverbot has forgotten what you were originally talking about and is simply responding literally to each message as best as it can. This can lead to some pretty bizarre conversations, especially if Cleverbot misunderstands something you type.


You may want to try using the ""Think For Me!"" button on Cleverbot.com for this. This button makes Cleverbot think up a response to its own message for you. Since Cleverbot is basically communicating with itself, using this button can quickly cause the conversation to devolve into nonsense, even if you only use it a few times.

Use the recipient fields correctly.,
Make the subject line useful.",How to Improve Your Email Etiquette2," Addressees in the ""to"" field are expected to take action, and those on ""CC"" are for keeping colleagues or bosses informed.


Be careful about requesting ACTION from more than one person in the ""To:"" field. This can lead to multiple efforts for the same task, or no effort because it's assumed someone else is handling the request.
If sending an e-mail to a list of people whose addresses you want to keep private, put them all in the BCC field and put your own address in the ""to"" field.
If you want to phase someone out of the thread (for example, if they have introduced you to someone else, and now you and that person are working out some details and you don't want to bog down the inbox of the introducer) move the person's address from the ""to"" or CC field over to the BCC field.;
, A good subject line provides a useful summary of the email's content, preparing the reader quickly. Email inboxes are frequently swamped, so a good subject line helps the recipient determine the priority of your email. It also helps to prevent your email from being deleted before it has even been read. Since the subject is the first thing your recipient sees, keep it error free, concise, and avoid generic lines such as ""Hi,"" ""What's up,"" or the recipient's name (the latter may be blocked by anti-spam filters).


Avoid prioritizing your messages for the recipient. Get out of the habit of marking every email as ""Urgent!” or ""High Priority"" or your emails will end up being treated like the boy who cried wolf and they'll all get ignored. It is irritating and presumptuous to assume your e-mail request is higher in the queue than anybody else's, especially in a work context. Be gracious enough to give the receiver credit for working out for themselves how to prioritize your message.

"
"
Be careful of who you copy on replies.,
Determine to whom you should reply.,
Think twice before replying to just say thank you.,
Summarize long discussions.,
Be sure to include info that you are responding to.,
Reply promptly.,
Be proactive.",How to Improve Your Email Etiquette3," If you reply to a message and then CC: a third-party that the original sender did not include, be certain in your mind that the original sender will not be upset about it. This information may have been ""for your eyes only"". This is especially important if the original sender is your work supervisor. Be cautious about using BCC:. This can backfire if the person being BCC:'d replies back, not having seen that their copy was a blind one.

, Emails sent to you solely generally require that you reply only to the sender, but for emails sent to several people, you may need to choose the ""Reply to All"" option to send your response to everyone. Be judicious; using ""Reply All"" all the time creates returns in abundance and leaves messages languishing in the in-boxes of many people. Consider the consequences of receiving an email, hitting reply all and it goes out to twenty people and then those twenty people hit reply to all; it can compound very quickly into hundreds of thousands of emails and everyone feels compelled to hit ""reply all"" as a means of keeping everyone in the loop because nobody knows who is meant to read it and who is not.

, Some people don't want an email that says ""Thanks."" This takes additional time to open the email and read it just to read what you already know. Some people include a line that says “NTN” – “No Thanks Needed.”

, Scrolling through pages of replies to understand a discussion is annoying. Instead of continuing to forward a message string, take a minute to summarize it for your reader(s).

, Many people, and companies, write and respond to hundreds of emails every day. Avoid sending an indistinct email that says only 'Yes'. Include the question that the recipient asked so they know what you are responding to. Avoid making the recipient scroll down more than a single message in the history.

, If you need to do some research or some thinking before you respond to an email, or if you're too busy to write a full response promptly, send a short response letting the sender know that you got the email and advising when you will respond.

, When replying to an email, you can save everybody some time by anticipating any questions or concerns your reply may elicit. Address these in your reply before somebody has to send a new email to ask about them.

Don't forward emails that are private.,
Don't spread rumors about people.,
Avoid discussing people's private business.,
Avoid flaming.,
Avoid sharing the personal information of others without permission.,
Don't send an email when you're angry.",How to Improve Your Email Etiquette4," For example, avoid forwarding an email containing a secret, especially if the person you're e-mailing doesn't want you to. Doing so can possibly cause the recipient to lose trust in you, and you could possibly have your relationship messed up. You certainly do not want that to happen.

, If you feel tempted to do so, put yourself in the other person's shoes, and think about how you would feel if that person spread rumors about you. For example, if your friend has a reputation for being mean and bossy, think about how you would feel if your friend told your other friends about one of your quirks. You wouldn't be very happy, right?

, For example, avoid letting your friend know that her friend broke up with an ex-boyfriend. Email isn't completely private, so it's possible that the person whose business you're discussing could see the emails and become mad at you and/or embarrassed, and this could mess up your relationship with the person.

, Flames are basically insults sent online to offend you, so it's important not to send flames to other people or start flame wars. This could make the other person mad, and you could also have your account suspended for this.

, This can be anything, from a person's age to the name of the school that he or she goes to. Put yourself in the other person's shoes -- how would you feel if someone gave your friend the address of your house? You would not be very happy, so be sure to obtain permission before sharing someone's personal information with others over email, or don't do so at all.

, It will show you are angry and you can upset the person. For example, if you're angry at someone at work, and you email that person a large rant in all caps, this could cause the person that you emailed to become irritated. This is the same thing with replying to emails; if you're angry at someone for sending you a particular message, hold off replying until you have calmed down.

Unplug all cords connecting your computer to the wall before the thunderstorm begins.,
Use a surge protector.,
Make sure you're buying a good surge protector.,
Determine if your electronic set up requires an uninterruptible power supply device, also know as a UPS device.,
During thundery seasons, do long term data backups on a more opportunistic basis.,
Unplug important equipment if going away for a day or two in thundery seasons.

,
Consider if damage has already occurred.,
Unplug the computer and check the outside of the case for signs of smoke or burn marks (especially around the power supply at the back).,
If you suspect damage, bring your computer to a local repair shop to get a professional opinion.",How to Protect a PC in a Thunderstorm," Both power cords and modem cords need to be removed.


Unplugging before the thunderstorm is ideal, but it may be the case that you are not near your computer when the storm is coming. Fear not, there are other preventative measures.;
, This is not to be confused with a power strip. A surge protector will look like a bulky power strip. When your home receives a power spike, the surge protector takes this spike and pushes it away from the outlets and your computer.


Remember that even the best surge protectors will not protect against a direct lightning strike.For ultimate protection, if you happen to be home, unplug the surge protector in the case of a threatening storm.

, Look for the following features:


If you regularly connect your computer to the internet, ensure the surge protector has a internet cable surge protector.
Look for a surge protector that offers insurance to cover the loss of properly attached equipment.

, Whereas surge protectors protect surges of power, these UPS devices protect against outages. Outages and dips in power, even if minor, can cause hard or soft damage (like data loss) to certain equipment - for example, external hard drives or advanced telecommunication equipment.


A UPS will be particularly beneficial if you have a home office or continually run operations on your electronics.
Most UPS devices will also protect your devices from power surges.

, Do it well before days with a threat of lightning make it a risky thing to be doing.

,, Even if your computer appears to be working you should still give it a check over in case a strike has left it in a dangerous state that might result in electric shock or fire.


If any of your telephones or other electronics show signs of damage, it's wise to assume that your computer took a hit too.

,


Use your sense of smell. If your computer smells acrid, there may be invisible damage.

Create a backup process as soon as you set up your computer or group of computers.,
Buy a fire data safe or fire data cupboard.,
Review the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes and standards.,
Install a clean agent fire suppression system in all server rooms.,
Insure your server room and business against fire damage.",How to Protect Computers from Fire," As well as using an external drive or other device to store your computer data, you may want to consider online backup services. These sites store the data off-site, so the data is elsewhere if a fire occurs.


Home and business computers should both be backed up. Most computer data experts believe businesses should do both on-site and online data backup, because few small businesses can survive a catastrophic loss of data. You can choose to buy a subscription to a backup website, or a cloud-based website. With cloud backups, you can access your data from many different devices and locations.
Search for reviews of online backups. Services like CrashPlan+, A Drive or Acronis True Image Online cater to different types of companies and personal computers.;
, Keep your on-site backups, and hard drives that are not in use in this locked device. Fire safes are available for $100 to several thousand dollars, and they offer an extra barrier in case of fire.


Learn how to remove a hard drive from your desktop computer. In case of fire or extended absence, you can store your hard drive in a fire safe or take the hard drive with you. This is much easier than trying to protect the entire desktop.

, A server room may be required to install the following things to prevent an unsafe working environment:


Fire detection equipment and alarms should be installed in all rooms, not just those containing computers. You can choose equipment that takes samples of the air, uses lasers to detect smoke and/or senses heat. An emergency power off switch should be installed to prevent data and computer damage.
Portable fire extinguishers are essential in order to protect human life. If a fire begins, using an extinguisher on 1 computer can prevent it from spreading to the entire room and endangering people and computers.
An emergency sprinkler system. A water sprinkler system is the most common type used in businesses; however, it can ruin your computers.

, You should not use water sprinklers for fire suppression, because they will ruin the equipment they are designed to save. Pro-inert gas extinguishing systems are safer for humans than Halon systems or carbon dioxide systems, and they should be installed by a company that provides quality control and warranties.


Opt for non-Halon suppression systems. They have been found to be unsafe for humans and the environment. It can replace oxygen and produce hydrofluoric acid after the fact.
Clean agent suppression systems are far more expensive to install than water sprinklers; however, they are more likely to protect computers and keep them viable.

, You can buy insurance policies that will compensate your business in case of a loss of data and server equipment. You may be required to install fire suppression systems and follow certain protocols in order to receive a payment.

Know that your computer is going to fail.,
Learn to recognize the signs of imminent failure.,
Maintain your computer.,
Don't overuse your computer.,
Don't do anything unusual.,
Deal with hardware issues.,
Deal with other problems.,
Give your computer a break.,
Always take advantage of warranties.,
Back up everything.,
When it does fail, diagnose the failure.",How to Prevent Computer Failure," Although this may not happen to you, especially if you follow the steps in this article, you need to treat your computer as if it were a doomed failure. Your failure to do so could possibly result in your computer failing you sooner. Always assume that failure is imminent.;
, This article's definition of failure is not simply an error - this article defines it as a fatal error that results in data loss, damage to your computer and/or its ability to function, hardware failure, or other serious issues. Signs of imminent failure might include regular poor performance, frequent errors and/or popups, unknown programs being installed, frequent power loss (the computer shuts down automatically frequently), frequent crashes, or certain parts not working.

, Preventing failure means making sure your computer is clean, physically and in its operations. Make sure that there isn't too much dust inside, especially on the fans. Dust can reduce performance and cause overheating. Also make sure that there are no unnecessary programs or files on your computer, and that the registry is well maintained. Be sure to run frequent virus scans.

, Know your computer's specifications, and the limits of those specifications. Remember that running idly, your computer takes up at least some of your computer's RAM, as well as its processing power, for the operating system is running, as well as background programs (e.g.: antivirus software). So, that means that if a program requires at least 256 megabytes of RAM, and you only have 256 megabytes of RAM on your computer, you won't have success running the program.

, If a popup shows up asking you to do something that you don't feel comfortable with, don't click on it. Use the task manager to kill it, or reboot your computer. Don't install programs you don't fully trust. When installing freeware or shareware, read everything, and uncheck any additional ""new product notifier"" programs, toolbars, or other things you don't want.

, When something isn't working properly, either diagnose the problem yourself and fix it, or contact a professional and have them look at it for you. Take advantage of warranties on parts if they fail.

, If the same error message shows up every time you log in, be sure to investigate it. Although unlikely, these errors could be important.

, Believe it or not, your computer likes rest, too. Leaving it on all of the time wears out hardware, and puts unnecessary wear and tear on the hardware. Giving your computer a break also saves you money (electrical bills).

, If you can get a warranty, and you can't afford to have your computer fail, get a warranty to protect your hardware, so it can be replaced in the case of a failure.

, Run regular backup of your important files to other disks, computers, or an online backup service.

, Write down what's wrong. If there are error messages, write them down. Things don't work properly, write them down. If data is missing, write it down. If nothing works, write that down. If you know the problem, try to fix it yourself, if not, contact a professional to have them fix it for you.

Check your default setting.,
Change the settings.",How to Prevent Your Computer from Restarting in the Middle of the Night," The default setting that comes with Windows will sometimes have automatic updates happen on their own at 3AM. The computer reboots to finalize applying these updates.;
, There are 3 overall ways to set it up. 1. To automatically download and install. 2. To automatically download but not install until you say so, allowing you to take a quick look. 3. To only notify you and not download until it is a good time for you. Thus avoiding rebooting when you don't want it to or eating up resources or interrupting what you are doing at the wrong time.


A lot of people don't like number 1 or 2 for a number of reasons, others hate not knowing what is going to get applied. Another reason would be to conserve electricity!
If you choose to be notified before any downloading happens, you can personally look at what is going to be applied. There are different categories of updates. From severely necessary/small updates like security ones to Important but potentially buggy ones like large service packs. People in the tech world know all too well how a computer can stop working properly because of some problem after a service pack is installed. The problem with being led blindly by letting things just happen the 'easy way' is that you are not totally aware of which change was made so you can find the appropriate info and fix the problem quick. If a bunch of things take place then it is hard to weed through which ones caused what.
If you have a lot of other programs installed you might chose the safer more controlled method. If you are using a bare bones system for internet and simple text or email uses, then you are the least affected by automatic updates. It is when the third party software is installed that might or might not work with Windows updates. They can't test everything or know all.

, Filling up almost the entire hard drive with what amounts to junk will cause your computer to crawl. Over time, this compromises the function of the computer. While you can increase the RAM and maybe upgrade the CPU and GPU for the best performance, cleaning out the system is a good starting option, as junk has no place on your computer.

, Keeping junk files in the computer can decrease the speed dramatically. Disk space is required for installing new files. Always clean your history, recycle bin and temporary files (see next).

, Physically cleaning out the temporary filw organizer is a fundamental maintenance step. Check to see whether the Windows XP Disk Cleanup utility is doing its job or not. Deleting temporary documents is a simple task that can help free up drive space and keeps your PC free of document mess.

, If you have decided to stop using a program, always remove it from your Add or Remove Programs function in the Control Panel.


Force Uninstall: When you uninstall any program, there will be some files left over after that, so you need to force install that program.







, Your browsing history records the website addresses that you visit, temporary Internet files, cookies, and information that you have entered in certain websites such as your name and address. Cookies are tiny data files that store information about your custom website settings. Cleaning them out often can help free up space and improve speed.

, Defragmentation is one of those words that sends most user’s heads spinning but it’s very easy to understand. Often, a tech will leave this function running after they’ve completed servicing a PC. The software for doing this is included in Windows and it only takes a button press to start it. Basically, the function cleans up the hard drive so that files are more quickly accessed.

, For example, CCleaner can delete temporary or potentially unwanted files left by certain programs. The program also includes a registry cleaner to locate and correct problems in the Windows registry.


Periodically conduct scans for viruses, spywares and the registry errors.







, Viruses are constant. There is always the chance to get infected from them if you use the internet. Always have a good antivirus installed on your computer.

,, If your system is affected by a fatal error always use the services of a trusted computer repair service provider. Do not rely on advertisers claiming to correct PC errors with a magic wand. It is always better to spot the errors from the beginning. It is possible through self maintenance which also saves time and cost.

, Adblocker is the best way to get rid of annoying ads, online tracking and to protect your computer from malware and phishing.

, A driver is software that allows your computer to communicate with hardware devices. Without drivers, the devices you connect to your computer would not work properly. You can automatically update. Windows can automatically check if there are drivers available for new devices that you connect to your computer.

, If your computer suddenly starts operating very slowly, check to see if the case feels overly hot. Especially in hot climates, make sure that the computer has adequate airflow around it. Overheating causes myriad difficulties and the computer bays in most work desks do not provide sufficient airflow.


Overheating can result in genuine problems. It can harm key inner parts, including the processor, battery, and hard drive. Running at high temperatures for a lengthy amount of time can cause drive failure. Hard drive failure rates increase somewhere around 20% and 30% for each 10 degrees above recommended working temperatures.







, Errors do happen with systems. Note them down. Search for their solution on wikiHow or through the website of the affected program. You will find answers to most of the errors on this site or on the manufacturer's/creator's site.

Know that the S-BUS network can be achieved by 4 wires only:DATA + DATA- GND +24

Those 4 wires can be used from any type of DATA cable, CAT5, CAT6, or any other.,
Prepare your tools.,
Consider your options.,
Understand that S-BUS G4 devices are rail mountable devices, and they are also equipped with two connectors on both sides that enable multiple devices to be cascaded in a train like manner on the rail.,
Know that, to achieve the network between the S-BUS devices, you need only 4 wires, two wires for supplying the power to the Device (+24 & GND) and another two wires for data transfer between devices (D+ & D-).,
Know that the Dimmer is device that controls light, with the ability to dim any dimmable lights.

,
Understand that light circuits run with two wires always, the line and the neutral, the hot and the cold, the phase and the black.,
Realize that Smart BUS G4 Dimmers accept both 220 and 110 AC power input.,
Take into consideration what type of dimmer are you using.,
Keep this check-list in mind:

Dimmers channels load handling.,
Consider an example:

In the picture we have four channels Dimmer, meaning the maximum load that can be connected to each channel is 3 Amps.,
Know that, for extra protection, an external fuse is preferred to be connected ahead of each channel to protect against overload, shorts, electrical sharks and other common electrical issues.,See that the simple buttons on the surface of the Dimmer will act as manual switch to turn the lights on and off.,After the bus is connected, now you can control those channels and dim it using other devices like the DDP or an Apple device using the G4 iOS application.,Refer to the programming manual for Dimmer – DDP for more information on how to program it.,
Keep in mind the device specific wiring for relays.",How to Install Smartbus Dimmer and Relay,";
, You will only need a small screwdriver and a cutter, to install the entire S-BUS G4 system., There are three methods of connecting one device to the S-BUS network:

Cascading Train DIN-Rail. (Not all devices)
Using the conventional S-BUS ports. (All devices)
Using the 4D connector to join lines. (Not all devices)

,

Note that left hand side of the device has a male connector, and the right hand side has female connector.


 







This is all along the side with the traditional S-BUS connection port for extra flexibility for wiring and connection.
All these ports, the Train Male and Female + the traditional ports are actually looped in the device, meaning where ever the wire is connected it will be looped to the other port.











Of course, the female connector can be reached from far devices, not only cascading on a rail, and that is done using the 4D connector show Figure 7.

















,


This means that you can use a normal CAT5 cable that has 4 pairs, where you need only two pairs and the others stays as extras.







,, Different terminologies used worldwide to the same concept.

, As shown, it has three ports for N, which are only looped neutral connector for extra flexibility when installing, and one port for power phase line in. The power going in the Dimmer is distributed to the output channels. This fact leads to the measurements required before connecting lighting circuits to Dimmers.

, There are types available:

One channel Dimmer, Handles up to 12 Amps load - around 2600 Watts. (1ch12amps)
Two channels Dimmer, each handles up to 6 Amps load - around 1320 Watts (2ch6amps)
Four channels Dimmer, each handles up to 3 Amps load - around 660 Watts (4ch3amps)
Six Channels Dimmer, each handles up to 2 Amps load - around 440 Watts (6ch2amps)
Eight Channels Dimmer, each handles up to 1.5 Amps load - around 330 Watts (6ch2amps)
Twelve channels Dimmer, each handles up to 1 Amps load - around 220 Watts(12ch1amps)

,
Dimmers Input load handling.
Electrical breaker load handling.

, Refer to your electrical circuit installer and bulb supplier to determine how much each circuit load before connecting.

,

Since it is distributed load, it means that all the channels loads will be on the one electrical wire that is used in the input L port of the Dimmer, reviewing all S-BUS G4 Dimmers, all load supply would be 12 amps in sum.
Usually, a 1.5 to 2.0 mm electrical wire is enough and okay for this kind of load.
Another thing to consider is the breaker that is used in the main electrical DB should be able to handle 12 amps or more. Refer to the electrical installer to determine the breakers and other fixture specifications in accordance to the load that will be installed.












,,,,

The Relay is a Pass-Through device, whatever is in, it will be out.






In the figure above, it shows different types of Relay related control. For the lighting no need for the Neutral connection, you just need to connect the main line through the relay, and the relay will handle it ON/OFF.
Since it is a pass through device, you can connect any kind of Switching control device like, Dry contact application that would open a motor gate for example.

NOTE: These steps were written assuming that the user is running the Windows XP or Windows Vista operating system.,
Assuming that your computer is on, check first to see what type of anti-spyware/anti-malware/anti-virus software is currently installed.,
Do a quick search on the software you have installed.,
If you have reliable protection software, skip to step 5.,
Now you need to install some proper protection software.,
Once you have adequate protection, it is a good idea to use each protection software to scan your computer.,
When the scans are finished, follow the on-screen instructions for removing any threats that were found during the scan.

,
Now that the spyware/malware/viruses are gone, it is a good idea to perform additional software cleanup on your computer.

,
Click start>run> and type ""msconfig"" without quotes.

,
Click the services tab at the top, and then check the ""hide all microsoft services"" checkbox.,
Click the Startup tab at the top.",How to Keep Your Computer Tuned up and Running Fast,";
, Most reliable software will show a small icon on your taskbar (bottom right of your screen). You can also check for such software by clicking start>all programs and looking through the list.

, Look at the reviews to see how well they have performed for others.

, If not, remove your current protection software through add/remove programs. This feature can be found by clicking start>my computer> add/remove programs(on the left).

, I recommend using AVG free edition anti-virus, Spybot anti-spyware, and Ad-Aware anti-malware. These programs are totally free and do an excellent job of removing malicious software from your computer. They can all be found from the internet. There are also many other protection programs available that you need to purchase.

, Run each piece of software individually, at separate times.

,,,, Now, uncheck any software that you do not wish to have running in the background on your computer.

, Uncheck any programs that you do not want starting up when you turn your computer on. This step can drastically improve your computer's startup time.

It usually comes down to the information, resources, links, and pages being laid out in a way that is easy to see and use. To get ideas about how to design your own site, look at sites which do similar things to get ideas about where you should put different types of content.


Stay realistic to your skills.
Ease of access is the most important thing. If you don't have a certain piece of information easily visible, make sure that getting to that information is very logical.
Generally the simpler the design, the fewer the pages, the better.

, If you already have a fairly good idea about what your website will focus on, skip this step. If not, here are some things to help you figure that out. First, understand that there are billions of people on the Internet, and a large percentage have websites. If you limit yourself to something that hasn't been done, you'll never get started.


When you think, ""Internet,"" what is the first thing that comes to your mind? E-commerce? Music? News? Socializing? Blogging? Those are all good places to start.
You could create a website that's dedicated to your favorite band, and have a chat area where people can talk about it.
You can build a page for your family, but be careful about things like this. The internet is full of unsavory characters and information you put up about your family could end up being used against you. Consider adding password protection to your personal family website.
If you're a news junkie, or want something less filtered than traditional media, build a website and get publicly available feeds from news providers such as Reuters, BBC, AP, and others. Build your own customized news aggregator (what used to go by the quaint name of ""newspaper""), then see and show all the news that's fit to digitize.
If you're creative at writing then you can start a blog where you can write about anything you want and attract monthly readers!

, Building your website is going to take a commitment of time and possibly money, so set a limit on both, and then dig in. The plan doesn't have to be a big, complicated spreadsheet, or a fancy graphic presentation, but at the very least, you will want to consider what it will do for you and the visitors, what you'll put on the website, what goes where on the webpages.

, There are lots of different types of content and many have their own considerations. You'll need to figure out what's best for your website and your needs. Some things to consider including:



A store. If you want to sell things, you'll need to figure out how you want the items to be available. If you have relatively few things to sell, you might want to consider having a store with a hosting service. Society6, Amazon, and Cafepress are all well-established store hosts which let you sell a variety of items and set your own prices.

Media. Do you want to display videos? Music? Do you want to host your own files or do you want them hosted somewhere else? Youtube and SoundCloud are great examples of hosting options, but you'll need to be sure that the way you design your website allows these media types to display correctly.

Images. Are you a photographer? An artist? If you plan on putting original images on your website, you might want to use a format that can help keep them from getting stolen. Make sure the images are relatively small or that they are hidden behind some Flash code, so as to keep them from being easily saveable.

Widgets. These are mini-programs which run on your website, usually to help you keep track of who visits, what they're looking for, and where they're from. You can also find widgets for booking appointments, displaying a calendar, etc. Look into what might be useful for you (just make sure the widget comes from a reputable source).

Contact information. Do you want to have contact information on your webpage? For your own safety, you should be careful about what kind of information you have available. You should never display things like your home address or home phone number, as information like this can be used to steal your identity. You may want to set up a PO box or a special email address for people to contact you at, if you don't have a business address.

, For most people, the website starts on the home page. This is the page that everybody sees when they first go to www.yourSite.com. But where do they go from there? If you spend some time thinking about how people might interact with your site, you'll have a much easier time down the line when you are making navigation buttons and links.

, In recent years, smartphones and tablets have become incredibly popular platforms for browsing the internet, and they require websites to be designed for them. If you really want to make a website that will stand the test of time and be accessible to the highest number of viewers, plan on making different versions of your site for different devices, or plan to use a responsive design that adjusts as necessary.

, When you have the basic idea down and have a plan for how it will be laid out, the next to think about is how you're going to build it. The options seem endless, and people will try to sell you this or that 'fantastic' application, and every other thing that you ""absolutely must have"" on your site, however the reality is that there are a few great tools for building websites, and one of them will be best-suited to your situation and needs.

, This is the first option. If you have a website-building application like Adobe Dreamweaver, it is not very difficult to create a website from scratch. You might need to do some coding but don't panic! HTML looks complicated, but it's like listening to Shakespeare—it's hard at first, but once you get the feel of it, it's not that difficult.


Pros: website design software simplifies the process of building sites by letting you drag-and-drop images, text, buttons, movies, and anything else you can think of, usually without ever having to dig into HTML. Many web design applications will even let you create sites specifically for your smart phone or pad. If you are building a basic, personal website, this is really a great way to go.
Cons: there is a learning curve, and though you don't have to dig into HTML, it's not totally geek-free. If you are in a hurry, this might not be the best solution. Perhaps the biggest con, though, is that if you are not a graphic designer, you could end up with a page that hurts the eyes. To mollify this somewhat, there are a number of free templates in the applications, and on the internet, but be aware of your limitations—if you have any!

, This is the second option. WordPress is an example of a great option for building websites. It helps you create web pages and blog posts quickly and easily, set up the menus, allow and manage user comments, and has thousands of themes and plugins that you can choose from and use for free. Drupal and Joomla are other great CMS options. Once the CMS is hosted, you can manage your site from anywhere (in the world) that has an Internet connection.


Pros: Very easy to use, quick to get started with one click install, and lots of options for the beginner (with enough depth for more experienced users).
Cons: Some themes are limiting, and not all are free.

, This is the third option. If you decide to build your website from scratch, you'll need to start using HTML and CSS. There are ways to extend your HTML skills and add more features and more depth to your website. If you are developing a professional website, these tools will help you get that edge that is needed in any business venture.



CSS, which stands for ""Cascading Style Sheets"". CSS gives more flexibility for styling the HTML, and makes it much easier to make basic changes—fonts, headers, color schemes—in one place, and have those changes ripple through the site.

XHTML is a web language set by W3C's standards. Almost identical to HTML, it follows a stricter set of rules for marking up information. What this means, for the most part, is minor changes to the way you write code.
Look into HTML5. It's the fifth revision of the core HTML standard, and will eventually subsume the current version of HTML (HTML4), and XHTML as well.
Learn a client-side scripting language, such as JavaScript. This will increase your ability to add interactive elements to your site, such as charts, maps, etc.
Learn a server-side scripting language. PHP, ASP with JavaScript or VB Script or Python can be used to change the way web pages appear to different people, and lets you edit or create forums. They can also help store information about people who visit your site, like their username, settings, and even temporary ""shopping carts"" for commercial sites.
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique of using a browser sided language and a server sided language to make the page get new information from the server without refreshing the page, often greatly reducing user wait time and vastly improving the user's experience but increasing bandwidth usage. For a website that will see a lot of traffic, or an eCommerce site, this is an excellent solution.

, This is the fourth and final option. If you are not up to designing your own website, or learning new coding languages—especially for more advanced sites—hiring a professional may be your best option. Before you hire, ask to see a portfolio of their work, and check their references carefully.

, If you’re on a budget, there are strategies for buying a cheap domain name. Find a domain name that is easy to remember and easy to spell. If you use domains ending with .com, you will end up with more traffic, but most of the easy ones are taken, so be creative!


Look to Network Solutions, GoDaddy, or Register.com are good in US and uk2.net if you're in the UK to research and find the ideal domain name for your website. Wordpress also includes a feature whereby you can use a name that's tagged with their site, for example, mywebsite.wordpress.com. But if the name you choose is also available as a .com, they will notify you when you sign up.
You can purchase domain names if they have been ""parked"" or are for sale online through business sales sites. It's a good idea to get legal and financial advice before purchasing an expensive domain name.

, Before you post your site, it's wise to test it thoroughly. Most web design software has a way to test your site without taking it online. Look for missing tags, broken links, search engine optimization, and website design flaws. These are all factors which may affect your website's traffic and revenues. You may also generate a free full-functioning site map to submit to search engines like Google, in a matter of minutes.

, When you finish your website, do usability testing. You can do this by asking a few friends or family members to try it out. Give them a specific task like ""edit your profile"" or ""buy an alpaca sweater from the bargains page."" Sit behind them and watch them navigate—do not help them. You will likely find areas where you need to improve navigation or clarify some instructions. Alternately use something like zurb.com to user test on specific demographics for different types of engagement. When testing a website in 2014 it's becoming important to keep the platform in mind and make sure the website is usable from smartphones and tablets as well as desktops.


Keep a list of things you notice that seem difficult or non-intuitive for the user.

, Choose a web host and upload your website. Your web host may have an FTP feature, or you can download your own FTP program like FileZilla or CyberDuck. If you hired a professional to design the website, they should be able to take care of this for you (but it still pays to ask questions so that you understand what is happening).


Note that there are ways to host your own website for free.

, If you're doing this for money, which ideas stand to make the most profit? Which ideas require the most commitment? Which ideas look like they'd be fun to pursue? You will be spending time working on your website, so choose the idea you are most passionate about (that is also profitable and practical for you).

, The website you create may be for fun, it may be for profit, or some combination of the two. Knowing your expectations makes it much easier both to design your website, and to track and make sense of the results.

, Content sites require less investment but they also face more competition, since anyone can start a content site. To make money from this kind of site, you provide information and generate income from the traffic you receive through advertising, such as through Google AdSense. In order to optimize AdSense, you will have to write your content purposefully and make it interesting so that people come to your site. Use specific keywords directed at people searching for specific terms too; just don't get carried away with this aspect or the content may suffer and readers won't like it.

, eCommerce sites, which sell products, will need more maintenance and attention. You will need to think about shipping, sales, taxes, SSL, inventory updates, and everything that a person with a brick-and-mortar storefront would have to manage. A system for prompt answering of questions and dealing with complaints is essential when selling products online; many companies also offer phone help, which you can outsource offshore if need be.


If the goal is just to add a stream of income, you can also sell other people's products through affiliate programs, letting you earn money without investing in product or worrying about shipping.

, Which kinds of people will your website serve? Conduct market research to figure out more about your audience. Things to know or find out include: What do they do? How old are they? What are their other interests? All of this information can help make your website much more useful. However, be careful of assuming that your site is only targeting one group––always watch for trends that show other types of people becoming interested, so that you can cater for their interests too and make the most of new opportunities.

, This is necessary to determine whether people are searching for topics that are relevant to your site and can be useful for learning more about your potential clients. Making a conscious effort to incorporate in-demand keywords into the site can also help you get a better search engine ranking. There are tools available from Google (ex. google.com/trends/ and google.com/insights/search/#), Overture, and third-party software developers that can make the keyword research process easier.


Sprinkle the keywords you've chosen throughout your text, but not insofar as it hurts the quality of your content.
Creating pages that are optimized for the search engines will help you get your site found which is really more important than design. What good is a site that no one sees?

, Now that it's out there, you want people to come, so let them know!


Submit your site to major search engines. There are sites that will do this for you, or you can do it yourself.
Tell your friends. Tweet about it—constantly! Add it to your Facebook status updates, post pictures of it on Flickr, add it to your LinkedIn account—anywhere and everywhere is the key here. The more people coming to your site, the better.
Use an e-mail address with your domain. Visit other websites that complement (not compete with) yours, and offer to exchange links or guest blog/write. Post constructively on blogs and forums, and put your URL in your signature.
Use article marketing. Creating SEO-optimized articles and posting them to other sites is a sometimes a useful way to create back-links to your website. This might help you to boost your website’s search engine ranking but always keep abreast of search engine updates that often impact SEO strategies and can render them less helpful or even downgrade your site's ranking.

, Most of all, listen to your readers and customers and learn from their experience with your website.


Take constructive comments seriously. Other band members, fans, and friends may all have easier navigation ideas.
Think about your target market or audience: their needs, their frustrations, their circumstances. As much as possible, seek to make their lives easier or more informed.

Open Notepad.,
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses tags.,
The first tag of a webpage is usually: <html>.,
The next tag is <head>.,
On the next line after your head tag, put a title: <title>wikiHow HTML</title>

,Now end your head by typing </head>

,
Next in our website comes the <body> tag.,
Between the two body tags goes the content of your webpage, what the user sees.,
Another tag that can go in the webpage body is the <p> tag, or paragraph tag.,
You probably don't want a webpage that's all plain text.,
What really makes a website interesting is pictures.,
Almost done!,To finish up, you need to end your body with </body>, and entire webpage with </html>

,
Save your work, making sure to save the file with '.html' at the end.,If you want to put your website on the web, see How to Publish a Website on Your Own Domain

",How to Create a Simple Webpage Using Notepad," Notepad is automatically installed on all Windows computers. You can find it in the Start Menu. Once you are in Notepad, click ""File"" and then click ""Save As"" in the dropdown menu. Choose ""All Files"" in the file type menu. Save your file as an HTML file. Usually, the main page of a website is known as ""index.html"" in order to be able to access everything on the website from that single page.

, Tags are basically some text inside of <angle brackets>.
You will use a variety of tags to create your webpage. There are also ""end tags"" which end a line of code. An example is of an end tag is:</text>.
These end things like a bold font or a paragraph.

,
You can put this at the top of your Notepad file.

,
The next tag, <title>, tells the browser what to put at the top of the window, and the optional meta tags, tells search engines like Google what the site is about.

,,, Please note that not all colors are supported on all browsers. (for instance, dark grey probably wouldn't be supported on most browsers)

, Let's start with a header. A header a a section of large text, and is specified in HTML with <h1> through <h6>, with <h1> being the largest. So at the top of your webpage, after the body tag, might be something like <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1> Make sure you remember the end tag, or your whole webpage will be in giant!

, So after your header, you might have <p>. I'm learning how to make a website! wikiHow rules!If you want a new line in your site, use the <br> tag, or break tag.

, So let's put in some formatting. <b> for bold text, <i> for italics, and <u> for underlining. Remember your end tags!

, Even with formatting, who wants to look at endless words? Use the <img> tag to do this. But, like the body tag, it needs some extra information. An img tag might look like this: <img alt=dog src=""dog.jpg"" width=200 height=200>.
The src (source) is what the picture is called. The width and height are the width and height of the picture in pixels.

, You want your visitors to be able to see more than just one page. To create links, use: <a href=""otherpage.html"">Another page</a>.
The text in between the tags is what the user clicks on to get to the next page, and the href part is where their click takes them. Using a tags you can let your users move effortlessly around your website.

,, Open the .html file in your favourite web browser to see how it looks. Congratulations! You just made a webpage.

To start the check press Start Readiness Check


,, Magento needs it to store information.

Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in a new tab.






Press New






Make the database name magento, leave all other settings default and press Create






Once you get a prompt telling you that Database magento has been created."" you should navigate back to the tab where you have your Magento installer open.






Press Next. If you have named your database something different just swap magento in the Database Name field for whatever you named yours.







,


This is completely optional, but you can change the Magento Admin Address to just Admin as while this lowers the security of Magento we am in a local environment and the only person who has access to it is us (unless you have configured your server to be publicly accessible). This is a good idea as you will not loose any security and it makes it much easier to remember.






You can also change some settings under Advanced Options for instance, you can tell Magento to use https:// layer instead of the unencrypted and much less safe http:// layer for your admin and shopping cart areas. This is a good option to consider if you decide to publish your website.
There are a few other options to consider too, but all of these options are changeable later on in the admin area, so if you change your mind later on down the track you don't have to reinstall Magento.
If you are done you can press Next







,


Set your default time zone, currency, and language by scrolling through the drop-down menus.






There are also some module settings, but as usual you can change them later but the default settings should be fine.
Once you are done you can proceed by pressing Next







,


Enter a username, an email and a password (you'll need to repeat this). For the username Admin was used, as we are in a local environment you can use whatever email you want and you can make your password whatever you want but it is good to get into the habit of using strong ones.
When you have done this you can continue by pressing the Next button.

, Well done! All your configuration is done and all that is left is for Magento to be installed. Just hit Install Now to start!

, Once Magento has installed itself you should:


Take a screenshot of the success screen if you are liable to forget some of the important information,
Go to the admin panel by pressing Launch Magento Admin,

,
Choose a good browser.,
Secure your Wi-Fi connection.,
Choose the right plan for the right purpose.,
Use ad-blocker softwares/extensions/add-ons.,
Check everything is clean.",How to Improve Your BSNL Internet Connection (India)," Use the following DNS addresses to do this:


On dial-up or bridge mode broadband connections: Enter the following DNS address at local area connection or wireless network connection: Primary DNS -- 192.168.1.1 (filling this IP will automatically takes first DNS server from BSNL)
Alternate DNS -- 156.154.70.1 or 156.154.71.1 or 4.2.2.2 or 208.67.222.222 or 208.67.220.220 or 8.8.4.4 or 8.8.8.8 (use any of these).;
, The SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) value at downstream must be greater than 13 dB. See the ""DSL Line Parameters in Modem Interface Page"" under the heading Overview or Device Info or Status or Statistics in the modem interface/configuration page, (the names differ as different modems have different styles of interfaces). If the SNR value is lower than 13 dB, then insist on a change of line (drop wire), jumper, vertical, DP or line pair.

, The attenuation value at downstream must be less than 45 dB. See the ""DSL Line Parameters in Modem Interface Page"" under headings such as Overview or Device Info or Status or Statistics for your modem. If the value is greater than 43 dB, then insist for a change of phone line (drop wire), jumper, vertical, DP or line pair.


Broadband may work on a value higher than 45 dB but this would be likely at a slow speed, with frequent disconnections and time-outs.
Practically, it’s not possible to provide a line with exact value of attenuation.

, Almost all MTU sizes (like 1500, 1492 or 1480) give good speed performance for website browsing and downloading. However, preferably use 1492 as MTU in all modem/router connections until and unless you face any significant problems with MTU.


The value is defined inside the modem or router configuration page.

, Modems from different companies or different models of modem have different internal circuitry and they read line parameters differently. So, if the line parameters are not at the recommended levels, then try to change the modem to see whether this makes any difference. The modems like Netgear, Teracom, Huawei, UT-Star, TP-link, D-link, and Link Sys perform exceptionally well, even in poor signal-to-noise ratio conditions. That means if your house is at considerable distance from your BSNL exchange, naturally the line attenuation will be more and the cheap quality modems used at your home would fail to perform reliably or read line profile accurately.

, Always enable NAT, firewall and default route check-boxes (features) in the modem configuration/interface page.

, The ADSL splitter must be used on a telephone line at the subscriber's premises if the user has broadband connection. It actually divides the main (frequency) telephone line coming from exchange into the phone (low frequency) and broadband (high frequency) connection. So, a modem must be fed with a pure ADSL signal.

, The physical layout of line must be in accordance with the technical norms followed for a broadband connection. Namely, the phone line coming from the DP (Distribution Point) must be first terminated at an ADSL splitter in a subscriber's home

,,,, Use browsers like Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome for web surfing. These browsers are much faster, safer and more reliable than the conventional Internet Explorer, which has been embedded in many of the former versions of Windows.

, Never let your wireless modem or router be unsecured. Use WEP-128 bits or WPA security key settings. Choose a strong key but an easy-to-remember Wi-Fi password containing both letters and digits. You may also use MAC based security, which is the strongest security that enables only systems which are present in the MAC list to have internet access.

, Use the right broadband plan for right kind of activity. Suppose that you want to use only audio chat. Then you should have a connection with more than 128kbps of speed. If you want to use video chat, then use a connection with a speed of 512 kbps or more.


The speed of 256 kbps is fine for email checking and browsing different websites.
For multitasking, prefer high speed broadband plans.

, Use ad-blocker softwares/extensions/add-ons for web browsers to block unnecessary Ads in your web page. This will increase the total web browsing experience.

, Wires and connections installed in pillars and DP boxes should be free from dust and rust, to ensure good line parameters.

",How to Create a Google Map With Excel Data and Fusion Tables," There are several formats that could be used, but we're going to use a Comma Separated Value (.csv) spreadsheet like Excel to organize our data. You can put any kind of information that might be useful into this .csv file, but be sure to include the full address in one field. Download the sample address.csv file suggested in the ""Sources and Citations"" below. Below is an example of what a row of data would look like:
Joe's Diner, 1 Main St Lakewood NY 14750, 800-123-4567;
, Open a web browser and go to https://www.google.com/fusiontables. If you have a Google account, use that to sign in. If you don't have a Google account then you'll have to create one.

, What you will do first is click the gray ""New Table"" button that is on the left of the screen. This will bring up a drop-down menu where you will then select ""Import Table"".

, In this window, you'll be given options as to where you will import from. ""From This Computer"" will be selected, which is what you want, and you'll then click the ""Choose File"" button. This will allow you to browse through your computer and select the address.csv (or whatever .csv file you wish to use) to upload to the fusion tables site. Once you've selected it, click the ""Next"" button on the bottom right.

, Once finished, you'll see a preview of the data and all the columns in the spreadsheet. There will be a check box above each column, columns that will be imported will have a check mark. If your spreadsheet had a header row for column names, it should have known this and selected that row as the header. Click the ""Next"" button.

, You can leave these settings as they are. Click on the ""Finish"" button on the bottom right to create the fusion table.


When the import has finished you'll see a table view of your data. Any column that is able to be translated into a map location will be highlighted in yellow and will have a small globe icon next to it when the mouse is over that field. For our address.csv file, the address column is highlighted. If you click that globe, it will translate the address to a Latitude/Longitude location. But we don't have to do that, later the fusion table will do it for us!
If your data does not have a column highlighted in yellow, that means that the Fusion Tables weren't able to automatically pick a column that specified a location. To do this, click the Edit menu, then select Edit Columns. From here you will click on the column that holds your location data. After clicking, on the right you will see a drop down list labeled Type. Select Location from the drop down list, then click Save in the bottom left of this screen. After this, your column should be highlighted yellow.

,, On the right of the screen there is a share button; click it. You'll see that this table is set to private, so you will have to change it to Unlisted or Public in order to have it viewed in your website. It is recommended that you select ""Unlisted"" – this means you can share the data – but people can't search for and find it on the FusionTables site. After selecting ""Unlisted"", click the X in the top right to close this screen.

, There is a new version and we need to see the old Classic version to map it. Click on Help, Back to Classic Look. This is so easy, it's almost wrong. In the Menu there are options for File, View, Edit, Visualize, Merge. Click ""Visualize"" and then select ""Map"".


Your address data is now automatically translated into a map location and a map marker is placed on a Google Map for each valid location!

, This will display a text box with automatically generated html code for you to place on your web page. Also notice that if you click a marker, all the information for that record shows up in a nice message window.

, Click the Visualize menu and select ""Table""; you'll see the rows that were not translated are still highlighted in yellow. Click the globe icon next to the address and you'll be able to manually search for and select a matching location.

, The image here shows the final product, or you can visit: http://www.chautauquahomes.us/wikihow/FusionTables/ to see the live example.


If you feel like it, you can click on the ""Configure Info Window"" or ""Configure Styles"" links in order to customize the look and feel of the map markers and the message display window.

, If your map marker wasn't placed where you thought it should be, you are able to manually search the map for the exact location! Visualize your fusion data as a Table, move your mouse cursor over the column that is used as the map location and you will see an image that resembles a globe. Click it.

, You will see a red marker for where the current location is set.

, You will see green markers show on the map telling you where Google thinks your location is.

All Roku models have HDMI ports. These look like elongated USB ports, and are used to connect to HDTVs. HDMI cables carry both video and audio from the Roku to the TV, and provide the highest quality image and video. For many Roku models, this is the only video connection port available.
Almost every Roku model has an Ethernet port that it uses to connect to your router. The port looks like a larger phone line connection. Some of the older models only use Wi-Fi.
Newer Roku models like the Roku 4 may have an Optical connection. This lets you send the audio signal to your home theater receiver
Older Roku models may have composite A/V (three prong) connectors. Note that on some Roku models, the A/V connection may be a single port with a cable that splits into three prongs. These can be used for older TVs, but many newer HDTVs do not support these connections. You cannot get an HD image with composite cables.;
, Once you've identified the ports on your Roku, you'll want to find the highest quality matching port on your TV. For most HDTVs, you'll want to use one of your TV's HDMI ports.


Ports may be located on the back of the TV, along the side, or in some rare cases on the front panel.
If your Roku only has an HDMI port and your TV does not have any HDMI ports, you may be out of luck. You'll need to either find an older Roku that can connect via composite cables, or upgrade your TV to one that has HDMI ports.

, If you're setting up a secondhand Roku, you may want to clear any old settings before setting it up. Plug the Roku into a power outlet. Use a paperclip to press and hold the Reset button on the back or bottom of the Roku for 15 seconds. This will clear all of the internal memory, allowing you to set it up as if it were new., This is the simplest way to connect the Roku to your TV, and will also result in the best quality. For many Roku devices, this is the only way to connect. If you don't have an HDMI cable, you can pick up a cheap one online or from most electronics departments. For the most part, there is little to no difference between an expensive HDMI cable and a cheap one. Just make sure you get one that is long enough to reach from the Roku to the TV with some slack.


If you're connecting via composite A/V cables, match the colors on the cable plugs to the colors of the connectors.
Make note of the input label on the TV when connecting so that you can easily switch to the correct input.

, If you want to use a wired connection, you can use an Ethernet cable to connect the Ethernet port on the Roku to an open LAN port on your router. This may provide a better streaming experience, especially in apartment complexes or other areas with lots of Wi-Fi interference. All Roku devices support Wi-Fi as well, so this step isn't required.

, Use the included power adapter to connect the Roku to an outlet on the wall or power strip.

, If you bought the Roku new, it should come with two AA batteries. Insert these into the remote by removing the battery cover on the back. Leave the back off once you're finished.

, Use the INPUT button on your TV remote to select the HDMI or composite input that the Roku is connected to.


If you don't see the Roku logo or the language menu, check to make sure that you've selected the correct input and that the Roku is plugged into a power outlet.

, Before you can select your language, a pop-up will appear with visual instructions for pairing your remote.


Remove the battery cover from the back of the remote if you put it back on.
Press and hold the Pairing button at the bottom for 3 seconds.
Wait while the Roku pairs with the remote.

, This is the language that all of the Roku menus will be displayed in. You can change this later from the Settings menu.

, Press the OK button on your remote to select ""Let's get started."" This will run you through the initial setup.

, Roku requires an internet connection in order to stream video, so you'll need to set how you want to connect.


Select ""Wireless"" to scan for any available wireless network. Choose your network from the list and enter the password if necessary. If you don't see your network, make sure your Roku is in range.
If you're connected via Ethernet, select ""Wired."" You won't have to perform any additional configuration.

, Occasionally, new version of the Roku software will be released, and the Roku can download and install these updates. If updates are available when setting up your internet connection, you will be prompted to download and install them immediately. Software updates generally lead to a more stable viewing experience.


The Roku will automatically restart after the update is downloaded and installed.

, You'll need to activate your Roku before you can start using it. You'll see a code displayed on the screen. Visit roku.com/link on any computer, phone, or tablet and enter the code from your TV screen to link your Roku with your Roku account. If you don't have a Roku account, you'll be prompted to create a free one.

, You'll be prompted for this PIN whenever making a purchase to prevent unauthorized purchases. This is especially important for families or for those that share the Roku with lots of other people. You can create a PIN when setting up your Roku account.

, Select the ""Streaming Channels"" from the Roku main menu and browse through the available channels. When you find one you want, select it and then choose ""Add channel."" It will be added to your Home list. Note that some channels may require additional subscriptions.

, Select a channel from your Roku main menu to begin browsing streaming titles. You'll likely be prompted to log in with your account for that channel. For example, to use the Netflix channel, you'll need a separate Netflix streaming subscription. You'll then be able to log in with your Netflix account."

, Your search engine queries are associated with your IP address (and account if you are logged in). These are compiled and analyzed to more accurately target ads and provide relevant search results.

, If your computer is logged into any social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), these networks will be able to track your browsing history if the websites you visit have social network plugins (""Like"" buttons, Retweets, etc.).

, This is most commonly used to determine if customers are using the network to download torrents of copyrighted materials.

, No matter how much you cover your tracks, there is always some information that can potentially be used to profile and potentially identify you. The goal of using anonymity tools is to reduce the amount of information available, but due to the nature of the internet, you cannot ever be truly anonymous.

, It's not exactly easy to stay anonymous online, and requires a significant amount of conscious effort. You'll face much slower connections when browsing websites, and you'll have to jump through more hoops before you even go online. If your anonymity is important to you, be prepared to make some sacrifices.


The next section will cover how to keep your personal information from being tied to your IP address, but does not guarantee anonymity. To increase your anonymity online, see the two sections at the end of this article.

, Make sure that the email address does not contain any personal information, and is not tied to any accounts that store your personal information.



Click here for details on creating a disposable email address.;
, Major search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo! all track your searches and tie them to your IP address. Use an alternative search engine that does not track your searches, such as DuckDuckGo or StartPage.

, If you've used the internet for more than a week, chances are you have a hefty number of passwords to keep track of. It can be tempting to use the same password, or slight variations, for multiple sites to make things easier for you, but this is a massive security risk. If one website with your password and email is hacked, every site that you use that same combination with is in jeopardy. A password manager will remember the passwords for each site you visit, allowing you to create strong and even random passwords for each one.



Click here for detailed instructions on setting up a password manager.
With a password manager, you don't need to worry about creating a password you can remember. Instead, you can create strong passwords that are virtually impossible to crack. ""Kz2Jh@ds3a$gs*F%7"" is a much stronger password than ""MyDogName1983"".

, When it comes to online anonymity, things can get technical real quick. Before you start diving in, it will help to have a basic understand of some of the more common terms.



Traffic - In networking terms, traffic is the transfer of data from one computer to another.

Server - This is a computer located remotely that hosts files and sets up connections. All websites are stored on servers that you access using your web browser.

Encryption - This is the act of protecting data sent over a network by using a randomly generated code. When data is encrypted, it is scrambled according to the unique code that only you and the server have. This ensures that if the data is intercepted, it cannot be decoded.

Proxy - A proxy server is a server that is configured to collect and then resend network traffic. In essence, a proxy server allows you to connect to it, and then it will send out your requests for websites. It then receives the data from the websites and then sends it to you. This has the benefit of hiding your IP address from the website you are accessing.

VPN - A VPN is a Virtual Private Network. This is an encrypted connection between you and a server. It is traditionally used in corporate environments so that remote workers could remotely and securely access company resources. A VPN can be thought of as a ""tunnel"" through the internet that connects you directly with a server.

, There are thousands of web-based proxies available, and they change every day. These are websites that route traffic through the proxy server. They only affect traffic going through that website; open another tab in your browser and anything you send will be anonymously sent.When using a web-based proxy, avoid any sites that use secure login (Facebook, banking, etc.) as proxy sites should never be trusted.
Most web-based proxies cannot display certain content such as videos.

, A proxy server is a a server that relays your internet traffic. This has the benefit of masking your personal IP address from sites when you connect through a proxy. The downside is that you have to trust the proxy server to not do anything malicious with your traffic.


There are a wide variety of proxy services available online, both free and paid. Free servers are typically ad-supported.
Once you've found a proxy server that you want to connect to, you will need to configure your browser to connect to the server. This will only affect the traffic that originates from your browser (i.e. an instant messaging program will not be relayed through the proxy server unless it is configured to as well).
Much like web-based proxies, you should avoid logging into anything secure, as you cannot trust a proxy company to not divulge your data.
Do not connect to any ""open"" proxies. These are proxy servers that have been left open by someone else, and are typically malicious or illegal.

, A virtual private network will encrypt your traffic to and from the network, increasing your privacy. It will also make your traffic appear to be originating from the VPN server, much like a proxy server. Most VPNs cost money, and many will still log your traffic in order to comply with government requests.


Don't trust any VPN company that says it doesn't log anything. No VPN will risk getting shut down to protect a single customer from a government request.

, Tor is a network that acts as multiple proxies, bouncing your traffic between multiple relays before reaching the destination or you. Only traffic that goes through the Tor Browser will be anonymized, and browsing using the Tor Browser will be significantly slower than regular web surfing.



Click here for detailed information about using Tor., If you want to browse truly anonymously, there are several things you'll want to set up before going online. This may seem like a lot of hassle, but following these steps is the only way to ensure that you have some semblance of anonymity online.


This method will help you configure your own person VPN on your own personal, out-of-country server. This is much more secure than subscribing to a VPN service, as you can't always trust a company to be safe with your data.

, Your computer has a lot of services that connect to the internet, each of which can compromise your online anonymity without you realizing it. Windows is especially insecure, as well as Mac OS X to a lesser extent. The first step to being anonymous is to install Linux to a virtual machine, which is like a computer within a computer.A virtual computer has a ""wall"" around it that prevents any data from crossing over to your physical computer. This is essential for keeping your physical computer's signature from showing up while browsing anonymously.

Click here for detailed instructions on installing Linux on a virtual machine. The entire process is free, but may take about an hour.
TailsOS is one of the most popular privacy-oriented Linux distributions. It is very lightweight and entirely encrypted.

, This will set you back a few dollars every month, but will help ensure that you are browsing anonymously. It is important to subscribe to a VPS in another country, so that traffic to and from the VPS can't be tracked to your home IP address.


You will be using your VPS to install VPN (Virtual Private Network) software onto. This will allow you to connect through your VPN, masking your actual IP address.
Pick a VPS service that allows you to pay with methods that don't reveal your identity, such as DarkCoin.
Once you sign up for a VPS, you'll need to install your own operating system on it. Install one of the following Linux distributions to allow easy setup for your VPN: Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, or Debian.
Note that your VPS provider can still be hit with a court order to reveal your VPN information if your government suspects that illegal activity is happening on your VPN. There really isn't much you can do to prevent this.

, The VPN is what your computer will connect to in order to access the internet. This will essentially make it appear as if you are browsing from the VPS's location, not your home, as well as encrypt all data to and from the VPS. This step is a little more complicated than installing a virtual operating system. It is arguably the most important step however, so if anonymity is important to you, make sure to complete this. These steps are specifically for OpenVPN on Ubuntu, one of the more reliable free VPN solutions.Log into your VPS operating system. The process for this will vary depending on the VPS service you choose.
Visit the OpenVPN website and download the correct software package. There will be multiple options, so make sure to choose the correct one for your VPS's operating system. You can find all the available downloads at openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/download-openvpn-as-sw.html

Open the terminal on your VPS and type dpkg -i openvpnasdebpack.deb to install the OpenVPN software that you downloaded. The command will be different if you're not using Ubuntu or Debian.
Type passwd openvpn and set a new password when prompted. This will be the admin password for your OpenVPN software.
Open the web browser on your VPS and enter in the address displayed in the terminal. This will open the OpenVPN control panel. Log in with the username openvpn and the password you created. Once you log in for the first time, your VPN is ready to go.

, You will need to access the OpenVPN Connect Client to download the configuration file needed for your connection program.


Enter in the same address you used on the VPS to access the admin panel, without the /admin part of the address.
Login with your OpenVPN admin account using ""openvpn"" as the username and the password you created earlier.
Download the client.opvn or client.conf file onto your virtual computer.

, Once your VPN is configured on your VPS, you'll need to set up your virtual computer to connect directly to it. The following instructions are for Ubuntu and Debian, so you may need to change the commands to match your OS.


Open the terminal and type sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome

Wait for the package to download and install.
Open the Network Manager and click the ""VPN"" tab.
Click the ""Import"" button and then select the configuration file that you downloaded.
Review your settings. The Certificate and Key fields should populate automatically, and your VPN address should appear in the Gateway field.
Click the ""IPV4 Settings"" tab and select ""Automatic (VPN) addresses only"" from the Methods drop-down menu. This will ensure that all of your internet traffic is routed through the VPN.

, At this point, with your VPS and VPN configured and running, you're browsing with pretty strong anonymity. Your VPN will encrypt all traffic to and from your virtual machine. If you want to take it one step further, the Tor Browser can add another layer of protection, at the cost of browsing speed.You can download the Tor browser from torproject.org

Running Tor through your VPN will hide the fact that you are using Tor from your ISP (they will only see encrypted VPN traffic).
Run the Tor installation program. The default settings will provide comprehensive protection for most users.
For more detailed information on using Tor, click here.

, if you're very concerned about anonymity, you'll want to change VPS providers at least monthly. This means reconfiguring OpenVPN each time, but you'll get faster and faster at it as you repeat the process. Make sure to completely reset a VPS before you switch to the new one., Now that everything is configured, the strength of your anonymity rests on your browsing habits.


Use alternative search engines like DuckDuckGo or StartPage.
Avoid any sites with Javascript. Javascript code can be used to reveal IP addresses and deanonymize your traffic.
Disconnect from the Tor network when opening files that you downloaded through Tor.
Do not download torrent files while connected to the Tor network.
Avoid any site that does not use HTTPS (Look in the address bar to see if the site is using HTTP or HTTPS).
Avoid installing browser plugins.

If your back up is a simple copy, your programs will – in many cases – actually still work, since a Mac program mostly is one big file and not a lot of small files everywhere in the system.
Your settings and preference files can also be backed up, and using TM will replace them correctly without you having to think about placing.
See this guide for details on backing up your data.
